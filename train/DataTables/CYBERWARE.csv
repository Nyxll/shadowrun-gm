CT-???,Sub Speakers,0.10,650,2.00,,"Usually mounted under the skin just behind the ear, these tiny speakers vibrate various bones in the ear to transmit sound. Sound comIng over them cannot be overheard."
CT-???,Cybercomm Link,0.40,62000,3.00,,"The cybercomm link consists of a transducer and a radio transmitter. The transducer translates thoughts Into words, so that the user need not speak aloud; the transmitter sends and receives these unspoken Impulses. No external evidence of this system's use is visible or audible. Quadruples the number of spoken words allowed in a Free Action (p. 81, SRII)."

CT-???,Protective Covers,0.00,500,1.50,,"Protects cyber and normal eyes against impact and particles. Available in standard transparent or one-way reflective material; one-way adds 20 percent to the price. At the gamemaster's discretion, covers give 1 point of Impact Armor to the eye area."
CT-???,Eye Dataport,0.25,2200,2.00,,"One type is an eye dataport, the other an optical scanning datajack. The dataport sits behind the iris of the cybereye, You reach up, apply a little pressure to the iris, and it opens to reveal a standard dataport. This toy is handy for sleazing your way into places that someone might try to keep you out of if you happened to be wearing a standard (and visible) datajack. It's tough to tell what's buried in a cybereye without dissecting the whole thing. Drawback is, you end up standing around with your eye plugged into something. Very weird-likely to attract attention if anyone happens along."
CT-???,Optical Scan DJ,0.30,5500,3.00,,"The optical scanning datajack includes an emitter unit and a data receptor. The receptor sits In your eye; the emitter you carry around (it's no bigger than a silver oxide battery). You stick the emitter unit onto the data-out port on whatever you came hunting for and you look at it. The data receptor in your eye reads the laser beam put out by the emitter and decodes the data transmitted over it. Dozens of uses for this, neh? It's cutting edge drek, but becoming more available."
CT-???,Eye Light Systems,0.20,1200,1.50,,"Eye lights, another nifty new piece of work, can be either a tool or a weapon. The plain-vanilla light system mounts high-powered, low-heat lights in the cybereye that channel a tight, polarized beam outward down a path parallel to the optical center of the eye. An amount of light sufficient to see with standard low-light eyes falls wherever the user is looking. The tight beam and polarization minimize scatter from the eye, so the light can't be seen unless someone's staring right at you."

Brights come in two intensities; the first is reusable and works just like a flash-pak.

Rounds cost four times the normal price. Firing requires a Special Skill or Quickness Test. Cannot be linked to any kind of aim enhancer. See p. 62, Street Samurai Catalog, for Narcoject weapons; p. 186, SRII, for toxins; and pp. 90, 92, 97, Shadowtech, for other compounds. After firing, a character must apply a +2 modifier to all visual tests for a period of (4 - Unaugmented Body) Combat Turns, for a minimum of 1 Combat Turn, For rules on the maximum capacity of the orbital socket, see Cyberware Rules, p. 45."
CT-???,Eye Gun,0.40,6400,3.00,,"Treat as a hold-out pistol with one-half range (round down), a -1 Damage modifier, and a +1 recoil modifier. One shot per reload. Reloading takes 10 Combat Turns, but a successful Biotech Test reduces the reload time by half the character's Quickness. Rounds cost five times the normal price. Firing requires a Special Skill or Quickness Test. Cannot be linked to any kind of aim enhancer.

These tests have a Base Target Number 4, with a +1 modifier to the target number for each meter or part thereof beyond 1. The Power of the attack is -1 against targets up to two meters away and -2 against targets up to four meters away. Will not penetrate reflective metals or silvered glass, but can cut mirrored plastics."
CT-???,Spatial Recognizer,0.20,1200,2.00,,"This cyberear accessory reduces the target numbers for Perception Tests based primarily on sound location by -2 whenever a character attempts to track something by listening for movement.
