Since Shadowrun first appeared in 1989, players and gamemasters have sent us megapulses of invaluable feedback on the game system. Much of that feedback included concerns about the complexity of Shadowrun's Matrix game mechanics and the sheer amount of playing time needed to create and map Matrix systems, build and upgrade cyberdecks, and conduct runs in the Matrix. Virtual Realities 2.0 (VR 2.0), the new Matrix sourcebook for Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRII), takes a fresh look at cyberspace and addresses these concerns. VR 2.0 provides new, streamlined rules for mapping Matrix systems, building and upgrading decks, conducting cybercombat, IC, utility programs-everything Involved in making a Matrix run. In addition, VR 2.0 provides entirely new software, programming tricks, and damage rules, and adds rules for creating and playing the mysterious otaku, the so-called "feral deckers" of the Matrix.

The human mind cannot directly comprehend the flow of data In the Matrix. If users were restricted to old-tech tools-command lines, file names, programs in clumsy procedural languages-the system would be unmanageable. For example, a user who wanted to read a computer file in 1995 would type in some wearisome command, find the file in a window, or access the desired information in some other, equally clumsy method. But after the Crash of 2029, ASIST technology opened up the possibilities of actual DNI (Direct Neural Interface) access to computers, and the Matrix was born. Now, the user takes a microsecond-long trip through a computer-generated landscape In order to find a file. If the user Is validated to see a file, he finds it right where he expects to find it. The interface routines he uses may look like clerical workers, or a huge library, or simply appear as dazzling patterns of energy. The user sees the file, touches it, and the data downloads into his cyberterminal. Users do not need to remember codes, command sets, or file names. If they want something, they go get it. If they want to program a process for the laboratory or an assembly line, they mentally perform the motions involved or build a model using virtual components, and the computer learns from them. Modern chemists, for example, build molecules according to formulae as if they were using children's building blocks. The computer then translates these actions into a program that will operate the process in the real world. Legitimate users have registered cyberterminals that identify themselves to the Matrix at every step. But the cyberdecks of deckers have no Matrix identifiers. Deckers remain anonymous, and when everything goes right they can dance through the secrets of the Matrix, laughing at security measures. Of course, when things go wrong, they can die in the Matrix as well.

These concepts remain unchanged from those presented in the basic Shadowrun rules. However, Virtual Realities 2.0 offers new game mechanics to simulate these concepts. The most important new game mechanics are system operations and System Tests. A system operation is simply a list of the game information a decker needs to perform a task in the Matrix. Each system operation lists the System Test(s) required to perform the chosen task, the name of any utility programs that augment the test, the type of action the decker has to expend to perform the task, and a description of what happens when he attempts to do so. (Several pre-designed system operations appear in the section titled System Operations, p. 108. A quick reference list of operations also appears in the Appendix, p. 162.)

Under the revised Matrix 2.0 rules, a System Test consists of an opposed test between the decker and the system he is infiltrating (note that the term System Test is used differently than In the Matrix 1.0 rules). The decker makes an appropriate Subsystem Test. The gamemaster makes a Security Test for the system against the deckers Detection Factor. This section provides an overview of these and other new game mechanics presented in Matrix 2:0. Subsequent sections provide more detailed instructions for using these new rules.

### ICONS

Every object a user sees in the Matrix is an icon. Users have special icons called personas. When we talk about a decker's persona, we may also refer to his icon, or his online icon. As real as the experience seems, a decker never physically enters the Matrix. His meatbod remains sitting where the cyberdeck connects to the Matrix, the jackpoint. The deck feeds the decker an ASIST signal, in the same way as a simsense set, that makes him think he is somewhere else. That somewhere else is the Matrix.

The persona programs and utilities running on the cyberdeck are master copies of the software that makes decking possible. When a decker logs on to a grid or host, the cyberdeck locs versions of those programs into the Matrix system. In a nutshell, deckers deal with two sets of programs: the front-end programs on the deck, which convert the decker's neural Impulses into computer command transactions; and server programs in the Matrix, which convert those commands into programming commands that influence what the system does. These online servers form the decker's persona. Through the persona, the decker experiences the environment of the system where he is active. The persona programs send transactions back from the Matrix to the cyberdeck, where the front-end programs convert them Into simsense experiences. This system creates two complexes: the meat decker and his front-end programs on the deck; and the deckers online icon, which runs on the computers that create the Matrix. Disconnect the deck, crash the persona, or sever the commlink that connects them, and the decker is offline, jacked our, dumped.

### GRIDS AND HOSTS

The Matrix consists of telecommunications networks (grids) and computer systems (hosts). Grids carry voice and data transmissions-everything from local phone calls to gigapulse data packets. Hosts are what used to be called mainframe computers, but mainframes in the Sixth World do not have to be single, powerful pieces of hardware. In fact, many of them are linked series of massive parallel processors in smaller configurations. These provide just as much jam as a single supercomputer. Simply put, a host in Shadowrun is any computer important enough for a decker to invade and tough enough to fight back.

### MATRIX TOPOLOGY

The connections between grids and hosts define the basic topology of the Matrix. Only four types of connections exist-open-access, tiered access, host-host access, and private grid-access connections. But multiply those connections by millions of hosts, criss-crossing through the guds, and you end up with a network so complex only a decker could love it!

#### Open Access

Most computer systems use the open-access connection. Quite simply, any host connected directly to a grid has an open-access connection. Any user, anywhere in the world, can use the public grids to access such hosts. All four of the Hosts in the Open Access Diagram are attached to the same LTG (Local Telecommunications Grid). A decker can access any of them by connecting to that LTG. If he is already logged on to one host, he can disconnect from that host and access another host without terminating his Matrix run.

#### Tiered Access

In the Tiered Access Diagram, only Host A is connected directly to the grid. Hosts B, C, and D are connected only to Host A. In this arrangement, Host A functions as a first-tier system; Hosts B, C, and D function as second-tier systems. Any user who wants to access Hosts B, C, or D must first pass through Host A. To get from Host B to Host C or D, the decker must re-enter Host A.

First-tier systems can be designed to act as switchers, passing authorized users into second-tier hosts. Or first-tier systems may allow users to pass to a private local telecommunications grid (PLTG) that provides access to second-tier systems. The classic Matrix security concept called chokepoint design is a specific application of tiered access. In chokepoint systems, the first-tier hosts carry as vicious security as is possible, with the second-tier hosts running relatively lower security.

#### Host-Host Access

A host-host access configuration consists of a set of hosts linked directly to one another. No single host defends the others. All perform specific jobs but must share data to do so. In Matrix 1.0, such a system would have been mapped as a series of SANs shared by multiple CPUs, or maybe just a lot of SPUs under a powerful CPU.

Host-host configurations commonly appear in corporate schemas. Typically, only a few hosts connect directly to public grids, but numerous machines in the second tier of the system are linked to each other. Deckers can only access hosts through other computers that are linked to them. For example, a decker in the LTG of the system in the Host-Host Diagram would have to pass through Hosts B and D or through Hosts B, C and D to reach Host E.

#### Private Grid Access

A private grid (PLTG) represents a proprietary communications network inhabited solely by the hosts of a given corporation, government, or consortium. These can range from small, local networks called LANs (Local Area Networks) to global PLTGs. Once a decker has accessed any host in a private grid, he can access any other host connected to that grid. Within a PLTG, hosts may be organized In tiered or host-host access configurations-and are. In the Sixth World, paranoia is not a pathology for Matrix-security designers. It's a requirement. For a more detailed description of PLTGs, see the Grids and Hosts section, p. 14.

### SYSTEM RATINGS

The Matrix 1.0 rules forced gamemasters to map out each host in detail, creating different ratings for each system node. In Matrix 2.0, every system, whether a grid or a host, has a Security Rating and five subsystem ratings -- Access, Control, Index, Files and Slave; In Matrix 2.0, these ratings are collectively known as the System Rating (note that this use of the term is completely different from the definition of System Rating in the original Matrix rules). See Grids and Hosts, p. 14, for rules for determining System Ratings.

#### SECURITY RATING

A Security Rating consists of a security code (a color) and a Security Value (a number). (The Security Value is called the System Rating in the SRII rulebook.) The four security codes are Blue (little or no security), Green (average security), Orange (significant security), and Red (high security). Reportedly, some systems contain killer defenses that send their security codes right off the 'official' color scale. Decker slang calls these Ultra-Violet, UV, or black systems. The security environments of UV hosts are qualitatively different from those of other hosts. (See Grids and Hosts, p. 14, for more information on UV hosts.) Generally, Security Values range from 4 to 12, though they sometimes range higher. Double-digit values represent extreme system security. The Security Value indicates the number of dice the gamemaster rolls to oppose a deckers system tests.

#### SUBSYSTEM RATINGS

The five subsystem ratings-Access, Control, Index, Files, and Slave-represent the resistance of a system's subsystems to unauthorized manipulations by a decker. These ratings function as target numbers for all the tests a decker makes when attempting to manipulate the system illegally. For example, an unauthorized decker trying to read files on a system would use his Computer Skill to make an Access Test and a Files Test. The Access Test, made against the system's Access Rating, gets the decker into the host or grid. The Files Test, made against the system's File Rating, enables him to read the files themselves. (See Systems Tests, p. 19, for further information on Systems Tests.) Keep in mind that a high subsystem rating does not impede authorized users from using the subsystem. For example, a high Access Rating does not affect the log-on procedures of authorized users. It simply makes illegal log-on attempts more difficult.

- **Access Rating**: The Access Rating measures a system's resistance to unauthorized access. To access a grid, an unauthorized decker must make a successful Access Test against the grid's Access Rating. To log on to a host without a valid passcode, a decker must make a successful Access Test against the host's Access Rating.
    
- **Control Rating**: The Control Rating measures a system's resistance to unauthorized administrative commands. For example, an unauthorized decker attempting to kick a legitimate user off a host must make a successful Control Test against the host's Control Rating. Generally, successful Control Tests will enable deckers to reprogram a system or defeat its security measures.
    
- **Index Rating**: The Index Rating measures a system's resistance to unauthorized searches. An unauthorized decker searching a grid or host for a system address or specific file must make an Index Test against the grid/host's Index Rating.
    
- **Files Rating**: Deckers must make Files Tests against the Files Ratings whenever they attempt to illegally read or write datafiles in a system. Deckers must also make Files Tests to decrypt encoded files and send output to devices such as faxprinters or chip cookers.
    
- **Slave Rating**: The Slave Rating governs the operation of remote devices controlled by a system. For example, a successful Slave Test enables an unauthorized decker to take control of devices manipulated by a host, such as security cameras and elevators.
    

#### RATING FORMAT

Matrix 2.0 describes System Ratings using the following shorthand format: Security Code-Security Value/Access/Control/Index/Files/Slave

For example, a Red-6 system with Access and Index Ratings of 10, a Control Rating of 12, and Files and Slave Ratings equal to 9 would be written: Red-6/10/12/10/9/9

The acronym "ACIFS-Access Control Index Files Slave-may make remembering this format easier. The gamemaster may also create a simplified format by eliminating the Files and Slave ratings. Generally, Index, Files and Slave Ratings do not differ greatly, so the gamemaster may simply average the three values, rounding fractions down. In this simplified format, the example above would become: Red-6/10/12/9

A System Design Sheet for recording further details of a system appears in the Appendix, p. 156.

### DECK RATINGS

The power of a deckers persona is defined by the processing power of his deck's MPCP (Master Persona Control Program), and his bod, sensor, evasion, and masking utility programs. The MPCP represents the master operating system for the deck and has an MPCP Rating that measures its ability to take damage and continue functioning. The bod, sensor, evasion, and masking programs are called persona programs. The numeric ratings of these programs serve as the 'attributes" for the decker's persona and are used whenever tests are made against the decker while In the Matrix. Deckers also use utility programs, rated in the same manner.

The MPCP Rating is the central value for cyberdecks. The MPCP Rating multiplied by 3 equals the maximum total of the deck's persona programs. No single Persona Rating may exceed the MPCP Rating, and the maximum value for most utility programs is equal to the MPCP Rating.

The shorthand format for describing a cyberdeck's ratings is: MPCP Rating/Bod Rating/Evasion Rating/Masking Rating/Sensor Rating

A deck with MPCP-8 and all Persona programs distributed equally among the maximum total (3 x 8 = 24), would be written as follows: MPCP-8/6/6/6/6

If the decker increased his Bod Rating by 2 points, to the maximum of 8, he'd have to reduce the other Persona programs by a total of 2. If he decided to reduce his Evasion and Sensor ratings by 1 each, the deck's ratings would be written MPCP-8/8/5/6/5

All of these programs are discussed in more detail in the Deckers, Cyberdecks, and Programs sections.

#### DETECTION FACTOR

The gamemaster uses the decker's Detection Factor as the target number when making tests to detect a decker's presence or prevent a decker from performing actions within the Matrix (see System Tests, p. 19). To determine the decker's Detection Factor, calculate the average (round up) of the decker's Masking Rating and Sleaze program rating. For example, an MPCP-8/6/8/6/4 deck, running a Sleaze-8 program, would have a Detection Factor of 7. That's [6 (Masking) + 8 (Sleaze Rating)] divided by 2 = 7. If a decker is not running a Sleaze program, the Detection Factor equals half the Masking Rating. This makes a drek-hot Sleaze program a necessity for any decker with aspirations, not to mention a keen sense of self-preservation.

### THE HACKING POOL

The Matrix 2.0 system creates a much smaller Hacking Pool than Matrix 1.0. To determine a deckers Matrix 2:0 Hacking Pool, add the deckers Intelligence Rating and his deck's MPCP Rating, divide the total by 3 and round down. (Any increases of a decker's Intelligence apply to his Hacking Pool as well, whether they come from cyberware or magic. Increases are cumulative unless the gamemaster chooses to use the optional Multiple Improvements rule provided on p. 19.) The final figure is the Matrix 2.0 Hacking Pool.

Generally, Hacking Pool dice may be added to any test made In the Matrix-System Tests, attack of defense tests, maneuvers, programming, or attribute tests. However, characters may not use Hacking Pool dice in the following circumstances: First, dice from the Hacking Pool cannot enhance Initiative rolls or doctrinal dice rolls such as 'roll ID6 to see how long it will be before the host crashes." Those are not tests In the Shadowrun sense of a dice roll against a target number. Additionally, Hacking Pool dice cannot be used in Body of Willpower tests made to resist the effects of gray or black IC that Is damaging the decker. Only Karma Pool dice, enhancements connected to the cyberdeck, or bloware/magic boosts to the decker's Body or Willpower can help In such situations.

#### Cyberware and the Pool

Any cybertech item from Shadowrun, Second Edition; Shadowtech; or Cybertechnology that raises Intelligence may affect the Hacking Pool, as noted above. Two specific examples of such Items: often employed by wiz deckers, require special comment. These are encephalon implants and the Math SPU (see Shadowtech, pp. 49 and 52). Encephalon implants improve Intelligence, and this bonus figures into the calculation of the Hacking Pool. In addition, encephalons provide Task Pool dice for certain activities. If the decker has slotted a Computer skillsoft with a rating equal to or greater than his own skill, or if he only uses the skill granted by the skillsoft, the Task Pool dice also go into the Hacking Pool. Note that skillwires are not required to use a Computer activesoft for decking if the decker uses an encephalon implant. However, skillwires are required to use the skillsoft without an encephalon implant. A Math SPU increases a character's Intelligence by half its rating for purposes of decking. For example, a Math SPU of Rating 4 offers a substantial bonus to the decker's Hacking Pool, especially if he does not have a million nuyen to buy components to build a drek-hot cyberdeck. For 23,000 nuyen and a trifling Essence cost, it represents an excellent investment.

#### Optional Rule: Multiple Improvements

The optional multiple improvements rule may be used to prevent players from using magical and cybernetic Intelligence bonuses to produce 'superdecker' characters who possess excessive Hacking Pools. Under this rule, the character may apply only one Intelligence bonus to the Hacking Pool. Use the highest bonus or allow the player to choose which enhancement applies to the pool. Generally, an encephalon Implant represents the best choice, because its Task Pool dice directly enhance the Hacking Pool. The multiple improvements rule prevents players from creating superdeckers who buy every last advantage they can get in cyberware and have a friendly mage with that Increase Attribute spell constantly on tap. It forces the decker to get his extra edge from superior decks and utilities, which will result in characters who are extremely hungry for cash, especially if the gamemaster employs the SOTA rules (see Deckers, p. 74). This need for cash also provides a weakness gamemasters may exploit when luring players into scripted adventures.

### SYSTEM TESTS

As noted in the section Introduction, unauthorized deckers must make System Tests whenever they attempt to perform tasks within the Matrix. System Tests are always resolved as opposed tests between the decker and the target host/grid. The decker uses his Computing skill to make the Subsystem Test appropriate to the task he is attempting. For example, logging on to a host requires an Access Test against the system's Access Rating. Editing a file on that host requires a Files Test, and so on. The target number for these tests is modified by any utility programs the decker is running and any appropriate situation modifiers (system alert levels, damaged decker or deck, and so on).

For the opposed test, the gamemaster rolls the host/grid's Security Value (on a Red-6 host, that would be 6 dice) against the decker's Detection Factor. Apply any appropriate situation modifiers to the Detection Factor. The following example illustrates the first step any decker is going to take; getting into the host within which he wants to operate.

HeadCrash has Computing-6 and an MPCP-8/6/6/6/6 deck. He is running Sleaze-5, so his Detection Factor is 6 (6 + 5 = 11, divided by 2 = 5.5, rounded up). He is also running Deception-4. Head is decking into a Red-8 host with Access-11. He needs to make an Access Test to log on. HeadCrash rolls 6 dice, his Computing skill. The target number is: 11 (Access Rating) minus 4 (Deception Rating), for a final Access Test Target Number of 7.

The gamemaster rolls 8 dice, the host's Security Value, against a Target Number 6, Head's Detection Factor. HeadCrash achieves results of 2,2,3,4,5,9, for one success against the Target Number of 7. The host achieves results of 1,2,2,2,3,3,5,5-no successes. HeadCrash logs on to the host. He got lucky, and he'd better hope his luck holds. Note that had HeadCrash not been running the Deception program, his Target Number would have been 11 rather than 7. He'd have had no successes, and would have failed to log on. Moral: you can't do anything unless you can get into a host in the first place, so a good Deception program is a must for any decker interested in hosts with high security levels.

If the decker achieves more successes than the host, he wins the test and succeeds at whatever task he is attempting to perform. If the host achieves more successes, the decker fails. Regardless of the test outcome, the gamemaster records the host's number of successes and adds the total to any previous successes the host achieved in System Tests against the decker. This running total creates the security tally.

#### SECURITY TALLY

The gamemaster tallies all the successes a host/grid achieves while opposing a decker in System Tests. This tally runs as long as the decker is logged on to that particular host/grid. When the tally reaches a level set by the gamemaster, It may trigger actions within the host/grid, determined by the gamemaster and ranging from the activation of black IC programs to nothing at all. The bottom line is that decker never knows what will happen as a result of his next test, or how many more tests he can safely afford before the host/grid catches on to his presence and does its best to crash him. More details on security tallies and how to use them appear In the gamemaster-only section Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149. The system sheaves (archetypes for a Matrix system) provided in that section define the reaction of a host/grid to intruders: slow and cautious, or fast and lethal.

\> -Laughing Man (77:77:77/12-24-56)

\> (But at what cost? These kids don't know who Blake was. They think a glacier'is a node loaded with IC. They've never traversed one on a mountainside. If they even knew what glaciers really were, they'd figure someone was crazy for climbing one. The metaphor has turned into a real thing in their world, the virtual world. They could care less what the word means in the meatworld they sneer at.)

\> -Laughing Man (27 :??: 77/12-24-56)

But from that strength comes beauty, sometimes even peace. Cind can rip out a computer core like a tigress, but most of her spare cred goes to upgrading the synths she plays via Matrix at her concerts. Without that strength, would she have learned to make music like a goddess?)

### GRIDS

The term grid is often used as a synonym for the Matrix, but in Matrix 2.0 the term denotes a telecommunications net-in other words, the phone company. The situation in 2056 can be traced back to the years following the Crash of 29, when most developed nations returned to massive, single-vendor monopolies for their common-carrier communications. This arrangement was intended to prevent another Crash, of course, not to satisfy the demands of the megacorps, control citizens' access to data, or anything like that. National grids consist of one or more Regional Telecommunications Grids (RTG), owned and maintained by a monopoly vendor. An RTG usually encompasses many dependent Local Telecommunications Grids (LTG). LTGs are analogous to the area codes of 20th-century communication networks and are maintained by local subsidiaries or franchises of the parent company.

#### REGIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION GRIDS [RTG]

The topology of the North American RTGs appears on p. 164, SRII. The Matrix 2.0 System Ratings for these RTGs are listed In the North American RTG System Ratings table. The Overseas RTG System Ratings table provides Matrix 2.0 System Ratings for overseas RTGs. Because public grids carry such enormous volumes of traffic and possess relatively few security resources, these ratings are lower than those of a typical host computer. When generating System Ratings for a public grid not on the list, assume the grid has an Intrusion Difficulty of Easy and subtract 2 from all ratings (for a range of 6 to 8). See Intrusion Difficulty, p. 31, for details on generating ratings. To minimize the impact of the Matrix 2.0 upgrade on previously published Shadowrun materials, the grids retain their original Security Ratings.

*Denotes an entry point to a PLTG (see below).

#### LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS GRIDS [LTG]

When a decker first connects to the public grid at the start of a run, his deck loads his icon onto an LTG. LTG ratings, at least in North America, are usually equal to the System Ratings for the parent RTG. In countries like Germany, however, the System Ratings of LTGs and their parent RTGs may vary.

##### Optional Rule: Variable LTG Ratings

Gamemasters may vary an LTG's System Ratings to simulate the constant system-load fluctuations, rerouting, and alerts common to LTGs. At the gamemaster's discretion, fluctuations may affect specific locations in an LTG or the entire LTG and may last for a few hours or the length of an entire adventure. To determine the ratings of a fluctuating LTG, roll 1D6. On a result of 1 or 2, reduce all the LTG's basic System Ratings by 1. On a 3 or 4, the basic ratings remain unchanged. On a result of 5 or 6, increase the LTG's System Ratings by 1. The gamemaster may also implement specific changes in the System Ratings of an LTG to reflect specific events or to accommodate the background of an adventure.

#### PRIVATE LTGS

Private LTGs (PLTGs), as described on p. 169, SRII, actually represent independent, restricted global grids that are closed to the general public. Most large corporations and all megacorporations maintain at least one PLTG. Typically, most developed countries maintain several government PLTGs, which may extend to military or diplomatic sites outside the countries' borders.

PLTGs are governed by the laws of the corp or country that owns them. As a result, PLTG owners can install any anti-intrusion measures they desire. Because building a PLTG requires a considerable investment, most owners don't skimp on the IC. PLTGs are stable systems and their System Ratings do not vary. When assigning System Ratings to a custom-designed PLTG, the gamemaster should consider using Orange or Red security codes and Intrusion Difficulties of Easy, as described in Intrusion Difficulty, p. 31. System Ratings for several sample PLTGs appear in Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149.

##### Entry Points

Corporate PLTGs span the globe. An LTG code like NA/LICAS-NE-3617-EBMMHQ, referred to in the basic Shadowrun rules, actually identifies a single entry point on the EBMZ PLTG, a grid that connects corporate host computers all over the world. PTLGs may support multiple entry points connecting them to different public grids. Saeder-Krupp's PLIG, for example, has an entry point on the Rhine-Ruhr RTG in Germany (D03-11), and a North American entry in New York (NA/UCAS-NE-4212-SKRLIPP). Both have a System Rating of Red-5/8/10/9/10/10, because they are actually parts of the same system. Deckers may gain access to a PLTG through any of its entry points, or by entering a host connected to the PLIG.

##### Regulations

Many countries strictly regulate the operation of PLTGs within their public grids, despite corporate pressure to deregulate all international PLTG access. In North America, the Pueblo and Ute Councils, the Sioux Nation, Tir Tairngire, and Aztlan all maintain anti-PLTG regulations. Overseas, PLTGs are regulated or forbidden in Tir na nOg, Israel, Japan, the Confederated Azanian Nations (outside of the Trans-Swazi Federation), some of the other, stronger African states, and some of the single-vendor ministates that virtually belong to one of the megacorps. The Pueblo, Sioux, and Israelis maintain tight control over all data traffic into and out of their countries as a matter of course and outlaw all PLTGs. The Utes prohibit PLTGs because they regard technological intrusions Into their sovereignty as a threat to the old ways. The two Tirs are so paranoid about secrecy that their principal motive remains anybody's guess.

In general, PLTG regulations are politically motivated and inconsistent. For example, in countries where megacorps effectively own the government, these megacorps reserve the right to operate their own PLTGs while denying others the same right. Similarly, Japan allows Japanese-owned corporations PLTG access but denies it to foreign corps. And is anyone surprised to know that Aztechnology's PLTG is the only corporate PLTG that operates freely in Aztlan?

### JACKPOINTS

Jackpoints consist of the physical connections deckers use to access the Matrix. Each type of jackpoint has three values-Trace, Access, and Base Bandwidth.

The Trace Factor Indicates the traceability of a jackpoint. The lower the Trace Factor, the more easily Trace IC (see p. 45) can locate the jackpoint. The Trace Factor applies for the decker's entire run. The jackpoint's Access modifier applies to all the decker's Access Tests during the run. The base bandwidth value represents the maximum bandwidth the jackpoint accepts without further reducing its Trace Factor (see Cyberdecks, p. 81, for a description of the optional bandwidth rules). If the decker's bandwidth exceeds the jackpoint's base bandwidth, use the following formula to calculate the bandwidth Trace modifier. First, divide the decker's bandwidth by the base bandwidth and round the result down. Multiply that figure by -1. The result is the bandwidth Trace modifier. For example, a decker with 78 Mp on a jackpoint with a Base Bandwidth of 20 has an additional Trace modifier of -3 (78 divided by 20 equals 3.9, rounded down to 3 and multiplied by -1). The bandwidth Trace modifier may change during the run as the I/O bandwidth is increased or reduced, but it may never drop below the modifier for the decker's icon bandwidth, because that value is fixed for the entire Matrix run. Gamemasters may vary the base bandwidth of jackpoints available at specific locations. For example, jackpoints at a cheap hacker hotel that provides stolen trid connections might have base bandwidths of 10 Mp. Meanwhile, the optical trunks serving an office or condo complex might have base bandwidths of 40 or 50 Mp.

The following text describes the vital statistics of common jackpoints.

- **Legal Access**:
    
    - Trace Factor: -2
        
    - Access: -2
        
    - Base Bandwidth: 20
        
    - A legal-access jackpoint represents access from a legally registered tridphone. Of course, it doesn't have to be your tridphone, omae.
        
- **Illegal Access**:
    
    - Trace Factor: +0
        
    - Access: +0
        
    - Base Bandwidth: 20
        
    - An illegal-access jackpoint represents access from either an illegal tricphone connection (some unscrupulous soul has boosted service from the phone company) or a tap, an illegal junction box hooked directly into a fiber-optic trunk. The illegal-access jackpoint is the most common jackpoint used by deckers.
        
- **Satellite Uplink**:
    
    - Trace Factor: See p. 30
        
    - Access: +2
        
    - Base Bandwidth: 50
        
    - The satellite uplink jackpoint is described in detail under Satellite Links, p. 30.
        
- **Workstation**:
    
    - Trace Factor: -4
        
    - Access: -4
        
    - Base Bandwidth: 50
        
    - Workstations consist of cyberterminals connected directly to a host. Naturally, the decker is not jacked into the wimped-out terminal that the company provides but is running his own deck over the same commline. Trace programs can spot these In a hot tick, but they're cheese to break into.
        
- **Remote Device**:
    
    - Trace Factor: +4
        
    - Access: +4
        
    - Base Bandwidth: 20
        
    - Remote devices provide the means for the classic, sneaky, back-door intrusion. The targeted host mounts grid defenses that don't quit, and big goons with bigger guns guard the office terminals, But the system runs a remote-controlled device-an automated factory, à security terminal, even a vending machine-that lets the decker slip his icon past all the gonzo IC and straight into the guts of the system. Remote devices are a bit harder to trace than most jackpoints because most IC searches for commlines initially and does not start interrogating other input sources until it comes up empty on the SANs. However, a decker will have to sweat to defeat the remote device's Access codes because most systems are not set up to take orders from a soda machine.
        
- **Console Access**:
    
    - Trace Factor: -6
        
    - Access: See text
        
    - Base Bandwidth: Unlimited
        
    - A console can be the actual control panel on a mainframe, or a workstation logged on with console access. Console access Is also called supervisor, super-user, or sysop access. Trace IC can locate a console-access jackpoint very easily, but such jackpoints provide easy access to a decker. For deckers attempting to access a system via a console-access jackpoint, halve the opposing system's Access Rating and Security Value for all Access Tests. Additionally, the decker can use all the bandwidth he wants without lowering the jackpoint's Trace Factor. However, gaining console access requires a really wiz ground team of runners to get the decker into the machine room and keep him alive long enough to do the biz.
        

#### GRID SECURITY TALLIES

Switching LTGs within the same the same RTG does not affect the security tally against a decker. For example, If a decker logs on to UCAS-SEA-2206 and incurs a tally of 2, then logs on to the UCAS-SEA RTG central system and picks up another point to his tally, then finally accesses UCAS-SEA-4206 and picks up another 2 points, his Security Tally stands at 5 and stays at 5 for as long as he is logged on to the UCAS-SEA grids. However, the tally does not follow the decker if he logs on to another RTG.

##### PLTGs and Security Talles

Because PLTGs maintain very active security routines, a security tally built up under a given RTG does remain in force if the decker logs on to a PLTG from the RTG. This occurs because PLTGs pick up security "flags" from RTGs when they acknowledge log-ons. This means that a decker who racks up a big tally working his way through the public grids may trigger IC as soon as he enters private dataspace. The decker in our example, with a Security Tally of 5, would retain that tally when he enters a PLTG from the RTG. If that tally Is enough to trigger security responses in the PLTG, they go off as soon as he finishes the log-on. Whatever the immediate result, his Security Tally on the PLTG begins at 5, plus any points he incurs while logging on.

### SYSTEM OPERATIONS ON GRIDS

In addition to the following System Operations, deckers can always perform a Graceful Logoff operation at any time. For an explanation of Graceful Logoffs and other System Operations, see System Operations, p. 108.

- **from a Jackpoint**: Deckers jacking in via legal or illegal trid can only perform the Logon to LTG operation. Then they have to find the host/grid they want to invade, if they don't know its location. Deckers jacking in via a dedicated workstation, slave-controlled remote device, or console can only perform the Logon to Host operation and must log on to the host that controls the gizmo they are using for access.
    
- **On an LTG**: Once logged on to an LTG, the decker can move to the parent RTG with a Logon to RTG operation or try to access any host connected to the LTG with a Logon to Host operation. If a PLTG is attached to the LTG the decker is on, he can use a Logon to LTG to try to break into it. The decker can also attempt Redirect Datatrail and Retrain operations from an LTG. When the decker enters a PLTG, remember that any security tally built up in previous tests on the RTG and its LTGs follows the character and can trigger immediate problems for the decker.
    
- **On an RTG**: Once logged on to an RTG, the decker can either move to another RTG (i.e., make a "long-distance call" to get on to the Grid in another part of the world) by using a Logon to RTG operation or enter any LTG attached to the RTG with a Logon to LTG operation. The character may also perform the following operations on an RTG: Locate Access Node, Make Comcall, Redirect Datatrail, Retrain, Tap Comcall.
    
- **On a PLIG**: A decker logged on to a PLTG may perform any System Operation available on public RTGs and LTGs.
    

### SATELLITE LINKS

When a decker taps directly into a communications satellite to enter the Matrix, he trades higher Access target numbers for partial immunity to Trace IC. Signal lag over the satlink also reduces Reaction by -2. While Trace IC can locate the satellite jackpoint, it cannot pinpoint the decker's physical location, making physical response to the Matrix intrusion Impossible. The other effects of a successful trace still apply (see Trace IC. p. 45). To access the Matrix via a satellite, a decker must have a deck equipped with a satlink interface (sec Cyberdecks, p. 81). The satlink software enables the decker to locate a commsat. The Base Time to isolate the satellite and lock onto its transponder is 3 minutes. To do so, the decker must make a successful Computer Test against a target number based on the conditions of the attempt, as shown on the Satlink Target Numbers Table. Failure to achieve any successes means that the decker fails to locate the satellite or lock on to its transponder. As a rule of thumb, the gamemaster can allow the character to make another attempt after five minutes or so, and more frequently in dire situations.

#### SATLINK TARGET NUMBERS TABLE

| Conditions                              | Target Number |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Open country, clear view of horizon     | 2             |
| Open country, some obstructions         | 3             |
| Open country, mountains or heavy forest | 6             |
| Suburban                                | 3             |
| Light Urban                             | 6             |
| Downtown Urban                          | 8             |
| Bad weather (more than overcast)        | +2            |
#### Decking the Satellite

For game purposes, satellites function as LTGs but are classified as Orange-Average or even Orange-Hard systems with no reduction in Subsystem Ratings. Rate military and private corporate comsats as Red-Hard. Once the decker locates the satellite, he can perform a Logon to I.TG operation to access it. From the satellite, a decker can perform a Logon to RTG operation to any RTG on earth. He can access most systems in near-earth orbit as well, if they use that particular satellite for communications. In case any suicidal deckers ask, no, Zurich-Orbital does not use satellite protocols this way, so this trick is not an effective back door into that most icy of Matrix domains. Security tallies generated on a satellite carry over to the RTG that the decker accesses.

### HOSTS

Host systems serve as the computer installations where the Sixth World processes all its information. Billions of nuyen and Inestimable megapulses of data flow through these systems daily. Host systems act as the vaults where secrets are stashed-the technological wonders of hundreds of R& D departments, the hidden dirt of the gleaming corporate world, secret identities and true names.

#### SECURITY CODES

The security code of a host measures the level of security precautions the host maintains. Generally, the code reflects the sensitivity of the data on the host, but it may also simply reflect the degree of paranoia suffered by the host's owner.

- **Blue Hosts**: Blue hosts include most public-service databases: newsfax distribution systems, public library databases, directories of listed commcodes-pretty much anything free, whether provided by a government, a corp, or a private individual. Small businesses too poor to secure their systems tend to have Blue hosts as well. Every snot-nosed Matrix wannabe with a cheap deck and time on his hands targets Blue systems. As a result, these systems usually carry a fair share of Matrix graffiti: virus code that displays obscene "wit" when a user logs on, datastores fragmented by random vandalism, amateurish icons that simply sit in memory being obnoxious. The "protection" programs commonly Imposed on Blue systems are a bit nastier. These smartframes will gut system files if the netpunks don't get their weekly "donation" from the system owner.
    
- **Green Hosts**: Green hosts are average systems, but never make the mistake of thinking a Green host represents easy prey. They may be more patient with intruders than the Orange or Red systems, but they can load any IC the hotter hosts mount. Green hosts include public databases that charge minimal user fees, open computer nets at colleges (though not the ones used by corp-funded research projects), and corporate and government computers that run the day-to-day office work.
    
- **Orange Hosts**: Orange hosts pride themselves on being secure systems, if not wild-eyed killer hosts. Orange hosts store your standard "secret" data and carry out processing that is Important but not absolutely essential to the host's operators. Orange systems Include the typical factory controller and the networks used by middle management in a typical corporate office.
    
- **Red Hosts**: Red hosts offer the most security that a system may legally carry. They contain "top secret" data, often the kind owners will kill to protect, and mission-critical process controls (life support, vital labs and factories, power grids, and the like). Anti-intrusion defenses tend to be lethal-deckers get no "warning shots" on Red systems.
    

#### INTRUSION DIFFICULTY

The System Ratings of a host-the Security Value and Subsystem Ratings-are based on a measurement called Intrusion Difficulty. Matrix 2.0 rares systems with Intrusion Difficulties of Easy, Average, or Hard. Generally, Intrusion Difficulty is based on the level of "user-friendliness" that the system must have to do its job, and the number of users who access the host on a typical day.

- **Easy Systems**: Generally. Easy systems share their functions among many different users and offices. These systems handle high volumes of traffic and accommodate many demands on their computing power. As a result, these hosts can devote only meager resources to security. Typical Easy systems include highly centralized corporate computers, educational systems, and cheap systems installed by small businesses.
    
- **Average Systems**: Generally, Average systems support smaller user-bases than Easy systems, and they handle more limited and secure transactions. Typical Average corporate systems serve a single office or division, often with a user-base limited to executives and their Immediate staff. Prosperous small companies also use Average systems, as would R&D projects dealing with less-than-earthshaking research.
    
- **Hard Systems**: Hard systems handle the most secure data and restrict access to a favored few users. Typical Hard systems include financial transfer systems, major R&D facilities, private corporate executive networks, secure military systems, virtually all intelligence systems, and critical public systems like air traffic control or municipal power.
    

### SYSTEM RATINGS

The gamemaster sets host System Ratings based on the host's Intrusion Difficulty. The gamemaster may use dice rolls or his discretion to create these ratings.

#### Random Generation

To ser System Ratings randomly: the gamemaster simply rolls the dice indicated on the Random Host System-Rating Table. (1D3 equals ID6 divided by 2.) The information on the table assumes that an "average" decker possesses utilities with a Rating of 4. As a result, using the table may produce System Ratings that present little challenge for deckers with significantly higher utility ratings. In such cases, gamemasters may wish to generate System Ratings using the Assigned Numbers method (see below).

##### RANDOM HOST SYSTEM-RATING TABLE

|Intrusion Difficulty|Security Value|Subsystem Ratings|
|---|---|---|
|Easy|1D3 + 3|1D3 + 7|
|Average|1D3 + 6|2D3 + 9|
|Hard|2D3 + 6|1D6 + 12|
The gamemaster is designing a host that holds key evidence of corporate double-dealing. He decides it is a computer serving a regional office of Aztechnology. It carries sensitive data, and AZT is notoriously paranoid about deckers, so he gives it a Security Code of Red. However, the system must serve a moderately large user base efficiently, so he determines that it is an Average system.

The gamemaster rolls 1D6 for the Security Value. The dice roll produces a 3, which the gamemaster divides by 2 and rounds up for a result of 2. That yields a final Security Value of 8 (6 + 2). Now he rolls five times for the Subsystem Ratings. On an Average host, the dice roll is 2D3 + 9. His rolls produce results of 11, 15, 13, 13, 12. The final System Ratings for the AZT host are:

- **Security**: Red-8
    
- **Access**: 11
    
- **Control**: 15
    
- **Index**: 13
    
- **Files**: 13
    
- **Slave**: 12
    

or Red-8/11/15/13/13/12. Terrifying for a beginning decker with Computer-6 and a cheap deck. Cheese for a scarred veteran of the Matrix punching a Fairlight's console. Should give pause for thought to the 99 percent of deckers who fit somewhere in between.

#### Assigned numbers

The gamemaster can simply assign values to the host's System Ratings as follows, enabling him to create challenging hosts based on a specific decker's resources.

- **Easy**: Security Value 4 to 6, Subsystem Ratings 8 to 10
    
- **Average**: Security Value 7 to 9, Subsystem Ratings 11 to 15
    
- **Hard**: Security Value 8 to 12, Subsystem Ratings 13 to 18
    

Regardless of how the gamemaster sets the System Ratings, however, he can always tweak a rating up or down to better match the abilities of the player characters. The gamemaster also should ensure that all ratings match the fictional systems they represent. A system in Fuchi's Chiba network, for example, should be a tough nut to crack, and its System Ratings should reflect that degree of difficulty. A player character lacking excellent skills and hot utilities should have less than no hope of defeating such a system. Use the following general guidelines for setting ratings.

- A final Target Number of 3 or less is cheese. A typical starting player character with Computer-6 and a decent Detection Factor to keep the IC off his neck will defeat such ratings most of the time, especially If they are defended by a wimpy 4 or 5 points of security. An Average system will provide stiff opposition for a decker with these ratings. A Hard system will probably defeat such a decker unless he is very lucky.
    
- Deckers with skill of 8 or more, Detection Factors of 8 or 9, and utilities in the 8-point or higher range find Hard systems challenging but defeatable.
    

##### Optional Rule: Varying Subsystem Ratings

Gamemasters may raise or lower individual Subsystem Ratings of hosts to give these systems distinct flavors. For example, if the gamemaster wants to make it difficult for a decker to access an Easy system but encourage a more innovative approach involving a meatworld raid on a corp site, he might increase the Access Rating by 2 for entry points on public grids and reduce the Access Rating by 1 for a dedicated workstation or remote device, altering the Access modifiers from those jackpoints as well.

Similarly, the gamemaster might vary the Files Ratings of a host. For example, he might decide that all of a system's public-relations files, the advertising brochures of the information age, carry a Files Rating 2 points lower than the system's base Files Rating. At the same time, the system's personnel management files, including all e-mail and personal journals, schedules, and so on, have a Files Rating 2 points higher than the system's base Files Rating.

### SYSTEM TRICKS

Though the System Operations section (p. 108) describes the majority of host system operations, the following system tricks appear here because they can be viewed as "meta-operations," operations that affect the entire environment in which deckers and programs operate. The "bouncer" host offers an excellent example of such a meta-operation.

#### Bouncers

A bouncer host operates at an apparently low level of security but upgrades its Security Rating when it detects intrusion. For example, in its normal state a host may carry Orange or Green security. When the security tally reaches a specific point, usually after a fairly low number of tests, the mainframe actually loads in new security code and changes into a Red system with a higher Security Value. If a decker logs on and runs an Analyze Host diagnostic operation, he will determine that he is entering a Green-4 host. Null sweat. He goes about his business until he triggers the bouncer. On the next turn, the system turns into a Red-8 host!

A bouncer takes 1 turn to make the upgrade. Whenever a decker triggers a bouncer, the gamemaster makes a Sensor (Security Value) Test, using the system's original Security Value. If the test results in any successes, the decker notices that the Security Rating is rising but must perform an Analyze Host operation to determine the new security code and value. The decker makes the test for this operation against the new Security Rating. If he fails to achieve any successes, the decker must perform another Analyze Host operation to find out why the computer has suddenly become so hostile. (See p. 111 for a description of the Analyze Host operation.)

Highly secure areas of a specific host also may function as bouncers automatically, regardless of the security tally. For example, any operations on top-secret R&D datafiles might trigger a bouncer as soon as the host achieves a single success against a user. Even legitimate users opening these files may trigger higher security, just as an authorized bank employee opening a vault may trigger alarm klaxons and flashing lights.

#### Chokepoints

A chokepoint host exists solely to block unauthorized access to more sensitive computers. Traditionally, these hosts serve systems that are linked together so that users must pass through the chokepoint host to reach other hosts in the system. Chokepoints generally protect sensitive hosts that must maintain constant Matrix access, such as financial management, air-traffic control, and power-grid management systems. The chokepoint usually has higher System Ratings than the host it protects, especially chokepoints guarding high-volume systems that normally offer Easy or Average Intrusion Difficulties. The "killing jar" architecture found at the Denver datahaven represents one of the ultimate developments of chokepoint design (see p. 79, Denver, The City of Shadows). Rumor claims that the engineers there have dedicated a massively parallel ultramini to run the murderous IC in this design. Certainly it takes something at least that powerful to make the chokepoint as impassable as it seems.

Chokepoints can be stoppers on Matrix runs. A decker can try to bull through with brute force and hot programs, but this approach can prove a real gamble. The smartest approach is to locate alternate access paths to the target host that allow the decker to bypass the chokepoint host altogether. Figure 1 In the Chokepoint Designs diagram shows a simple chokepoint design. The only way into the target host is through the Red host that connects the system to the LTG. Unless the decker bypasses the grid altogether and gains access to a workstation, slave remote, or similar jackpoint, he must tackle the Red-8 monster to get to the goodies on the Orange-6 host. Actually, such arrangements are rare on all but the most sensitive systems, because few operators can afford to tie up so many resources behind impassable security. Figure 2 shows a much more common configuration. Here, a nasty chokepoint blocks public access to the target host, but a decker can sidestep it via the corporate PLTG and a cheesy office LAN with a dedicated connection to the target.

#### Trap Doors

Trap doors offer "secret passages" from one host to another or to a PLTG. A host may appear to be isolated from the Matrix but have a comm port that is not accessible via its Access routines, Instead, some other subsystem controls passage to the target host. For example, the Shiseki-gumo, a yakuza clan, hides its main computer behind a trap door on an Innocuous Green-5 business computer belonging to Tri-Marine Exports. An Analyze Subsystem operation that examines the Access subsystem finds nothing unusual. Analyzing the Slave subsystem, however, reveals a dedicated port connected directly to another host. The decker must perform a Graceful Logoff using the Subsystem Rating that conceals the trap door before he can Logon to Host to reach the host to which it leads. For example, on the Tri-Marine computer, the decker must make a successful Slave Test to get out through the trap door, then an Access Test to get into the Shiseki computer on the "other side." (See pp. 114, 116, for descriptions of Graceful Logoff and Logon to Host operations.)

Trap doors are particularly nasty when combined with chokepoints. To defeat such arrangements, the decker must bit-flip around in the very hostile environment of the chokepoint host, looking for the trap door that leads to the goodies.

#### Vanishing SANs

Vanishing SANS (System Access Nodes) represent entry points on an LTG or PLTG active only at specific times. At all other times, these SANs are closed and do not even appear in the RTG! They simply do not exist except when active. A decker performing a Locate Access Node operation when a vanishing SAN is open will find it. A second later, when the SAN closes, he will not. Very sensitive systems that must maintain realtime Matrix access to perform their functions may use all sorts of variations on this trick.

To log on to a system via a vanishing SAN, the decker must wait until the SAN becomes active and then succeed in a Logon to Host operation before it disappears again. If the operation succeeds, the decker has jammed open the SAN and set up spoof code that makes the host think its access node is safely offline again. If the operation fails before the SAN disappears, the system dumps the decker. Typically, vanishing SANs stay open for no more than 10 to 20 seconds. For a typical vanishing SAN, the gamemaster rolls 1D6 + 1. The result is the number of turns the decker may try to log on.

Vanishing SANs include timed, teleporting, and triggered SANs.

- **Timed SANs** are the simplest form of vanishing SANs. A timed SAN always uses the same LTG code and opens at set times each day. The Blological Library computer at MIT&M, for example, opens a connection to the LTG every day at 0600, 1200, and 1800 Eastern time to share e-mail, abstracts, and other traffic with the rest of the Matrix. A decker who wants to access this host from the grid must be waiting at one of those times and then must sneak past the Access protection to get online before the transfers end.
    
- **Teleporting SANs** generally belong only to major megacorps and governments with the wealth and clout to broker the necessary contracts with the RTG vendors. Each time a teleporting SAN disappears, it cancels its account on the RTG and subscribes to an entirely different RTG for its next appearance. This trick is analogous to having an unlisted comm number that changes your comm code, AND your area code, AND your country code, after every call. Saeder-Krupp Prime division operates a wandering node that uses this trick. It can open Matrix access at 09:00:01 GMT on a German LTG, close at 09:00:07 and re-open at 09:01:01 with an LTG address under a UCAS RTG. Now you see it, now you-hey, where th frag did it go ?! Teleporting SANs switch their network addresses based on secret algorithms. Systems that provide access to SANs also store this algorithm, so that they know where to reach the SAN at any given time. Say Saeder-Krupp Aerospace needs to deliver a report to S-K Prime's teleporting SAN. It "looks at its watch" (I.e., the computer takes the clock tick), feeds it into a "black box" routine, and voila-a comm code and an access time comes out (seems Prime is on a Japanese LTG this morning). Connecting to that code at that time will allow the call to go through. A teleporting SAN intended for outgoing connections only needs no external algorithm at all. The host can even negotiate new node addresses based on an entirely random process, picking RTGs out of the thin, virtual air of the Matrix. To jump a teleporting SAN, a decker must possess the SAN's algorithm code so that he can predict the SAN's whereabouts. Alternatively, the decker can run a frame with an Event Trigger (see p. 107) that performs periodic Search RTG operations to monitor selected RTGs and notifies him when the new SAN appears in the lookup tables. For one-time runs, an employer or some other asset may provide a decker with the coordinates of a vanishing SAN. The slang term "Port-a-SANs" applied to teleporting SANs is a regrettable indication of the maturity level of certain deckers, and the present author assumes no responsibility for it.
    
- **Triggered SANs** are access nodes that open only in response to specific actions elsewhere in the Matrix. For example, the R&D host for Yamatetsu's gene-tech center only opens when a Slave operation on the Yamatetsu-North America HQ processor triggers a satellite signal (non-data bandwidth, useless for decking). The Slave operation, in turn, is triggered by hits on a periodic database search by the HQ machine that finds an update in one of the scientific exchange conversations that the program monitors for the wizkids in research. The Slave node itself lives on a secured system hiding behind a glacier, but the publications monitor runs on a box hooked into the moderately secure Neurobionics Forum network. Couple this scheme with teleporting SAN architecture, and predicting where or when the R&D SAN will open becomes impossible. To do so, a decker would have to know how the triggers work, locate the next address for the SAN, then compromise the event triggers somehow (plant a false hit in the Neurobionics Forum that Yamatetsu's program will want to deliver, or get into the Yamatetsu HQ computer and trigger the signal to the R&D host, or Invade the satellite link and send a false signal that the R& D host accepts as legit) and then be ready to jump the access node when it opens. For a variation on triggered SAN architecture, see the wildly paranoid design of the uplinks to Zurich-Orbital, described on p. 94. Corporate Shadowfiles.
    

#### Virtual Machines

A virtual machine (VM) is a simulated host run as a subprogram by the real host, sometimes called the native host. System operations on the VM do not affect the actual host operations, For example, editing a file on a VM does not alter the actual storage in the native host's datastores. Furthermore, VMs can filter any sensitive data out of downloaded files automatically, before the data even gets into the VM processing area. The decker cannot even recognize that he is getting watered-down information unless he monitors the file as it downloads and knows, based on some other source of knowledge, that the data is incomplete or false. Decryption simply does not work at all.

Nothing a decker does to a VM affects the native computer. Even crashing or throttling the VM host simply alters the way the VM program runs-it will not do a thing to the native host. Frames, virus code, logic bombs-all can trash the VM as hard as they want but they will not damage a single pulse of data on the real host. On the other hand (you knew there was another hand, didn't you?), everything that happens on a VM seems quite real to a decker-drek, it is real as far as virtual reality is concerned. Crashing a VM will dump a decker, even though the crash will not affect the native host. System Tests made on a VM run up security tallies as usual, and IC on a VM feels every bit as nasty as IC on a native host. Program code running in a VM affects a decker's persona the same as it does anywhere else-usually painfully.

A VM's maximum System Ratings are 2 points lower than the native host's, though the security code can be the same. So a VM running on an Orange-7 host could have a maximum Security Rating of Orange-5. Similarly. If the native machine has Access-10, the maximum rating on the VM would be Access-8. A VM can be designed with lower ratings than these maximums, of course, Some hosts use this technique to camouflage themselves from deckers. The Intruder finds a cheesy Green-4 system, containing nothing but promotional simsense brochures and the general manager's laundry list, and (after marveling at how much it costs to launder real wool these days), departs for more lucrative pastures-without realizing he was on the executive accounting Red-8 host.

Rumor has it that some of the more powerful systems nest VM architectures. The decker logs on to a Green-4 system, detects that it is a VM and busts out into a Red-6 host. He loots it down to the last pulse and logs off, never realizing that the Red-6 host was actually a VM run on a Red-8 native host. All that paydata is fool's gold, carefully sanitized before it ever fed into the second layer of deception.

A decker can detect a VM by deliberately testing for it with an Analyze Host operation. Breaking out of a VM into the native host requires a Control Test against the native host's Security Rating (see System Ratings, p. 16). The number of successes the decker scores over the native host's opposing test determines whether or not he achieves his goal. One success enables a decker to break out of a Blue VM. Two successes are required for a Green VM, three successes for an Orange and four successes to break out of a Red VM. Because VMs are designed to confine user icons, a decker's security tally increases if he achieves successes on the Control Test but fails to break out of the VM. In this situation, increase the security tally by the number of successes by which the decker fell short. For example, a decker must achieve 3 successes to break out of an Orange VM. If the decker only scores 2 successes on his Control Test, raise his security tally 1 point. Each success the native host scored in the opposing test also is added to the security tally. If and when a decker does break out of a VM Into the native host, he retains his current security tally. If he had a Security Tally of 8 before he broke out and picked up 2 more points during his Control Test, he would have a Security Tally of 10 on the native host.

### PASSCODES

Passcodes consist of access codes that guarantee automatic success when attempting certain tasks or manipulating specific files on a computer. Any activity not authorized by the passcode requires System Tests and can jeopardize the passcode. For example, a passcode would enable a legitimate user to log on to his office host without performing a Logon to Host operation. He reads a file he has access to-no need for a Files Test, thanks to his passcode. But the passcode does him no good when he snoops into office e-mail and tries to read another user's mail (he does not have authorized access to the e-mail). He has perform Locate File and Download Data operations, same as a nasty old decker would, because he is working outside the authorizations of his passcode. The guy's in trouble if anyone catches him and checks the system logs, because his terminal identifies all his activities, legal and Illegal. On large, busy systems, minor violations like this often go undetected. They always show up within 2D6 days on systems rated Orange or Red, depending on how often the system security manager conducts audits.

#### Passcade formats

Simple passcodes consist of sets of symbols. The user enters the symbol set when he wants to log on to the host and if he does it right, the host grants him access. Because the Matrix is a virtual reality, passcode symbols can include letters, words, tunes, even specific movements. If a decker learns someone's passcode, he can use it to log on to the host anywhere the code is valid.

Linked passcodes work in combination with the MPCP signature of the user's terminal. Because a decker's persona will not have the same signature, the passcode alone will not work for him. However, a decker can use a deception utility to mimic the legitimate MPCP signature. In these situations, a stolen linked passcode provides a decker with a -2 bonus for his Logon to Host operation.

Passkeys are passcodes locked to a specific chip installed on the user's terminal. To use a stolen passkey, a decker must also steal or duplicate the key-chip. Software solutions such as the deception utility won't cut it. A passkey without the right chip on the terminal or deck simply does not work. If the decker gets the algorithm for the chip that goes with a given passkey, the "program" that he must write and cook into a chip is 10 Mp. See Cyberdecks, p. 81, and Programs, p. 94, for details of this process.

If a decker successfully uses a passcode to log on to a system, he receives all the authorizations the passcode's legitimate user possesses. The same applies to fake passcodes that the decker plants on the host for later use.

So why can't deckers just salt the Matrix with fake passcodes and then use them forever? Couple of reasons. First, all but the most lax system managers Insist on changing passcodes at least once every three months. High-security systems change them weekly. The most paranoid operators use algorithms that combine the date and time with a pseudo-random number generator to produce a new passcode every time a user needs to log on. In this arrangement, the users carry pocket units that tell them what their passcode will be at any given time. If they lose the pocket unit, they have to request a new one that will use a different passcode generation scheme. Organizations that use this system never install passcode generators.

Second, the system immediately deactivates passcodes whenever someone logged on with one performs any actions that trigger an active alert in the host. As long as the user only performs operations for which he has authorization, this won't happen. Unfortunately, few passcodes authorize the wide range of operations most deckers want to perform in a system.

Finally, many megacorp systems require a user to present his passkey code and submit to an identification check, such as a retinal scan, before granting the user access.

#### Passcode Authorization

These rules cannot cover all the options for how organizations can control passcodes, though most systems provide fairly specific authorizations. For example, a system might authorize a user with passcode MPCP 93847752-ADN-34626-ZZ to log on between 0800-1800 PST from (a list of jackpoint locations) and provide read/write access to (a list of files) and read-only access to (a list of files). When introducing specific passcodes into an adventure, the gamemaster must determine the authorizations the passcode provides. Use the following general levels of passcode authorizations as guidelines.

- **User Passcodes**: provide the lowest levels of authorization and impose precise restrictions on what the user can do, as In the previous example. They are of little use to a decker once he has logged on to the host. Most legitimate users carry user passcodes, with authorizations tailored precisely to their job requirements.
    
- **Superuser Passcodes**: consist of high-level passcodes that usually give the user the right to read all but the most sensitive files on a host or to access all but the most important Slave systems. This passcode does not authorize the user to perform operations involving Control, except for simple things like writing programs. Scramble IC, data bombs, and other defenses protect the system against superusers, though files or remote systems specifically authorized by the passcode do not block the user. In other words, stealing the superuser passcode for a finance manager would probably get a decker into the company's secret financial database, but a passcode for an engineering specialist probably would not. Organizations issue superuser passcodes to senior technical staff, line managers, and other mid-level suits.
    
- **Supervisor passcodes**: authorize almost any activity except destruction of important data or actions that damage the host or put it out of action. As with superuser passcodes. not all supervisor passcodes authorize access to everything. But until the host reaches an active alert, supervisor passcodes provide users with -2 modifiers to all System Tests target numbers, even for actions not authorized by the passcode. Only technical managers, senior managers in general, and data security specialists receive the rarely issued supervisor passcodes. Corp deckers receive the most powerful supervisor passcodes, for use when they are in pursuit of intruders on the hosts they guard.
    

### HOST NETWORKS

A host network consists of a series of computers linked in a tiered-access configuration. The first-tier host, called the switcher or hub, guards the pathway to all the second-tier machines. The host network offers a convenient design for the gamemaster setting up a situation involving many hosts, all basically identical, serving different functions in an organization. For example, the Accounting, Sales, Engineering, and Maintenance groups at a given corporate office are all separate hosts. Only the amount of paydata and the specific datafiles or slave systems onboard differentiate these hosts. The security sheaf for each host looks the same (see Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149); Arranging these hosts into a host network can provide ease of play and a logical design. In a typical two-tier network, a first-tier host-probably a high-security chokepoint system-connects the network to the grid. Any number of second-tier hosts live "behind" the first-tier machine. To travel from the hub to a second-tier system, a decker must perform an Analyze Subsystem operation on the Access subsystem of the first-tier host (unless the designers are wildly paranoid and hid the connection to the second-tier hosts in a trap door on a different subsystem) to find the connections, then perform a Logon to Host to the second-tier host. These operations Include the equivalent of a Graceful Logoff on the first-tier hub, so if the system is running Trace IC, add the IC rating to the decker's target number for the logon to the new host-the Trace will be registering strong objections to the hub's switching software about this departure, after all. However, if the decker successfully logs on to the second-tier host, the hub loses his datatrail, and any Trace running against him in the hub crashes.

To pass from any single host in a network to another, the decker must perform a Logon to Host operation from the second-tier machine back onto the hub, and then another Logon to Host to get to the next computer.

#### network files and lodes

A first-tier hub rarely contains data of any value. Because the hub functions as the "traffic cop" for the network, however, it must "know" what functions its second-tier machines handles. As a result, deckers on a hub can perform operations such as Locate File or Locate Slave for the entire host network. These operations can Identify which second-tier host contains a specific datafile or controls a certain remote device. Once the decker logs on to the correct second-tier host, another Locate File or Locate Slave operation provides the address of the icon he wants.

### UU HOSTS

Ultraviolet hosts are extremely rare. They possess higher System Ratings than the toughest Red hosts, and their processing power is so great that it creates cyberspace of a qualitatively different order of reality. On a UV host, a decker cannot differentiate between the virtual experience of cyberspace and physical reality. This makes UV hosts an entirely different creation from any other form of host.

Only a hot deck (see Cyberdecks, p. 81) can even log on to a UV host. Cool decks and tortoises cannot interact with the core processing area of a UV host. They can access so called buffer systems, which translate data flows into and out of the main computational space, but nothing more. Icons representing cool decks or terminals cannot cross the interface between the buffer systems and the UV core.

On a UV host, the decker's persona changes-often drastically. It becomes a character with Strength and Body Ratings equal to its Bod Rating, Quickness equal to the persona's Evasion Rating, and Mental Attributes equal to the decker's own. Utility programs become physical tools, weapons, armor, and the like, or have no effect at all, depending on the nature of those utilities and the exact defenses located within the UV host. The decker uses his real skills in a UV host but may always substitute half his Computer skill Instead.

But here's the most fun part of UV hosts. Any damage to the decker's persona is damage to the decker himself. If his persona experiences Mental damage, his own Mental Condition Monitor reflects it. If his persona suffers apparent physical damage, it is Physical damage. Jacking out of a UV host exposes the decker to 12D Stun damage from dump shock. If he's already taken a beating, that could overflow his Mental Condition Monitor and prove fatal.

Apart from these guidelines, anything goes. Consider the physical laws of LIV cyberspace Infinitely flexible. The gamemaster may, and must, define them to suit the particular run. Not that runs to UV space are that common. Getting there is dangerous, logging on puts the decker at profound risk, and there aren't that many LIV systems out there. At the current time (2056), LIV hosts remain nothing more than rumors among the decking community, Right?

#### Where Are the UV Hosts?

No one is entirely sure which matrices harbor LIV hosts. The Denver Nexus definitely has UV qualities in some of its memory spaces. Rumor says the UCAS government maintains a site of UV cyberspace, but thousands of rumors put it In as many different locations. Other reports claim that the governments of Tir na nOg and, startlingly, the Zulu Nation maintain UV hosts The main processing cores of supercomplexes such as the Zurich-O and the Renraku Arcology may be Ultraviolet as well. What's more, certain evidence suggests that a sufficiently powerful processing complex can develop Ultraviolet levels of virtual reality without the knowledge of Its operators. The UV area of the core processing space may come and go, depending on the amount of available computer power on the system. This, of course, raises the alarming possibility that a decker might find himself in what he fondly believed to be a humble Red-12 system that transforms suddenly into a UV environment. Gamemasters might consider hitting deckers caught in such a radical and disorientating transformation with some equivalent of dump shock. One theory contends that UV cyberspace cannot exist without an Al maintaining It. However, no verifiable data supports the existence of Als, and so the origin of spontaneous UV cyberspace environments remains a matter of speculation.

### IC

IC stands for Intrusion countermeasures. (For all you Matrix virgins, It's pronounced "Ice.") Some IC just impedes the decker, maybe tries to get a network ID on him. Other programs are designed to crash his icon off the Matrix. Still others go after his deck. Finally, there's black IC-which flat out tries to kill him. IC Is a major functional element of most host systems, which were covered in the previous section. However, any explanation of IC Inevitably involves system operations and cybercombat. In-depth coverage of these subjects appears in the sections titled Programs (p. 94), System Operations (p. 108) and Cybercombat (p. 119).

#### PROACTIVE VS. REACTIVE

IC Is either proactive or reactive. Proactive IC attacks the decker In cybercombat once it is alerted to his presence (see Cybercombat. p. 119). Proactive IC acts like a hostile NPC. It makes Initiative rolls during combat, maneuvers for advantage, and uses its weapons and other tricks. Reactive IC, on the other hand, just "sits there." It may activate when the security tally reaches a specific threshold, decker actions may trigger it, or it may reside in a specific location or resource of the host, such as a file, slave remote, or even an entire subsystem. In the latter case, the IC becomes active when a decker accesses the protected location or resource. Once a decker triggers reactive IC, the IC affects the decker's operations until the decker destroys or deceives it, or otherwise convinces it to go away. Reactive IC rarely possesses Initiative. Trace IC offers an exception to the proactive/reactive rule. Trace IC uses Initiative when trying to lock on to a decker's comm connection and begin the actual trace process. At all other times it acts as reactive IC, running happily in the background once it Identifies the decker's datatrail.

#### LOCATING IC

Deckers don't always know when they trigger IC. Before a decker can attack IC or take other measures to neutralize it, a decker must "locate" the IC. Obviously, a decker can easily locate proactive IC as soon as it attacks him. Once located, the IC remains "visible" unless it maneuvers to escape the decker (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121). Reactive IC is more insidious, because it does not betray its presence to the decker by any actions. Whenever a decker triggers reactive IC, the gamemaster secretly makes a Sensor Test against a target number equal to the IC's rating. If the test results in 1 success, the gamemaster informs the decker that his actions triggered IC. On 2 successes, the gamemaster tells the decker the type of IC triggered. On 3 or more successes, the gamemaster reveals the IC's rating and location. This Sensor Test is made only once, when the IC becomes active. If a decker suspects the presence of active IC, he can use the Locate IC operation to check out that suspicion.

#### CRASHING IC

Whenever a decker "kills" or crashes IC in cybercombat, add the rating of the crashed IC to the decker's security tally. The rationale for this is that crashing IC is like opening up on a perimeter guard with full autocannon fire-the action destroys the guard but alerts his colleagues that company's coming. However, deckers may use various methods to more quietly crash or neutralize IC. First, deckers may use the stealth option with attack programs (see Programs, p. 94). This reduces the number of points added to the security tally for the IC's destruction. For example, crashing a Probe-6 with an attack program normally adds 6 points to a decker's security tally. Attack with the Stealth-3 option, however, would reduce the points to 3. Stealth programs rated at 6 or higher hide the "dying scream" of IC altogether.

If the gamemaster chooses to not use the Utility Options optional rule, he simply may increase a decker's security tally by half the rating of any IC the decker destroys (round fractions up). The Utility Options rule makes life significantly less dangerous for the decker (as does the use of the stealth option in particular), but it may also make life significantly less challenging and interesting to drek-hot deckers with meganuyen cyberdecks and utilities. The gamemaster may also decide that this "half-rating" rule applies only to certain systems. For example, it might apply to Blue, Green and Orange systems but not to Red systems where the IC can be expected to be especially vicious and the system more ready to shift to a higher alert status.

#### SUPPRESSING IC

A decker also can avoid the penalty for crashing IC by suppressing it when he destroys it. However, suppressing IC lowers a decker's Detection Factor. Reduce a decker's Detection Factor by 1 for each IC program he suppresses. This reduction remains in effect as long as the decker remains in the system, unless he releases the suppressed IC. Deckers must declare their intention to suppress IC as soon as they crash it. Deckers may "unsuppress" or release IC at any time. For each IC program the decker releases, he regains 1 point to his Detection Factor. His security tally, however, Increases by the appropriate amount for each released IC program.

#### IC RATINGS

Each IC program has its own rating. This rating measures the damage the IC does or acts as a target number for tests the decker makes to avoid its effects. In cybercombat, an IC program makes its Attack Tests using its host's Security Value as a "skill", to determine, the number of dice it rolls. In other words, the host computer attacks the decker and uses the IC as a weapon. The host/grid's Security Value also indicates the number of dice rolled to make Damage Resistance Tests for the IC program.

#### WHITE IC

White IC affects only the decker's online icon. It attacks the icon's ratings but does not affect the cyberdeck's permanent ratings or utilities. The worst that white IC can do is dump a decker or scramble data he is trying to read or write. Note, however, that a decker operating a hot deck may suffer some slight physical damage from simsense overload if he's dumped by white IC (see Cybercombat, p. 119). Matrix 2.0 eliminates access and barrier IC. The new rules for System Ratings replace the functions performed by these types of IC.

##### CRIPPLERS

Cripplers are proactive white IC programs that each attack one of the decker's icon's attributes. Cripplers come in four types acid, binder, jammer, or marker programs. Acid cripplers attack an icon's Bod Rating. Binder cripplers attack an Icon's Evasion Rating. Jammer cripplers attack the Sensor Rating, and marker cripplers attack the Masking Rating.

Whenever a crippler program attacks an icon, the gamemaster makes an Attack Test for the host and tallies the successes (see Cybercombat. p. 119, for details on Attack Tests). At the same time, the decker makes an opposed test for the affected icon attribute against a target number equal to the crippler IC's rating. If the decker achieves a greater or equal number of successes, the IC does no damage. Reduce the affected icon attribute by 1 point for every 2 net successes the IC scores. Yes, that means 1 net success for the IC does no damage. Two successes do 1 point of damage, four successes do 2 points, and so on.

Neither Armor not Hardening (see p. 80) protect against cripplers. Crippler IC cannot reduce/an icon attribute below 1.

Selena is on an Orange-5 system when she's attacked by Acid-4 crippler IC. The gamemaster makes an Attack Test for the IC and achieves 4 successes. Selena's icon has a Bod Rating 6, so she rolls 6 dice when she makes her Bod (4) Test to resist the IC. Selena scores 2 successes-2 fewer successes than the acid IC. As a result, Selena's Bod Rating drops to 5.

##### KILLER

Killer IC is proactive IC that causes damage to icons in cybercombat. All killer IC has a Damage Code and its Power is equal to its IC rating. The Damage Level of killer IC is based on the host's security code. Killer IC on Blue or Green systems does Medium damage; killer IC on Orange and Red systems does Serious damage. For example, Killer-6 IC on an Orange host would do 6S damage. This damage rises a stage for every 2 successes achieved on the host's Attack Test, just like damage in standard combat. If an attack from killer IC fills the Condition Monitor of a decker the decker is dumped. Armor utility programs reduce damage from killer IC. (Note that killer IC is classified as gray IC in SRII. However, it does not cause permanent damage to a cyberdeck's permanent ratings or utilities, so it is classified as white IC in Matrix 2.0 rules.)

##### DATA BOMB

A data bomb is reactive IC that acts as a booby trap attached to a specific datafile or remote device under the Slave subsystem. Once set, the data bomb remains In place, waiting and ready to explode if a decker attempts to access whatever It is protecting; the data bomb does not rely on the security tally for its cue. Deckers can find a data bomb by performing an Analyze Icon operation. The decker must make a successful System Test against the controlling subsystem to defuse It. The defuse utility augments this test. For example, if the bomb is on a file, the decker must make a Computer (Files Rating - Defuse Rating) Test to disarm it. If the bomb is on the security cameras at a corporate site, however, the decker would make a Computer (Slave Rating - Defuse Rating) Test.

Data bombs remain primed if the decker fails this test, unless he rolls all 1's. Normally, a decker can try to defuse a data bomb as many times as necessary, though, as with any System Test, each time the decker tries he may increase the security tally. Successfully defusing the data bomb does not count as crashing it, so do not add the bomb's rating to the security tally. If the data bomb is successfully defused, the decker need not suppress it.

If the decker fails to defuse a data bomb and then makes a successful System Test to open the datafile, read or write the I/O device or slave system; or otherwise succeeds in a test to access the booby-trapped subsystem, the data bomb explodes. A test that fails does not set it off. If a thief cannot bust the maglock on a safe, then he can't open it to trigger the bomb inside. Same idea applies here. When a data bomb explodes, it automatically hits the persona, doing (IC rating)M damage which the icon resists normally. Armor utilities reduce the Power of the damage as usual. The "explosion" also adds the IC's rating to the security tally. The decker can avoid increasing the security tally by spending 1 point cof his Detection Factor to suppress the IC.

Scaramouche ghosts up to a file full of, he hopes, paydata. If the file is the one he wants, it is likely protected somehow, so Scaramouche runs an Analyze Icon op on it. Yup, figgers, Scrambled AND with a data bomb attached. Scaramouche makes a Files Test because the bomb is on a file. Scaramouche has invaded a Green-5 host with Files-11, and the data bomb is rated 6. Scaramouche risks a few seconds to swap Defuse-5 into active memory and upload it. This lets him roll against a Target Number of 11 (Files Rating) - 5 (Defuse Utility Rating), for a total of 6. He scores 1 success, but the Security Test scores 2. The gamemaster smirks and tells him it ain't good enough. The data bomb is not defused.

Sweating a bit, Scaramouche rolls again, getting 2 successes. But the host scores 3, so the data bomb is still active. By now, Scaramouche figures he's been doing well on his tests, so these repeated failures mean the host is scoring lots of successes and jacking up the security tally in a real nasty fashion. Scaramouche decides to drop subtlety and rips open the datafile. Since he has a Browse-8 program, he passes the test handily, and so the bomb goes off in his virtual face. Scaramouche takes a 6M hit. He has Armor-4, so he rolls Bod 10 resist the damage against a Target Number of 2, and stages down the damage to L. He decides to use a point of Detection Factor to suppress the IC to keep the security tally from going up another 6 points.

##### PROBE

Probe IC is reactive IC that conducts additional Interrogations of data packets and program requests for computer resources. Probe IC helps detect any operations performed by unauthorized programs. For a probe-equipped system, the gamemaster makes a Probe Test against a decker's Detection Factor every time the decker makes a System Test. Add any successes from the Probe Test to the decker's security tally.

##### SCRAMBLE

Scramble IC is reactive IC used to protect elements of a host's Access, Files, or Slave subsystems. Scramble IC can be programmed to protect a specific component of a subsystem or the entire subsystem. For example, scramble IC can protect an Individual data file, a datastore, or all the Files functions on a host-Including faxprinter output and dedicated terminals. Similarly, scramble IC on an Access subsystem can oppose logons from specific entry points, such as public grids and dedicated workstations, or all logons. On a Slave subsystem, scramble IC can defend specific remote devices or all devices connected to the subsystem.

Scramble IC comes In two varieties: exploding and poison. Exploding IC programs are linked to data bombs. If a decker decrypts or crashes exploding IC before defusing the bomb, boom! Poison IC programs destroy the data under their care if they detect intruders. Generally, organizations use poison IC only on extremely sensitive data which they have backed up off the Matrix. If the decker tries to decrypt poison IC and fails, the gamemaster makes a Poison Test against a target number equal to the decker's Computer skill. If the test falls, the decker has managed to suppress the poison IC's destruct code. If the rest succeeds, the data is destroyed. Poison IC reacts the same way on each action of a cybercombat attack against it.

Deckers may use specific system operations to defeat scramble IC, all of which can be augmented by the decryption utility program (see System Operations, p. 108). Decrypting scramble IC does not add to the decker's security tally. Deckers can use attack programs to crash scramble IC, but doing so will increase the decker's security tally unless he suppresses the scramble IC.

##### TAR BABY

Tar baby is reactive IC that attempts to crash deckers' utility programs, specifically, operational utilities used in System Tests and any program a decker executes for a specific purpose. Tar baby IC does not attack completely passive utilities such as armor and sleaze programs.

Whenever a decker uses one of the trigger utilities, the gamemaster makes an opposed test between the two programs. Make the Tar Baby Test against a target number equal to the utility program's rating. Make the Utility Test against a target number equal to the tar baby IC's rating.

If the tar baby wins the opposed test, it crashes both Itself and the utility program. Tar baby IC does not increase the decker's security tally when it crashes this way. The decker has to load a fresh copy of the utility program with a Swap Memory operation. If the utility wins the opposed test, it remains safe and the gamemaster makes a secret Sensor Test to determine if the decker notices the tar baby IC (see Locating IC, p. 40).

Tar baby IC can be placed in a construct, party IC, or used with trap IC. In these cases, only utilities used against the construct, party, or trap IC are vulnerable. However, the Tar Baby Test modifies its target number by -2. Once the tar baby IC crashes, it is out of that construct-it doesn't reappear. Of course, the construct could contain multiple tar baby programs.

Note that tar baby IC is classified as white IC under Matrix 2.0 rules, because it does not permanently affect the utility programs it attacks.

Selena is on a run when she performs a system operation using Analyze-6. The utility triggers a Tar Baby-8 program that makes a grab at the utility. The gamemaster makes a Tar Baby (6) Test for the IC and an Analyze (8) Test for the analyze program. The Tar Baby Test achieves more net successes, and so both the IC and the utility crash.

#### GRAY IC

Gray IC programs attack a decker's cyberdeck and utilities directly. Any damage caused by a gray IC attack permanently affects the deck's ratings. Damaged chips and other components must be replaced to restore the deck's original ratings.

##### BLASTER

Blaster IC is proactive IC that attacks in cybercombat in the same manner as killer IC (see Killer, p. 41). Armor reduces damage from blaster attacks. However, blaster IC may permanently damage a decker's cyberdeck MPCP if It crashes his icon. If blaster IC dumps a decker, make a Blaster Test against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating. Hardening increases the target number but armor does not. Reduce the MPCP Rating by 1 point for every 2 successes on the Blaster Test. Note that the decker may need to crank down his persona programs if his deck takes damage, because their total ratings may not exceed the deck's MPCP Rating multiplied by 3 (see Cyberdecks. p. 84).

It's not Selena's day. The program that blew her off the Matrix wasn't just killer as she'd hoped-it was a Blaster-6 program. Selena's deck has MPCP-6 and Hardening-2, so the gamemaster makes a Blaster (8) Test. The test produces two successes, so Selena's MPCP Rating is permanently reduced to 5. If she goes on a run before replacing it, she'll have to adjust her persona programs to make sure their total ratings don't exceed 15.

##### RIPPERS

Ripper IC is a gray version of crippler IC. These proactive IC attack In the same manner (see Cripplers, p. 41), but whenever a ripper program damages an icon, make a Ripper Test against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating. Hardening Increases the target number. Reduce the rating of the deck's persona chip by 1 for each success on the test. Replacing the persona chip is the only way to restore this damage.

Four different types of ripper IC exist: acid-rip, bind-rip, jam-rip, and mark-rip. Acid-rip, also known as "bodstripper," "sizzer," or "peeler," attacks the deck's Bod Rating. Bind-rip, also known as "gluefoot," "mummy," or "flypaper," attacks the Evasion Rating. Jam-rip, also known as "blinder," "gouger," or "stick," attacks the Sensor Rating, Mark-rip, also called "screamer," "paint," or "tag," attacks the Masking Rating.

##### SPARKY

The proactive IC called sparky IC attacks in the same manner as blaster IC (see Blaster). However, if sparky IC crashes the persona, it causes an overload in the deck's power supply that feeds random jolts of electricity to the MPCP and the decker's brain. Results can range from a little impromptu electroshock therapy to a killing jolt. This is dark gray IC Indeed-bordering on black-but because it is not designed to deliberately cause physical trauma, it is technically considered non-lethal.

Whenever sparky IC crashes a persona, make a Sparky Test against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating + 2. Hardening increases the target number. Reduce the MPCP Rating by 1 point for every 2 successes of the Sparky Test. A sparky attack also causes (IC Rating)M damage to the decker. Stage the Damage up one level for every 2 successes on the Sparky Test. The decker resists this damage as he would any other. Hardening reduces the Power of the damage.

HeadCrash gets trashed off the nets by a Sparky-8 program. The Sparky Test yields 2 successes. That melts 1 point off the MPCP right away. It also raises the Damage Level to HeadCrash from 8M to 8S. Head's meatbod has a Body Rating 4 and his deck has Hardening-1. He rolls a Damage Resistance Test: 4 dice (his Body) against a target number of 5 (Sparky Rating of 6 - 1 for Hardening). His test produces 1 success, which does not stage down the damage. Can you say ZAP ?!

##### TAR PIT

The reactive IC known as tar pit IC operates and attacks in the same manner as tar baby IC (see Tar Baby, p. 42). However, if tar pit IC trashes a utility online, it also injects the deck with viral code that corrupts all copies of the program in the deck's active and storage memories. Unless the decker has a backup copy of the utility stashed in offline memory, he's lost it for good. And even if he has a backup, he can't get at it for the rest of the run.

When tar pit IC trashes a program, make a Tar Pit Test against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating. Hardening increases the target number. If the test produces no successes, the viral code is defeated and the tar pit IC has the same effect as the tar baby program, so the decker can reload his utility with a Swap Memory operation. If the Tar Pit Test produces any successes, however, the IC corrupts all copies of the program stored on the deck. The decker cannot get the utility back until he jacks out and reloads the utility from a source outside his deck (from a storage chip, most likely).

##### WORMS

Worms are reactive virus programs used to booby trap subsystems. Any System Test against a subsystem infected with worm IC prompts the worm to infect the MPCP of a decker's cyberdeck. Deckers can detect worm IC programs by performing Analyze Subsystem operations. However, if a worm inhabits the subsystem, it tries to infect the decker when he analyzes it.

Deckers can destroy worms by performing Disinfect operations or by cybercombat. However, if an attempt to destroy a worm fails, the worm can Infect the deck's MPCP. Worms have no IC Rating as such, so destroying one by either means does not affect the security tally. To determine whether a worm successfully infects a deck's MPCP. make a test using the Security Value of the host against a target number equal to the MPCP Rating of the deck. On 1 success, the worm has invaded the MPCP. If the deck has Hardening, this test must result in a number of successes greater than the deck's Hardening to infect the MPCP.

Once a worm Infects an MPCP, it cannot be erased. The decker has to cook a whole new MPCP chip. A worm Infection cannot be detected unless a decker actively tests for it, a task requiring Computer skill (or an appropriate Hardware or B/R skill) and a Base Time of 10 hours. The decker may run the test periodically, as often as caution-or paranoia-dictates, or if he experiences problems that suggest the presence of a worm. Worm IC v1.0 was developed as a Matrix weapon by Lone Star's GridSec programmers, More recent worm programs-dataworm and deathworm-have Increased dramatically the dangers presented by worm IC.

- **Dataworms**: Dataworms log information about a decker's runs and report it to their owners. Each time a dataworm-infected deck logs onto a grid, roll 1D6. On a result of 1, the dataworm tries to send a report chock full of incriminating evidence to some specified delivery address. At the same time, make a Sensor (8) Test for the decker. If the test falls, he doesn't even know the system has a dataworm. If the test succeeds, the decker notices the dataworm report and may engage it in cybercombat to destroy it before it gets away. In cybercombat, dataworm reports always act as standard icons with 3D6 Initiative and an effective Evasion Rating of 8. They possess no offensive capabilities, but will maneuver to Evade Detection (see Cybercombat, p. 119, for a complete treatment of these concepts). The effects of dataworm reports depend on the events in the adventure. If the decker gets arrested, the reports serve as admissible evidence against him, even if he was not arrested for Matrix crimes. If the decker uses his deck in a detectable pattern, the dataworm will report it. This allows a gamemaster to reasonably give non-player characters the e-mail names and addresses the decker uses, the identities of people with whom he communicates, and the BBSs he logs on to-as long as he employed that specific data while using the infected deck.
    
- **Deathworms**: A deathworm Infection increases a deck's target numbers by 2 in cybercombat. This increase applies to all Attack and Resistance tests made by the decker. If the deck picks up multiple deathworm infections, each additional worm increases the target numbers by an additional +1.
    
- **Tapeworms**: Tapeworms erase files downloaded onto a deck. To determine how much data the tapeworm deletes, roll 1D6 - 1 at the end of each run. Subtract the result from any Paydata Points the decker downloaded on the run. If the decker downloaded a specific datafile to obtain information, roll 1D6. On a result of 5 or 6, the tapeworm corrupts the needed information and renders it irretrievable. Once a tapeworm infects a deck's MPCP, it continues to affect all the deck's downloads in this manner until the decker replaces the chip.


TRACE IC

Trace IC is a hybrid of white and gray IC programs. Basically, trace IC works in two distinct stages: the hunt cycle and the location cycle. During the hunt cycle, trace IC tries to get a fix on the decker's datatrail. It does this by "attacking" the decker in cybercombat. The target number for these Attack Tests is the decker's Trace Factor (see below). The location cycle is a fixed period of time, based on the number of successes the trace IC scores when it finally "hits" the decker. The Matrix 1.0 functions of Trace & Dump and Trace & Burn are not available in Matrix 2.0, though their effects can be duplicated. Trace IC performs the functions of Matrix 1.0's Trace & Report program. Under Matrix 2.0, a successful Trace also enhances the effects of other IC programs.

TRACE FACTOR

The base Trace Factor is equal to the decker's current Evasion Rating minus the trace IC's rating. Add the rating of any camo utility the decker is running, as well as the number of grids-LTGs, RTGs, and PLTGs-where the decker has performed Redirect Datatrail operations during this run (see System Operations, p. 117). In addition, apply any trace modifiers for the decker's jackpoint (see Jackpoints, p. 28). If using the optional bandwidth rule (see Cyberdecks, p. 90) apply any trace modifiers for the decker's current bandwidth. The formula, again, is actual bandwidth divided by base bandwidth, rounded down and multiplied by -1.

Vanessa has illegally tapped into the commlines in the basement of a low-security office building. She went to the trouble of getting into an office building because the business service lines there give her a Base Bandwidth of 50 Mp. Her total bandwidth at the moment is 165 Mp. That calls for -3 to the Trace Factor (165/50 = 3.3, round down to 3, 3 x -1 = -3). Vanessa left Datatrail Redirects on the local LTG to hide her jackpoint and the host she is targeting. That's 2 Datatrail Redirects, for a +2 to the Trace Factor.

Vanessa's deck is running a Camo-4 utility and has an Evasion Rating of 9. The host is running a Trace-8 program. That leaves Vanessa with a Trace Factor of 4.

    Evasion Rating - Trace Rating + Bandwidth modifier + number of Datatrail Redirects + Camo Rating

    9-8 +(-3) +2+4=4

HUNT CYCLE

During the hunt cycle, trace IC makes Attack Tests against the decker using Initiative and other rules for cybercombat. The decker's Trace Factor is the target number for these tests. The hunt cycle lasts until the trace IC achieves a successful test. During the hunt cycle, the decker can attack the trace IC in cybercombat and try to crash it. Relocate utility programs are not effective during the hunt cycle.

LOCATION CYCLE

The location cycle begins as soon as the trace IC makes a successful Attack Test against a decker. The IC immediately "disappears" and becomes reactive IC.

Divide 10 turns by the number of successes achieved in the trace IC's Attack Test. The result, rounded down, is the number of turns the trace IC needs to complete its cycle and locate the decker's jackpoint. During that time, the decker may attempt to locate the IC and neutralize it by spending a Complex Action to perform a Locate IC operation to locate trace IC. If the decker cannot do this in time, the IC Identifies the decker's Matrix and meatworld locations and reveals them to the host's operators. (See Trace Effects, p. 46, for other consequences.)

For the purposes of measuring a trace IC location cycle, Combat Turns are considered completed once they reach Phase 0. If a decker can freeze or destroy the IC before Phase 0 of a Combat Turn, that turn is considered completed. Crashing a trace IC program with combat code produces the standard penalty to the decker's security tally (see Security Tally, p. 19). Defeating trace IC with a relocate utility has no effect on the security tally.

Vanessa is on a Red-8 host when she is attacked by a trace program. The trace IC Attack Test produces 6 successes-ouch! Ten divided by 6 produces 1.7, rounded down to 1. If Vanessa can't take out the IC, it will trace her in only 1 Combat Turn! The IC vanishes and the clock is ticking. Vanessa tries a Locate IC operation on her last action of the present turn and finds the program's address. She will try to beat it next turn.

DEFEATING TRACE IC

A decker can defeat a trace program three ways. During the program's hunt cycle, the decker can attack it in cybercombat and attempt to destroy it. During the location cycle, the decker can run for it or use a relocate utility.

Run for It

A Graceful Logoff operation enables a decker to get away and immediately stop the location cycle of a trace program. However, trace IC tries to prevent this operation, so increase the decker's target number for the operation by the IC's rating (see System Operations, p. 114, for details).

Simply jacking out of the system will not defeat trace IC, because jacking out leaves the comm links in the network open for a measurable period. First, the LTG has to verify carrier signal loss. Then it gracefully dismantles the decker's datatrail, the same way a user-initiated Graceful Logoff does. Just because a decker jacks out doesn't mean his datatrail disappears in a big puff of bits. If a decker does jack out, roll 1D6 - 1 (minimum value is 1). The result is the number of turns the decker's datatrail remains intact. If the die roll result equals or exceeds the number of turns left in the trace program's location cycle, the IC will still locate the jackpoint.

Relocate It

To use a relocate utility to defeat a trace program, a decker must spend a Simple Action to make a Control Test (the relocate utility reduces the target number). The gamemaster makes an opposing Security Test for the host/grid. Any successes for the opposing Security Test are added to the decker's security tally.

If the decker's Control Test succeeds, he successfully "spoofs" the trace program. Its sampling algorithms are sent on a wild goose chase. However, unless the decker keeps that trace suppressed (see Suppressing IC, p. 40), the trace will pick up where it left off, so the gamemaster should note how many turns were left in the location cycle when the decker completed his Control Test. If the decker chooses not to keep the trace program suppressed, he can use a relocate utility again any time during each turn. If he succeeds, the trace IC remains neutralized for that turn. If he fails, the trace program ticks one turn closer to finishing its task.

Defeating a trace program with a relocate utility does not count as crashing the IC, and so it does not add the penalty to the security tally created by destroying the IC with an attack utility.

Vanessa has only one Combat Turn to beat the trace program. On her first action, she uses the relocate utility. She has Computer-16 and is running Relocate-4. The IC is Trace-8. Vanessa rolls 18 dice (Computer Skill) against a Target Number of 8 (IC Rating) -4 (Relocate Rating). The host opposes this with the usual test: Security Value (Detection Factor). Vanessa, rolling 18 dice against a Target Number of 4, scores 4 successes. The host scores 3. Vanessa successfully blocks the trace this turn, but the security tally goes up another 3 points. Vanessa can either allocate a point of her Detection Factor to keep the trace IC frozen, or can try to use the relocate utility against it again next turn. If she fails to do either, the IC will finish tracing her jackpoint on Phase 0 of the Combat Turn.

TRACE EFFECTS

If a trace program completes its location cycle successfully, several things happen. First, the system records the jackpoint's network address and physical location in its security logs. That means that any security assets in the meatworld monitoring the invaded system can initiate physical measures against the decker's location (i.e., they send out the goons). More immediately dangerous to the decker are the IC-targeting and tally-acceleration bonuses that the host receives.

IC Targeting

The IC-targeting bonus reduces by 1 all target numbers for Attack Tests the system's proactive IC programs make against the decker in cybercombat.

Tally Acceleration

When the tally-acceleration bonus is in effect, add 1 to any Increase to the decker's security tally. For example, if the host scores 2 successes in a System Test, add 3 to the security tally.
#### SECURITY ASSET RESPONSE TIMES

| Jackpoint Is In Security Rating: | Target Is: | Public   | Corporate | Megacorp | Government |
| -------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | --------- | -------- | ---------- |
| B or higher                      |            | 10 + 2D6 | 15 - ZD6  | 8+2D6    | 10 + 1D6   |
| C                                |            | 10 + 4D6 | 15 + 3D6  | 10 +1D6  | 10 + 1D6   |
| D                                |            | 20 + 4D6 | 10- 2D6   | 5 + 1D6  | 5 + ID6    |
| Z                                |            | NA       | 10 - 1D6  | 5 - 106  | 5+ 1D6     |
| On Site                          |            | NA       | 2D6 + 2   | ID6 + 2  | 2D6 + 2    |
#### Physical Measures

The physical measures triggered by a successful trace program really depend on a large number of variables. For example, say the trace IC has reported that the decker is tapped into a dataline in Redmond, at such-and-such a location. The speed of a physical response depends entirely on what resources the invaded system's owners have, jurisdictional concerns (see Matrix Law, p: 132), the location of the nearest useful assets, whether Lone Star or any other local law-enforcement agency has been called in, the standard Security Rating of the site, and so on. The gamemaster may use his own discretion or dice rolls to determine the time it takes for security assets (i.e., goons) to reach the decker's jackpoint. If using dice rolls, consult the Security Asset Response Times table. The result of the dice roll is the response time in minutes. Keep in mind that all response times are simply suggested guidelines. "Government" entries in the table assume a UCAS setting-response times may be longer for less organized governments and shorter for efficient, paranoid ones. Cruel gamemasters can always determine that by some wretched misfortune the corp or government in question just happens to have a "strategic asset" (i.e., goon squad) near the scene that can reach the decker's location In, oh, 30 seconds or so.

"On site" jackpoints refer to entry points inside a manned location that belongs to the system's owner. For example, a decker jacking into a government host from inside a federal office building is on site.

### TRAP TRACE

The functions of the Matrix 1.0 programs Trace & Dump or Trace & Burn can be reproduced by combining or "trapping" trace IC with a program that can blow the icon off the grid-such as killer IC-or gray IC programs that attack decks directly, such as blaster or sparky IC. Of course, trace also may be combined with black IC to create lethal trapped trace IC.

Trapping trace IC reduces the trace program's effectiveness. When linking trace and gray IC programs, add half the gray IC rating to the Trace Factor of any persona targeted by the trace IC. When linking trace and black IC programs, add the full black IC rating to any targeted decker's Trace Factor. See Trap IC, p. 50, for more information.

### TRACE ON A GRID

Trace triggered by a grid keeps working against the decker as long as he remains on any grid controlled by the same RTG. If he defeats the IC on an LTG, he must keep it suppressed or keep relocating it as long as he is on that LTG, Its parent RTG, or any other LTG governed by that RTG (see Suppressing IC, p. 40, and Relocate It, p. 46, for details). On the other hand, the IC loses interest in tracking the decker once he has logged onto a host or another RTG or PLTG.

If the trace IC has been triggered by the RTG that governs the decker's jackpoint, or by an LTG attached to that RTG, then the IC can immediately dump the decker once it detects his jackpoint. In such circumstances a killer-type attack is not necessary, because the central switchers for the RTG accept control directives directly from the IC. This option is not available to a trace originating on other grids or hosts.

### BLACK IC

Black IC is a form of proactive IC that samples the command transactions between the decker and his deck and then injects dangerous biofeedback responses into the deck's ASIST interface. These feedback responses raise the deck's simsense signal to the same levels as a BTL chip on overdose Intensity. As a result, the signal may overload the decker's neural connections and in turn render him unconscious, trigger psychological disorders, brainwash him, or cause death from stroke, heart failure, respiratory paralysis, aneurysm, or neurotransmitter autotoxicity. And those are just a few of the possible effects.

"Cool" decks, which use weaker ASIST signals, do not produce lethal simsense signals in such situations, though deckers using cool decks remain vulnerable to stun damage and psychotropic IC. Only the most feeble, non-simsense terminals, the so-called tortoises, provide protection against these effects. (See ICCM, p. 86 in Cyberdecks, for more information.)

#### BLACK IC IN COMBAT

Black IC begins to subvert the ASIST Interface in a decker's cyberdeck as soon as it scores a successful attack on the decker, even if the hit does no damage. Until the IC scores that first attack, jacking out of the Matrix is a Free Action. After a black IC hit, the decker must spend a Complex Action and make a successful Willpower (Black IC Rating) Test to jack out. If the test succeeds, the decker may jack out, but the black IC makes one more cybercombat attack against him before the connection goes down. Black IC also makes an automatic attack if a companion at the jackpoint pulls the plug when the deck indicates black IC activity, or if the decker jacks out using an ICCM biofeedback monitor (see Cyberdecks, p. 81).

#### LETHAL BLACK IC

Lethal black IC fights like killer IC in cybercombat. However, successful lethal black IC attacks cause damage to a decker and his icon. The Damage Code for the IC depends on the Security Code of the Host: (IC Rating) Moderate for Blue and Green systems, (IC Rating) Serious for Orange and Red ones. The Damage Code applies to damage to both the decker and his icon.

Raise the Damage Level for every 2 successes on the IC's Attack Test. Every time black IC hits a decker, the decker rolls two Resistance Tests. Hardening reduces the Power of the damage for these Resistance Tests. A Body Resistance Test, using his Body Attribute, enables the decker to resist damage to his person. The Hacking Pool may not be used for this test, though Karma Pool dice may be. The decker also makes a Resistance Test using his icon's Bod Rating to resist damage to the icon. The icon resists damage as it resists damage from killer IC (see Killer, p. 41), and armor protects the icon normally.

The decker's Matrix connection remains Intact if the icon is killed before the decker dies or manages to jack out. In such cases, the IC completely dominates the decker's icon bandwidth. Increase the effective rating of the IC by 2 (even if the optional bandwidth rule is not in use). Of course, the decker cannot fight back at all with his icon down. All he can do is try to jack out before the IC kills him.

The Matrix connection automatically goes down if black IC kills the decker. But before it turns the deck loose, the black IC gets a shot at the MPCP, making the attack as if it were blaster IC, with double its rating. If the black IC completely destroys the MPCP, the IC deletes all data downloaded by the decker during the run. It deletes any such data stored in any connected storage memory as well, and reduces the MPCP's Rating to 0.

Lethal black IC damage overflows in the same manner as Physical damage to a _Shadowrun_ character. Overflow damage from lethal black IC represents Increased levels of brain damage. If the overflow is high enough, the decker may receive irreversible damage that leaves him brain-dead even if life support can be established. If the decker can be revived, all the rules for Deadly damage apply (p. 115, SRII).

If a decker is using a "cool" deck, lethal black IC acts the same as non-lethal black IC and causes Stun damage. (See Cyberdecks, p. 85, for details on "hot" and "cool" decks.)

Cybersushi, who has Body-4 and Hardening-1, is rummaging around a Red-8 system when he runs into a black IC-10 program. The IC attacks him and hits, scoring 2 successes on its Attack Test. We won't worry about what happens to the icon-Cybersushi has enough troubles of his own. The 2 successes stage up the Damage Level from Serious (S) to Deadly (D). Cybersushi takes a 10D hit from the IC! His Hardening reduces the Power of the damage to 9. With only 4 Body dice, Cybersushi is not thrilled by this benefit. He adds 4 Karma Pool dice to the Body dice for the Resistance Test and achieves 2 successes, which stage down the Damage Level to Serious. Close call. Cybersushi fills in 5 boxes on his Physical Condition Monitor. Meanwhile, the IC rips his icon into junk logics and takes complete control of his icon bandwidth. On its next action, the IC whacks Cybersushi again. Now his icon is down, so the IC's rating is up 2 points, to a 12! It scores 1 success this time, so Cybersushi has to resist 12S damage, which his Hardening-1 reduces to 11S. Good luck, Soosh.

#### Permanent Effects

Any Deadly wound may produce permanent aftereffects (see p. 113-114, SRII). This rule applies to damage caused by black IC as well. In addition to the permanent damage listed in SRII, these aftereffects may include neurological damage that produces memory lapses, hallucinations, tremors, phantom pain, migraines, or similar conditions. In the case of neurological damage, the gamemaster may devise his own rules for the long-term effects-perhaps cannibalizing the rules from Cybertechnology for the TLE and CCSS syndromes-or permanently reduce the decker's Intelligence Attribute by 1.

#### NON-LETHAL BLACK IC

Non-lethal black IC functions in the same manner as lethal black IC, with the following exceptions. First, non-lethal black IC causes Mental, not Physical damage. Deckers resist such damage with Willpower Tests. If damage from non-lethal black IC renders a decker unconscious, the decker's Matrix connection is automatically broken. However, the non-lethal black IC still gets a final shot at the cyberdeck's MPCP and the data downloaded during the run. In addition, non-lethal black IC works the same on both "hot" and "cool" cyberdecks. Mental damage done by non-lethal black IC can overflow into the Physical Condition Monitor.

#### PSYCHOTROPIC BLACK IC

Psychotropic black IC functions in the same manner as nonlethal black IC, with the following exceptions. When a decker jacks out or is rendered unconscious by damage and dumped, he makes a Willpower (Psychotropic Black IC Rating) Test to determine if the IC program caused lasting psychological trauma. Reduce the target number by 2 if the decker is using a cool cyberdeck.

If the test succeeds, the decker suffers no psychological effects. If it fails, the IC implants its psychotropic effect in the decker's mind. These effects may vary widely, but a few of the commonest ones are described below. Creative gamemasters may devise numerous delightful variations on these themes as they wish.

See Recovering from Psychotropic Effects, p. 50, for information on recovering from the various effects of psychotropic IC.

##### Cyberphobia

Cyberphobia is a profound fear of the Matrix, decking, and all related concepts. Any character afflicted with cyberphobia must make a successful Willpower Test against the rating of the psychotropic IC that caused the phobia before he can jack into a system. Also, add the IC's rating to the target numbers for all tests the character makes when decking, programming, working with hardware, you name it. As a rule of thumb, the phobia affects any task involving computers or the Matrix.

Drugs or spells inducing fear-free responses, tranquilizers, and the like may reduce the phobia penalty by up to half. Adrenal conditioners with endorphin analogues are the best bet. These drugs are only mildly addictive, cost 25 nuyen per rating point and are available without prescription up to a rating of 4. A dose lasts for about a day. Once medicated or under magical treatment, a decker suffering from cyberphobia can begin recovering.

##### Judas

The so-called Judas effect is a subliminal compulsion to betray one's self and one's colleagues. A decker suffering from the Judas effect leaves clues, both in the Matrix and the real world, that lead to his location or reveal the identities of his colleagues. An afflicted decker is not aware, however, that he is doing this. To simulate the effects of the syndrome, the gamemaster may simply lie about tests made to defeat trace IC programs or increase the decker's target numbers in such tests by a penalty equal to the rating of the psychotropic IC program that caused the Judas effect.

The afflicted character simply performs other roleplaying actions without any conscious awareness. For example, if someone were to ask the decker if he was the one who scrawled the samurai's commcode on the corporate office's front door with hot maroon lipstick, he would really believe it when he said "No". He'd even beat a lie-detector test. Make a secret Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test for the character whenever he is about to perform a compulsive act that would betray himself or others. If the test succeeds, he resists the compulsion. (However, all this is subconscious and the decker has no idea what his mind is up to.) If the test fails, the decker carries out the compulsive act with an effective Stealth Skill Rating equal to the rating of the psychotropic IC that Infected him. If another character is present when the decker performs a compromising act, make an Intelligence (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test for that character. If the test succeeds, the other character notices the decker's actions. The same test applies to any character monitoring the decker on a Matrix run or reviewing logs of his runs. If the decker's companions detect his condition and prevent him from acting out his compulsion, he may begin recovering from the effects.

##### Matrix Maniac

A decker infected by Matrix maniac IC recovers consciousness In a maniacal state of rage. He may attack persons at random, flee in howling terror, gibber, rant-you name it. In combat, the decker fights no-holds-barred, firing weapons full-auto if he can, using his nastiest weapons in physical combat, and so on. This state lasts until the decker is killed or knocked out. However, the state resumes when the decker regains consciousness. A foolishly over-kindly gamemaster may allow the character to make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test every 24 hours to see if the decker finally wakes up in a non-psychotic state of total exhaustion (though the Matrix-maniac conditioning might be designed to produce periodic maniacal states, of course).

Magic or drugs may suppress the rage and allow the character to recover. Tranq patches (p. 250, SRII) or equivalent medication with a total rating equal to the psychotropic IC's rating suppress the rage for 24 hours, whether they knock the decker out or not. Control Thought or Control Emotion spells (p. 156-57, SRII) also can be used.

##### Positive-Conditioning Psychotropic IC

Positive-conditioning psychotropic IC (PCPIC), more commonly known as "I love-the-company" IC, is not truly black IC because it does not harm the decker. PCPIC compels the decker to jack out, rather than damaging him. Use the usual rules for black IC, but the decker has to make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test to avoid voluntarily jacking out. If the decker has taken damage, apply a target modifier based on the character's Damage Level (+1 for Light damage, +2 for Moderate damage, +3 for Serious, and +5 for Deadly). The character repeats the test every turn after the IC hits, so it's only a matter of time before the decker is forced out of the system.

Once the decker has jacked out, he may make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test to negate all subsequent effects of PCPIC. If the test fails, apply a +2 target modifier to all tests the decker makes when he performs actions that might harm what he perceives as the best interests of the company or other group or individual that employed the psychotropic IC. This involves not just Matrix actions ("steal data from them? Never!") but anything else ("Help you break in and steal hard copy documents from that corporation? I'd rather shoot my granny."). The decker may make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test to avoid this penalty on each occasion. For actions that normally do not require a test (such as deciding to Infiltrate the company's premises illegally), the decker must make tests using a relevant Attribute (usually Willpower) against a Target Number 6.

Corporate programmers with a sense of humor have been known to Include more positive elements in PCPIC as well. These PCPIC programs not only make the decker reluctant to participate in acts against the company, but impel him to buy their products. Honestly. PCPIC may not be part of any party IC in combination with any other form of black IC.

### RECOVERING FROM PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS

Characters may recover from psychotropic IC effects by making Willpower Tests against the rating of the psychotropic IC program that infected them. A character afflicted with the Matrix maniac effect must make the test dally. For other effects, characters repeat the test weekly. If the decker is under appropriate medication or magical treatment, reduce the target number by 1. If under intensive psychotherapy, which requires the Hospitalized Lifestyle, reduce the target number by 2 (medication is part of therapy, so these bonuses are not cumulative). If kept under maintained, locked, quickened, or other spells with the desired effect, reduce the target number by an additional 1.

Recovery from PCPIC is more difficult because it involves aversive counter-conditioning (i.e., the decker has to be conditioned with graphic images showing the corporation to be utter bastards, despoiling the environment, murdering children, and the like). Raise the target number for these tests by 1 to reflect the unpleasantness of the procedure.

### IC DEFENSIVE OPTIONS

Any IC program may be fitted with three defensive options: armor, shield, and shift. Shield and shift defenses are incompatible with each other, though both are compatible with the armor option.

#### ARMOR DEFENSE

Armor defense reduces by 2 the Power of any attack against the protected IC. For example, armored IC attacked by an Attack-6M utility would make its Resistance Test against a Target Number 4.

#### SHIELD DEFENSE

The shield defense adds a -2 target modifier to all tests a decker must make to hit the protected IC in cybercombat. Combat utilities with the penetration option defeat IC shield defense automatically and do not receive the +2 penalty. However, the shield defense is extra-effective against programs with the chaser option, which must add a +4 modifier to the target number.

#### SHIFT DEFENSE

The shift defense enables an IC program to "dodge" incoming attacks. It adds a +2 target modifier to all tests a decker must make to hit the protected IC in cybercombat. Combat utilities with the chaser option defeat the shift defense automatically and do not receive the +2 penalty. However, the shift option is extra-effective against programs with the penetration option, which must add a +4 modifier to the target number.

### TRAP IC

Trap IC is IC that is linked to gray or black IC. Any reactive, white, or trace IC program can be used as trap IC. If trap IC is destroyed in cybercombat (or in the case of trace, if it finishes its location cycle successfully) it triggers the hidden gray or black IC. If the decker neutralizes the trap IC without destroying it, it does not trigger the gray or black IC, which remains hidden and inactive.

Applications, files, and slave remotes can be fitted with hidden gray or black IC programs as well. The decker triggers these programs when he crashes the protected icons or fails a System Test made to control the icon. The trapped data bomb is a particularly nasty variation of this arrangement. If a decker's test against the booby-trapped subsystem fails, the trap IC goes after him and detonates its data bomb if it locates him. Only a successful Defuse Test enables a decker to destroy both IC programs. A decker can detect trap IC by performing an Analyze IC operation against the white IC or an Analyze Icon operation in the case of some other Matrix entity fitted with trap IC.

### OPTIONAL RULES

The following optional rules describe particularly lethal variations of IC and suggest ways to combine types of IC Into even more threatening gamemaster tools.

#### CASCADING IC

When cascading IC misses a decker in cybercombat or fails to damage a decker when it scores a hit, it allocates more system resources to future attacks. Any proactive IC program may be programmed to cascade. If cascading IC misses on an attack, Increase the Security Value used for its attacks by 1 for each subsequent Attack Test. This increase is cumulative- each time a test fails, add an additional point to the Security Value. If the IC program attacks successfully but the decker resists all of the damage or otherwise neutralizes the IC's effect, Increase the IC's rating by 1 for subsequent attacks. These increases are also cumulative. The maximum Increase depends on the Security Code of the system, as shown on the Cascading IC Table. The optional cascading IC rule makes IC more dangerous for deckers. However, deckers may minimize its effects by quickly suppressing IC programs as they encounter them (see Suppressing IC, p. 40).

##### CASCADING IC TABLE

| System Security Code | Maximum Increase                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Blue                 | 25 percent of original rating or 2, whichever Is higher. |
| Green                | 50 percent of original rating or 3, whichever is higher. |
| Orange               | 100 percent of original rating or 4, whichever Is higher |
| Red                  | 100 percent of original rating or 4, whichever Is higher |
FastJack is under attack by a cascading Killer-5 program on a Green-6 host. Its first Attack Test uses 6 dice. The test fails, and so the next time it makes an Attack Test it rolls 7 dice. If the test fails again, the value rises to 8-which represents a 25-percent increase over its original rating, and so its maximum increase. Now, let's say the IC hits Jack but he reduces his damage to nothing. The IC's rating, which is the Power of damage, would start to cascade. Because the IC is a Killer-5 program on a Green host, its rating may increase by 2. So, if FastJack is "lucky" in early exchanges with the IC program, he will eventually find himself facing the equivalent of Killer-7 on a Green-8 host!

#### EXPERT IC

In Matrix 2.0, expert IC may be used to increase the attack rating or damage-resistance rating capabilities of proactive IC programs and Matrix constructs (both of these ratings are based on the host/grid's Security Value-see IC Ratings, p. 40). However, increasing one rating reduces the other automatically. For example, using the expert modification to increase the attack rating of an IC program by 3 would reduce the program's damage resistance rating by 3. The expert modification may Increase or decrease ratings by 1 to 3 points. For an Expert Offense-2/Blaster-5 IC program on a Red-6 host, the Attack Test would use 8 dice (Security Value of 6 + expert modification of 2). The gamemaster would roll only 4 dice for any Damage Resistance Tests made for the IC.

#### CONSTRUCTS

A construct is a gamemaster-designed icon that consists of two or more IC programs combined in a Matrix "critter". Constructs should display cunning, using nasty tricks and tactical smarts. To reflect this, constructs may have Threat Ratings (p. 187, SRII). On Green systems, construct Threat Ratings may not exceed 1. On Orange systems, these Threat Ratings may not exceed 2. On Red systems, Threat Ratings may not exceed 3. Constructs on Blue systems may not have Threat Ratings. Threat dice may be added to all tests except Initiative rolls. Threat Ratings may make constructs too dangerous for satisfying game play, especially with beginning deckers, and so gamemasters may skip giving constructs Threat Ratings in their games. On the other hand, even beginning deckers should have the sense not to get into systems that are likely to contain constructs.

##### Building Constructs

Constructs provide an excellent way to create protected forms of reactive IC. To do so, simply pair a reactive form of IC with a proactive form. Any IC program may be included in a construct.

A construct's capacity is equal to twice the Security Value of the IC's parent host or grid. The combined ratings of the IC programs in the construct may not exceed its capacity. No single IC program may have a rating greater than two-thirds the host/grid's Security Value, rounded up. So, on a host with a Security Value 8, a construct can hold IC programs with combined ratings of 16 points. No single program in the construct can exceed 6, which is two-thirds of 8, rounded up.

Gray IC programs consume an additional point of capacity. For example, a Blaster-4 would use 5 points of a construct's capacity. Black IC uses 2 extra points. Constructs may be assigned armor, shield, and shift defensive options as well (see IC Defensive Options, p. 50). Each option selected uses up 2 points of the construct's capacity. So, If a construct with a capacity of 16 was fitted with the armor and shift options, the construct would have 12 points left over to divide among IC programs.

##### Constructs in Cybercombat

Constructs are always proactive, because building a construct with no proactive components offers no advantage. A construct can attack any available target In cybercombat, using any one of its available programs. Resolve attacks against the construct as if it were a single icon. A construct has a single Condition Monitor. Fill that in, and the whole thing crashes-all its programs stop running.

As with individual IC programs, constructs use the host/grid's Security Value when making Attack Tests and Damage Resistance Tests. The ratings of the individual IC programs are used to determine their effects only. Constructs can use combat maneuvers as well (see Cybercombat, p. 121). When designing a construct, the gamemaster should determine its basic combat approach: stand-up-and-slug; sneaky, popping in and out of detection; going for killer positions in Matrix dogfights; and so on. Some corps tend to consistently choose certain behaviors for their constructs. Ares constructs use lots of maneuvering and tactical trickery. Aztechnology loads its constructs with powerful IC programs designed to overcome opposition by brute force. A construct's Initiative is based on the lowest rating of all its component IC programs. (See Cybercombat, p. 120, for details.)

#### PARTY IC

Party IC consists of a cluster of independent programs that work cooperatively to destroy the decker. Unlike constructs, the component programs of a party IC cluster do not form a single icon. A decker dealing with a three-piece cluster of party IC would have to defeat each piece separately. However, party IC differs from individual pieces of IC in several ways.

First, any proactive IC program in a party IC cluster suffers a penalty on its Attack Tests because the host is dividing its attention among the programs. Increase the target number for all Attack Tests made by party IC programs by the number of programs contained in the party IC cluster.

Second, party IC programs are harder to hit because they surround the decker's processing space with rapidly shifting target addresses. Increase the decker's target number to hit any component program in the party cluster by the number of IC programs in the party cluster. Combat utilities with the area effect option defeat this feature, however, and the penalty does not apply to tests made with such utilities. These modifiers continue to apply even if the decker crashes one of the component programs of the party IC.

##### Building Party IC

Every party IC cluster has a capacity equal to twice the host/grid's Security Value. The combined ratings of the party cluster's component IC programs may not exceed this capacity. As with constructs, treat the capacity as a pool of points used to "buy" IC programs.

The maximum number of components in a party IC cluster is equal to half the Security Value. Non-IC component programs may have any rating. All the options available for individual IC programs are available for party IC. Each option added to a party IC cluster consumes 1 point of the cluster's capacity.

#### HOST SHUTDOWN

If IC programs and constructs fail to stop an intruder, a host computer may shut Itself down completely to dump the decker. Unlike a decker-initiated Crash Host operation, a host shutdown Involves a number of steps, such as gracefully terminating running programs, transferring controls to back-up systems, closing files to avoid damage, and so on.

Hosts begin the shutdown procedure when the decker reaches a predetermined Security Tally threshold. (Typical thresholds for different hosts appear in Matrix Hot Spots. p. 149). When the shutdown threshold of a host is reached, the gamemaster rolls 1D6 for every 2 points, or fraction thereof, of the host's Security Value. For example, the gamemaster would roll ID6 for a host with a Security Value of 1 or 2, 2D6 for a host with a Security Value of 3 or 4, and so on. The result of the roll indicates the number of Combat Turns the host's shutdown sequence will last. In addition, the gamemaster should roll ID6/2, rounding fractions up. The result of this roll indicates the final warning"turn.

Once the shutdown sequence begins, make a secret Sensor Test for each decker in the system. Make these tests at the end of each Combat Turn against a target number equal to the number of Combat Turns remaining in the shutdown sequence. Continue the tests for each decker until one succeeds. At that point, that decker knows that the host Is in shutdown mode, but not when it will go. Whether or not deckers have detected the shutdown, Inform all deckers in the system that the shutdown sequence Is in progress when the sequence reaches the final warning turn, and tell the deckers how many turns remain before final shutdown.

The host actually shuts itself off at the end of the last Combat Turn in the sequence. Any decker online when the host shuts down is dumped and may suffer Dump Shock as a result. All frames and other programs the decker has running crash. Ongoing and monitored operations (see System Operations, p. 110) terminate as well.

\> \> \> \> \> [Constellation? What is this, astronomy or comp sci?) \<\<\<\<\< -Bendix (19:47/12/05-13-56)

We have developed the following algorithm under the Cooperative Constellation IC model, developed in the Pueblo Corporate Council as part of a joint effort by a consortium of leading software development houses.

\> \> \> \> \> [Oh, that must be the fancy name for party ice. Never mind.j \<\<\<\<\< -Bendix (19:48:01/05-13-56)

The development environment was a Mitsuhama Yoritomo mainframe with Security Value benchmarked at 10. We then tweaked the code under VM emulations at Values of 8 and 6. Performance remained within the parameters documented in the evaluation summary in the full document.

The short-form code index of the basic implementation follows 

| Host Security Value | 6          | 8        | 10       |     |
| :------------------ | :--------- | :------- | :------- | --- |
|                     | Trace-4*   | Trace-6° | Trace-5" |     |
|                     | Probe-2    | Probe-4  | Probe-4  |     |
|                     | Killer-5   | Killer-6 | Killer-6 |     |
|                     | Tar Baby-3 |          |          |     |

*All trace code is offensively augmented with onboard expert system code, with offense oriented optimization and reciprocal defensive recalibration. On a host benchmarked at Security Value 6, this means an effective rating of 8 during the location cycle. with a damage-resistance rating of 4. All values +,00085 subject to extended floating point adjustment in the pulse transports for the host's system command compilers. See appendix lic for detailed projections of efficiency issues in ported code.

\> \> \> \> \> ( "Offense-oriented optimization and reciprocal defensive recalibration?" Combating IC is easy compared to decoding this drek.) \<\<\<\<\< -Nailer (18:58:12/05-12-56)

\> \> \> \> \> (What it means is, if it gets at you, you're fragged. If you're swift enough and get the first strike in, you can take it down easy. Honestly, don't you people get an education these days?) \<\<\<\<\< -Plughead (21:49:31/05-12-56)

\> \> \> \> \> (Education is being taught not to write drivel like that ) \<\<\<\<\< -Noller (23:12:12/05-12-56)

This particular configuration is designed for execution when intrusion is suspected but not confirmed. The killer program is activated in the following circumstances:

- Tar baby captures a utility.
    
- The trace completes its location cycle and isolates an illegal jackpoint. In that event, the killer program becomes aggressive, applying the -1 combat efficiency parameter to its attack instructions, due to the lock on the intruder icon's jackpoint.
    
- A relocate program is used on the trace component.
    

Naturally, as cooperative elements in a program constellation, the Level 6 and 8 implementations suffer a +3.0 adjustment to success probabilities, and the Level 10 version suffers a +4.0 adjustment. Against intruding Icons on Orange-to-Red-range security systems, these inefficiencies are compensated for by baseline success probabilities. We project a target value of 7 to 9 on a Red-10 mainframe, for example, though low-trace intrusion routines would have a proportionately greater chance of avoiding detection.

##### Iconography

The constellation is programmed to take its sensory cues from the operating system, defaulting to UMS in the absence of specific sculpture code. The initial commercial implementation was in a medieval Japanese metaphor, with the trace component manifesting as a hunting falcon, circling throughout the hunting and location cycles and swooping when it verifies the jackpoint's address. The killer program was an armored samurai guard, and the probe program appeared as a mounted daimyo watching the falcon from a hillside. In the Security Value 10 implementation the tar baby program manifested as a hidden ninja icon, which leapt Into view and tried to snatch away utility icons from the intruding deckers.

\> \> \> \> \> (Oh, is THAT what that was? Nasty, I fired off a relocate at the bird and this fraggin' ninja popped out of nowhere. Almost got my relocate code, and before I could whack it, I'm playing kissyface with this fraggin' guy in samurai armor swinging a slotting big sword. And every few cycles this hooplace on the hill's snappin' this little thing like a flyswatter, makin' all kinds of noise. By the time I polished off the samurai, two more pieces of IC were scrambling on me, and the ninja had grabbed my relocate and exploded. I barely got out with my hoop in one piece.) \<\<\<\<\< -Mr. Wonderful (23:16:06/05-14-56)

#### 2. ZEUS-II Combat IC Construct

[NAME DELETED], Renraku Data Security Division We got a new ZEUS-II construct that's really wizzer. Y'see we applied some of the Series 9 Gamma logics to try and get better integration coefficients for construct-oriented IC. The MITM proceedings for summer '55 had some way-cool object holocode protocols that we thought should make for .... uh ... OK, look, it's all in the high-level design summary, OK, so look at that when you have a minute. It's really elegant, OK?

\> \> \> \> \> (Oh Ghost, Renraku let Terrible Tony out of the programming section ) \<\<\<\<\< -ExREN (02:40:47/05-14-56)

\> \> \> \> \> (Who?) \<\<\<\<\< -NeonFighter (06:11:59/05-14-56)

We ran up this implementation in a skunk works project on the HONE-8. After the prototype got stabilized, we did a set of regressions down the series from Security Value 10 to 6. Take a look at the object summary ... 

| Host Security Value: | 6         | 8         | 10        |     |
| :------------------- | :-------- | :-------- | :-------- | --- |
|                      | Armor     | Armor     | Armor     |     |
|                      | Acid-4    | Acid-6    | Acid-8    |     |
|                      | Blaster-4 | Blaster-6 | Blaster-8 |     |
|                      | Cascade   | Cascade   | Cascade   |     |

See? See what we did? We got two defensive options in, and then we threw in an acid program to weaken the decker icon before the construct blasts the guy off the nets and fries his deck and everything. And if the construct runs into problems it starts cascading, like it doesn't matter which program it is, anything loaded into the construct core can cascade, whether it's the acid or the blaster, and, and the poor bozo won't know what hit him, really!

\> \> \> \> \> (Yes. Tony. Very clever, Tony. Take your medication, Tony.) \<\<\<\<\< -ExREN (02:43:44/05-14-56)

There's some really unique metrics in the acid/blaster cascade calls, with interaction to drive the tactical decision table as to when to let go with the big hit. Y'see we found some transaction decoding methodologies in the last report on competitive techniques we got on \<\< DATA DAMAGED: 2.1 Mp Corrupted\>\>. OK, I guess I'm not supposed to tell you about that. The guys from \<\< DATA DAMAGED: .003 Mp Corrupted\>\> will probably recognize their stuff anyway when they look at the code logs-really good stuff, guys.

##### Iconography

Our main sculptor got this really great idea. I think he used to do some stuff for Olympian, before he got straight and joined Renraku, and so the construct appears in this stream of thunderclouds. It looks like some big old guy, a god or something he says, and the rain from the cloud is the acid, OK, and it eats away at the persona code until ZEUS is ready to use blaster, then it throws this really big lightning bolt, and it's really mind-fragging how that looks on the ASIST-there's a recording of the sense Impressions in the appendices, so tap that.

#### 4. Positive-Orientational Cumulative Conditioning Following Successful Psychotropic Neural Implantation

Dr. Werner Shallis, Transys Neuronet Psychotropic Laboratories Transys Neuronet, Edinburgh, Scotland, UK

Legal considerations have compelled responsible corporate concerns to Innovate developments other than aversive and phobic conditioning for dealing with the recidivist computer criminal. Transys Neuronet has played a pioneering role in such research and has recently completed two series of trials with captive experimental populations on positive psychotropic conditioning effects.

\> \> \> (This means they got their hands on a bunch of imprisoned deckheads and fragged their brains. So much for "legal considerations "J \<\<\<\<\< -Slater (16:25:19/05-17-56)

Effects replicated in both experimental series include the standard phenomenon of positive response conditioning towards icons and images associated with Transys Neuronet, and a new experimental finding: that of cumulated conditioning. Psychotropic implantation was oriented toward engendering ongoing conditioning toward corporate imagery, and the data show an increasingly exclusive pattern of positive organismic responses occurring only with respect to such images. These data suggest that exciting possibilities now exist for marketing (Note: Copy to Marketing Division) corporate products following psychotropic implantation. Pre-existent data on neural and behavioral plasticity suggest that such conditioning procedures might be further optimized if they could be undertaken with younger experimental subjects.

\> \> \> \> \> [This might explain something. A friend of mine has certain, ah, personal difficulties. He finds it increasingly difficult to sustain a "positive organismic response" without an icon of Transys glowing on the wall ] \<\<\<\<\< -Brewer (21:11:15/05-17-56)

The therapists managed to figure out that putting a vacuum cleaner under the bed did the job, the association with the roar of the aircraft engines being enough to get the right response back. It's a simple effect: after all, for males there is virtually no difference in their physiology between states of sexual arousal, anger, and fear. It's called the 3F syndrome and the first two are "fight" and "flight.". The pilot-thing was a conditioning of arousal to environment-now Transys's psychotropics condition arousal to an icon.

--
Under Matrix 1.0, the majority of matrix systems used the UMS, the Universal Matrix Specifications (p. 167, SRII). Only a few systems had the overhead processing costs for creating custom, or "sculpted," systems. In Matrix 2.0, the increased availability of next-gen hardware and enhanced optical-code processes have made sculpted systems increasingly common. Some system-design houses still work in the UMS, but they are a dying breed.

In game terms, the Matrix 1.0 system layouts required detailed mapping. Deckers saw the specifics of the local Matrix or private matrices as they went from node to node. Under Matrix 2.0, no fixed maps exist for hosts. When speed is of the essence, the gamemaster and players can simply declare their actions, System Tests, IC attacks, and other pleasantries without considering the appearance of the Matrix at all.

### SYSTEM ACCESS NODES

In Matrix 2.0, system-access nodes (SANs) connect host computers to grids and to each other, just as they did in Matrix 1.0. When a decker performs a Logon to Host operation from the grid or from a dedicated host connection, he enters the SAN icon for the host he is invading. The gamemaster needs to decide-in advance or on the fly-to which LTG a host with open access is attached. Similarly, if the host can only be accessed from a PLTG or via host-host access, then the gamemaster needs to make that choice. (See p. 169, SRII, for more guidelines on these rules.)

### SECURITY SHEAVES

A security sheaf describes the security measures in place on a host or grid as well as how the host/grid reacts to intruders. Quite simply, a sheaf consists of a list of trigger steps. These steps represent security tally thresholds. As a decker's security tally reaches each trigger step, the system activates one or more IC programs. Trigger steps also activate the various alert levels in a system. The alert status of the system, in turn, affects the types of IC programs the system activates. The security code of the host/grid determines the frequency of trigger steps in a system, and the gamemaster determines the events activated by each trigger step. Gamemasters may use their own discretion or random generation to determine these events.

#### TRIGGER STEPS

As noted above, trigger steps consist of specific security tally numbers. Whenever the security tally of a decker reaches or exceeds one of a system's trigger steps, the system automatically activates one or more security measures, such as IC programs or alerts. Low-security systems, such as Blue hosts, maintain few trigger steps-as a result, they have fewer IC programs and other security measures. High-security systems, such as Red hosts, set trigger steps in small increments, and so they have more IC programs and security measures.

A system's security sheaf lists the system's trigger steps and indicates the events triggered at each step. The Sample Security Sheaf Table depicts a system that activates a Probe-5 IC program when a decker's security tally reaches 3. When a decker's security tally reaches 7, the system activates a Trace-7 IC program, and so on.

##### SAMPLE SECURITY SHEAF TABLE

| Trigger Step | Event                                                      |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3            | Probe-5                                                    |
| 7            | Trace-7                                                    |
| 10           | Killer-8, Passive Alert                                    |
| 13           | Party IC: Expert Offense 2/Acid 6, Killer 6/Armor/Shifting |
##### Multiple Triggers

If a decker performs several actions on a system that together add a large number of points to his security tally all at once, the increase may cover two or more trigger steps. In this case, the indicated events for ALL the triggered steps that have been reached or exceeded occur at once (otherwise known as "the drek hits the power supply").

#### ALERTS

After determining the intervals of the trigger steps for a system, the gamemaster chooses the IC programs and security measures activated by each trigger step. In order to determine an appropriate level of response for each trigger, however, the gamemaster must first determine the timing of the system alert. All systems have three alert statuses-no alert, passive alert, and active alert. The normal status for all systems is no alert. Specific trigger steps activate passive and active alerts. The alert status of a system determines the types of IC programs that go into action at the system's trigger steps.

##### No Alert

Generally, trigger steps under a no-alert status activate reactive IC or trace IC programs.

##### Passive Alert

In a typical security sheaf, the third or fourth trigger step activates a passive alert. Passive alert means that a system suspects an intruder has Invaded it, but is not 100 percent certain. Under passive-alert status, trigger steps typically activate proactive white or gray IC programs. Reactive IC tends to be trapped or part of a party IC cluster or combat-capable construct. When a system goes on passive alert status, Increase all Subsystem Ratings by 2.

##### Active Alert

A typical system goes on active-alert status on the second or third trigger step after the system goes to passive alert. Active alert means the system has verified the presence of an illegal Icon. Under active-alert status, trigger steps typically activate proactive and sometimes black IC programs. Trigger steps may also activate corporate or law-enforcement deckers in the system, and the system console operators may initiate a system shutdown.

Once a system reaches active-alert status, running away and sneaking back into the system become much more difficult for Illegal deckers. Security personnel know that someone has been snooping around, and the system managers remain particularly vigilant for some time to come. This will lead to a very slow host reset (see Host Reset, p. 65).

#### RANDOM IC ALLOCATION

The following tables provide a system for using dice rolls to randomly generate IC programs for the trigger steps of a security sheaf. Gamemasters who choose not to use the random-generation system may still find these tables useful as guidelines for allocating IC programs. Table entries for low dice roll results can be used for relatively easy systems and entries for higher dice rolls used for more secure, hostile systems with data really worth protecting.

Special pieces of nastiness (notably worms) do not appear in the tables. The gamemaster should use these as special features of vicious systems that provide stiff challenges to deckers. To use the random-generation system, first roll 1D6 for each trigger step and consult the appropriate column of the Alert Table. At the No Alert and Passive Alert levels, add the number of trigger steps that have already been passed at that alert level to the roll result. If the result indicates a type of IC-such as Reactive White, Proactive Gray, or Black-proceed to the appropriate IC table to determine the IC program at the trigger step. If the result indicates a move to a higher alert level, for the next die roll result consult the column for the higher alert.

After rolling on the Alert Table, move to the appropriate IC table. Roll 1D6 or 2D6, as indicated on the IC Table, to determine the specific IC program assigned to the trigger step. After determining the program, roll on the IC Rating Table to determine the rating of the IC program. Then consult the IC Options and IC Defenses tables and make the indicated dice rolls to determine the options and defenses the IC program carries.

Gamemasters may modify the results from these tables depending on the Matrix system defending against the intruder. For example, black IC is significantly more likely to be encountered in an Aztechnology system than a Renraku system.

##### Constructs and Party IC

Under a no-alert or passive alert status, constructs and party IC clusters typically include trace or probe programs, with combat IC or a tar program to provide cover. Under active-alert status, constructs and party clusters usually carry substantial offensive IC programs. (See Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 52, for more information on constructs and party IC.)

The random-generation system enables a gamemaster to generate a security sheaf in advance or on the fly. The latter may prove especially useful when a player-decker invades a system unexpectedly during a game.

For example, say that John invades a host rated Orange-7/11/14/13/14/13. Samantha, the gamemaster, has not prepared a security sheaf for the system, so she rolls 1D6 + 2 with a result of 1. She consults the Trigger Step Table, which indicates a +2 modifier for a result of 1 on an Orange system. Now she knows that the first trigger step for the system is 3.

John logs on, racking up 2 points to his security tally in the process, then fails an Index Test, which raises his security tally to 4-past the trigger step. Time for something to happen, so Samantha rolls 1D6 for a result of 4. She consults the Alert Table; no alert is in effect on the system, so this means John encounters proactive white IC. Samantha consults the Proactive White IC Table, rolls 2D6, and achieves a 7-that means the IC is a killer program. Next she goes to the IC Ratings Table and again rolls 2D6, for an 8. The system has a Security Value of 7, so that means the killer IC has a Rating of 8. Now Samantha rolls 2D6 on the IC Defenses Table and scores a 7, so no special defense is in play. However, she rolls a 12 on the IC Options Table. Bad news for John, he's just run into a Cascading Killer-8 IC program.

John crashes the IC in cybercombat. Samantha rolls again and consults the Alert Table to determine when the next trigger step occurs. Her 1D6 + 2 roll yields a 2. She adds the +1 modifier for Orange systems and determines that the next trigger step is 6 (3 + the previous trigger step).

On the next turn, John runs into real problems and his security tally rises to 9. This is 3 points past the next trigger step, so Samantha rolls on the Trigger Step Table again to determine if he has triggered two steps. She rolls 1D6 + 2 and gets a 1. She adds the +1 modifier for Orange systems and comes up with a 2. That sets a trigger step at 8. Between the first trigger step and his current security tally, John passed two trigger steps, at 6 and 8.

##### CAVEATS

Sometimes the random-generation system will produce a result that flunks a reality check. For example, a host won't launch a trace program if it has already located the decker's jackpoint. A mom-and-pop Blue host won't have black IC. Or the decker might not have any chance at all against the IC the tables summon up (assuming that this bothers the gamemaster). In these and other cases, the gamemaster may modify the results as he sees fit.

Gamemasters may also wish to adjust randomly determined IC ratings to better match the decker's defensive resources. The decker uses the rating of an IC program as his target number for Damage Resistance Tests when taking damage from IC, so the gamemaster needs to consider how the decker's defenses will change the "raw" IC rating. Once armor or similar persona defenses reduce the target numbers for the decker's Damage Resistance Tests, he could easily take 2 or 3 points of damage and survive. Results of 4 or 5 are more difficult to survive, and a result of 6 virtually guarantees the decker will take significant, if not fatal, damage.

#### HOST RESET

If a decker logs on to a host, raises nine kinds of havoc, jacks the host up to within a hair of shutting down and then logs off, he can't expect to hook back into that computer five minutes later and find that all is forgiven and forgotten. Undoubtedly, the host will still be running IC programs and other security measures. Before jacking back in, the decker will want to wait until the host "decides" to reduce its alert level, deactivate running IC programs and in general get back to work. That process is known as a host reset.

Blue systems reset completely in 2D6 minutes, during which time the host deactivates security measures and the security tally drops to 0. More secure hosts do not reset as quickly. Green, Orange, and Red hosts reset after 3D6 minutes, provided the decker did not trigger a passive or active alert in the system. If a decker triggers an alert on a Green, Orange, or Red host, the system resets even more slowly. Roll 1D6 every 5 minutes for Green hosts, every 10 minutes for Orange hosts, and every 15 minutes for Red hosts; Reduce the system's security tally by the result. Any IC program left running when the decker logged off remains running until the security tally drops below the trigger step that activated the IC.

If any decker logs on to the host illegally before it finishes Its reset, his security tally begins at the level the security tally had dropped to when the intrusion occurred.

Selena invaded an Orange host and raised its security tally to 18 before she logged off with a killer IC program and a construct both lusting for her chitlins. The system then began a host reset. Half an hour later, when Cybersushi logs onto the same host, the system is still resetting. Its security tally stands at 6. During Selena's run, the host went on passive-alert status at trigger step 5, so the system remains on passive alert. The killer IC activated at 12 and the construct at 16, so both of these programs have shut down.

### WHAT HOSTS DO

Host computers do not exist just to provide playgrounds for deckers. When designing a host for use in a game, think about the function the host serves in the "real world"-what data resides on it, what processes it controls, and the like. The host's primary function in turn determines if and why a decker would invade the host, and his likely goals when doing so.

#### PAYDATA

Virtually all host systems contain datafiles. The vast majority of these files offer nothing of any relevance to shadowrunners, but some contain information that may be quite valuable in the marketplace or may answer crucial questions. This information is called paydata. Paydata can be new technology from the big brains in R&D, business plans worth money to inside traders or competitors, Incriminating information ripe for blackmail-anything with value on the black market that exists for secret data. Gamemasters may determine for themselves the exact nature of any paydata contained in hosts in their games and roleplay character's attempts to sell it on the black market. Alternatively, gamemasters may use the following random method for determining paydata and its value.

Deckers must use Locate Paydata operations (see System Operations, p. 115) to locate paydata. Guidelines for retrieving paydata appear below.

##### Paydata Points

The paydata random-generation method uses Paydata Points to measure the value of paydata. Characters may fence all Paydata Points for the same amount, whether they retrieve the data from a single file on a high-security system or from hundreds of Mp of trash files on less dangerous hosts.

A host's security code determines how many Paydata Points Its files contain. Less secure systems contain fewer Paydata Points, and more secure systems contain more points. The Paydata Points Table shows the dice rolls used to determine the amount of Paydata Points on a system.

As stated above, deckers must download files to retrieve Paydata Points. The size of each file is determined by its data density, which varies according to the system's security code. The Paydata Points Table provides dice rolls for determining the data density of files on a system.

##### PAYDATA POINTS TABLE

| System Security Code | Paydata Points | Data Density |
| -------------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| Blue                 | 1D6-1          | 2D6 x 20 Mp  |
| Green                | 2D6-2          | 2D6 x 15 Mp  |
| Orange               | 2D6            | 2D6 x 10 Mp  |
| Red                  | 2D6 + 2        | 2D6 × 5 Mp   |
Gus logs on to a Green host and performs a Locate Paydata system operation. Charlie, the gamemaster, consults the Paydata Points Table and rolls 2D6-2 to determine how many Paydata Points the system contains. He rolls a 5, so the system contains 3 Paydata Points. Gus achieves 2 successes on his Locate Paydata operation, so he locates 2 of the Paydata Points. He decides to download the worthwhile files. Charlie again consults the Paydata Points Table to determine the data densities of the files containing the paydata. For the first Paydata Point, he rolls 2D6 for a 6. He multiplies that by 15 and finds that Gus has to download a 90 Mp file to get the first Paydata Point. For the second point, the gamemaster rolls again and scores 12. So for the second point, Gus has to haul down a 180 Mp file. The decker decides the paydata is not worth the effort and logs off.

##### Paydata Defenses

Generally, host operators do not leave paydata files lying around unprotected. On Green, Orange, and Red systems, paydata files may be linked to data bombs, scramble IC, or other defenses. The gamemaster may design such protections himself or roll 1D6 and consult the Paydata File Defenses Table to determine the defenses attached to paydata files on a system.

##### PAYDATA FILE DEFENSES TABLE

| System Security Code                                                            | No Defense | Data Bomb | Scramble IC | Other* |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------ |
| Green                                                                           | 1-4        | 5         | 6           |        |
| Orange                                                                          | 1-3        | 4         | 5-6         |        |
| Red                                                                             | 1          | 2-3       | 4-5         | 6      |
| _*Per gamemaster discretion. Data bomb plus scramble may be used as a default._ |            |           |             |        |
##### Fencing Paydata

The base street price of a Paydata Point is 5,000 nuyen. However, the final price generally varies, as stolen paydata must be fenced like any other stolen property (see p. 188, SRII, for rules on fencing loot). Deckers must move fast when selling stolen paydata. The black market changes very quickly indeed, and today's hot info is old news tomorrow. To reflect this condition, reduce the decker's stock of Paydata Points by 1 for each day it remains unsold. (This reduction does not apply to specific files invented by the gamemaster as part of the adventure. Mr. Johnson's prices are usually set in advance, and the time-sensitivity of such files depends on the story.)

##### The Nature of Data

For randomly determined datahauls and gamemaster-designed datahauls, design paydata that fits with the nature of the system being raided. When dealing with megacorporate systems, the gamemaster may find the corporate profiles in the Corporate Shadowfiles sourcebook helpful. For example, that book describes the Fuchi megacorp's major areas of interest as computer engineering, computer science, Matrix security, and fiscal operations. Logically, paydata retrieved from a Fuchi system will likely be related to one or more of these areas. From these bare bones, the gamemaster may improvise. For example, a decker who snatched valuable paydata files from a Fuchi system may possess information that shows Fuchi has been surveying the costs of developing Matrix security software. Fuchi's competitors, such as Renraku, would probably be very interested in such information. The Corporate Shadowfiles entry on Renraku describes the firm's high level of interest in both Matrix security and fiscal operations -- so the idea fits quite well in the SR universe. In this manner, the Corporate Shadowfiles profiles also can help the gamemaster identify likely buyers for specific paydata.

Other SR sourcebooks provide background information for other corporations. For example, the SES corporation (Tir na nÓg) might possess parabiological datafiles. Cord Mutual (Neo-Anarchist's Guide to North America) would store data relevant to insurance, and the proprietors of Stuffer Shack™ would keep huge wedges of data on toxic and addictive food additives and the like.

Obviously, some systems, especially public-access systems, may not contain data of value to anyone. Keep in mind, however, that appearances may be deceiving. For example, the archival files of the Royal Armories of the Tower of London contain loads of cross-indexed entries on the development of German plate mail armor in the sixteenth century and similar subjects. Such data is hardly likely to earn the decker any funds. However, the Tower of London has a gory and intriguing history as well-the bodies of more than 1,500 executed persons, mostly nobles, lie buried beneath the stones of its small chapel. Who can say what politically devastating files might be found within the hosts of the Tower network?

##### Excessive Paydata Rewards

The random method for assigning Paydata Points allows deckers to make money when they need it. Unfortunately, some player character will inevitably discover that he can spend days on end doing nothing but cracking Green systems and hauling out enough paydata to become a millionaire by Friday. The gamemaster has numerous options for preventing this.

First, corporations and governments pay particular attention to repeat offenders. They expect and even allow a certain amount of data theft from their systems, but if things get out of hand they send out investigative agents and nail the source of the problem with unmatched efficiency. Corps even cooperate to identify habitual criminals who spread out their thefts across numerous companies. The increased corporate/government heat fueled by such deckers will most likely rack off other deckers as well. They'll quickly notice that someone is spoiling the biz for everyone. They'll find out the name of the culprit from fixers and fencers and they'll respond.

Finally, deckers who accumulate large amounts of nuyen quickly attract the attention of other people, many of whom will immediately begin devising ways to relieve such a decker of his loot. When the decker realizes that his over-enthusiastic thieving is being matched by a similar rise in the number of burglaries and muggings he suffers, not to mention thefts from his own bank balances, he may see the advantage of limiting his efforts.

The gamemaster may also counter excessive greed by enforcing optional rules (especially those on Multiple Improvements and SOTA) to greatly Increase the decker's need for money.

#### SLAVE SYSTEMS

A host's slave subsystem handles any remote devices controlled by the host. Slave subsystems control a wide range of remote devices and systems, including automated vending machines, site-security controls, hospital medical systems, automated factories and laboratories, air- and ground-traffic control systems, power grids, telecommunications, and so on.

Gamemasters should determine whether a slave subsystem needs to be operated from a central host, and whether that host needs to be connected to the public grid. The UCAS Air Traffic Control net, for example, consists of a series of Orange and Red processors running in a Host-Host configuration over a government PLTG, with no direct connection to the public nets. An automated factory, on the other hand, needs to order components and materials, update Inventory databases, process orders, dispatch transport, and otherwise operate as part of a business. As a result, the hosts involved in running a plant must be accessible from the public grid in some way. Very sensitive controls will almost certainly be on dedicated processors, with Orange or Red security levels, buffered from invasion behind chokepoints, tricky SAN designs, and layers of IC.

##### Security Remotes

Typically, corporations and other organizations use slave subsystems to operate the physical security infrastructure at a site. During a shadowrun, while samurai and magical assets go in on the ground, one or more deckers invade the host that controls the site's cameras, security doors and maglocks, alarms, and so on. The decker uses the Locate Slave operation to find the controls for a given security device and then employs the Control Slave or Edit Slave operations to take it over or suppress its alarms. Another common decker trick is to use the Monitor Slave operation to eavesdrop on secret meetings over the very systems intended to protect such meetings.

##### Factories and Labs

To manipulate an automated factory, laboratory, or any similar process, a decker must possess a skill in how the process works or an expert system that provides that skill for him. For example, say a decker is altering the way an assembly line makes cars. This may be a subtle sabotage job, where the manufacturer is being set up to produce lemons, or a complicated piece of equipment stealing (after making a high-performance set of wheels, the decker is going to have it delivered to a neutral fixer and fudge the accounting records to make the vehicle look paid for). The decker needs to use Ground Vehicle B/R skill, or Automotive Engineering, to give the right commands to the slave subsystem. See the Control Slave operation for details (System Operations. p. 111).

#### APPLICATIONS

Applications are legitimate host programs that lack Matrix "intelligence" or direct user control. Application programs include spreadsheets, document processors, analytical programs, database search programs, and dumb-terminal sessions. Sabotaging an application, as opposed to simply crashing it, Is a subtle mission. First, the decker must duplicate the program. Then he must alter the program so that it does whatever he has in mind: launch a frame at the appropriate moment, report findings, fake output data to give bad conclusions or crocked results, and so on.

Assume that standard business applications have a design size of 1D6 x 50 Mp, and scientific or industrial applications have design sizes of 2D6 x 50 Mp. Double the size of applications that handle very complex processes or operations (stock market analysis, complex factory procedures, advanced scientific research, and so on).

To duplicate and alter such programs, a character must use a mainframe computer and possess a relevant skill. The character combines the relevant skill with his Computer Skill and uses the average of the two skills to make a test to perform the task. For example, a decker would make a Computer/Physics Test, using the average of his Computer and Physics skills, to rewrite a program to support or sabotage a physics research project. A team can use the highest skills of any of its members for such tasks. Skillsofts or other expert systems may be employed as well. Deckers must use an Edit File operation to upload the new application program to the target host and place it into the file containing the original application program.

### UMS AND SCULPTED SYSTEMS

In the Matrix, what you do determines where you are. A decker who succeeds in a Logon to Host operation on a grid moves into the host's SAN. Logging on from a workstation would put him in what Matrix 1.0 called an I/O port. If a decker makes an Index Test to locate something, he is in the addressing tables for the computer-an SPU or even the CPU under Universal Matrix symbolism (UMS). A Files Test would move the decker to a datastore or I/O port, a Slave Test to the slave node that controls the device in question, and so on.

On systems that use UMS icons, the gamemaster can describe the results of a decker's tests in terms of movement to the various nodes, even though detailed mapping is no longer required. A user in the Matrix can, in effect, reach any node from any other node by performing the appropriate operation. Location and description become matters of game color and atmosphere, not necessity.

The same concept applies to sculpted systems. However, unlike UMS systems, sculpted hosts possess a central metaphor, and all or most of the things the decker experiences conform to that metaphor.

#### CHOOSING A METAPHOR

Sculpted systems use custom-designed imagery rather than UMS icons. The megacorps started the trend and still maintain the highest levels of virtual reality and detailed design. However, more and more non-corporate systems, even the grids in places like Tir na nOg, are acquiring at least some level of distinctive sculpture.

The central metaphor of a sculpted system defines the virtual reality of the system. When designing a simple sculpted system, choose a concrete name for its principal image: Office Complex, Castle, Amusement Park, Egyptian Palace, and so on. Complex systems? All limits are off. The Denver Datahaven is a flashing model of a fantastic solar system orbiting a massive black hole. The Mitsuhama Pagoda contains virtual villages where application icons toil patiently in the rice paddies of a cybernetic medieval Japanese milieu, and sensitive data is stored In fortresses that make Osaka Castle look like a kiddy toy.

Simple or complicated, the gamemaster should pick a metaphor he can have fun with. Don't worry about accuracy in historical or literary settings. Designers in the film and sim industries have been putting zippers on medieval gowns for at least a century. Ninety-nine percent of Matrix sculptors go for what looks chill, not what matches the history books. Naturally, if the gamemaster is personally wiz at, say, Victorian London, then the most realistic sculpted system in an adventure might happen to recreate the milieu of Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper. In any case, the metaphor should capture the gamers' imaginations, and suggest images that fit the commonest System Tests and system operations.

Hosts in a linked network, certainly sharing host-host access, usually share the same metaphor. Keep in mind that these metaphors are usually intended to make day-to-day work easier and more intuitive for the people who use these computers.

#### EFFECTS OF SCULPTED SYSTEMS AND REALITY FILTERS

When a decker logs on to a sculpted system, everything he does or senses is explained in terms of the system's central metaphor. He has to act as if the metaphor were his reality. If his icon is in a virtual corridor, for example, he cannot walk through the walls. If a decker insists on describing his actions in terms that do not conform to the system's central metaphor, apply a +2 modifier to all target numbers for tests he makes in the system.

System sculpture can slow down deckers whose MPCP Imageries, or reality filters, do not conform to the system's central metaphor. The gamemaster determines whether this happens. If the decker's icon doesn't fit the metaphor on the sculpted system, the decker rolls an MPCP Test against the system's Security Value. If the test fails, he loses 2 points from his Reaction and 1D6 of Initiative as long as he remains within the sculpted environment. (System sculpture can extend over linked hosts in a network, even over an entire PLTG and its attached hosts, so the decker may suffer the penalties for quite a while.) If the test succeeds, his filter dictates the system architecture during the run, and his Initiative bonus for using the filter remains intact.

#### MAPPING SCULPTED SYSTEMS

In Matrix 2.0, formal system maps, like the UMS diagrams used under Matrix 1.0, are unnecessary. Gamemasters need only note, either on paper or mentally, the appearances of the main subsystems. For example, ScreamDream Productions, a simsense studio that grinds out wildly popular horror adventures, has sculpted its headquarters host with a Haunted House central metaphor. The system is full of characters and settings from ScreamDream sims. Logging on, one walks through a mist-covered front yard, as vague voices mutter at the edge of comprehensibility all around you. When you knock on the massive, Victorian front door, the lumbering butler from _Blood of the Goblins_ opens it and demands the passcode.

The great central hall is modeled after the site of the final massacre in _Revenge of the Living Corpses_. From the hall, stairways and passages wind off in many different directions. Searching for a file leads to the extensive library upstairs, where poisonous spiders guard sensitive file pointers, and a secret door leads into an old dungeon (from the horror-comedy _Catacomb Crawlers_) where deadfall traps, animated skeletons, and shambling horrors await the decker who carelessly rifles through the executive datastores down there. The studio complex's security cameras feed images through the hundreds of mirrors in the _Hall of Madness_ from _Reflections_, and the slave subsystem that coordinates the simsynths used in post-production is accessed through a Rube Goldberg pipe organ from _Phantom of the Opera Meets Godzilla_.

That's the way to "map" a sculpted system-not with lines and boxes, but with scribbled notes or just a vivid and slightly askew imagination and a fun metaphor.

**Logging on to the Mitsuhama Pagoda** That week the Pagoda SAN was over in LTG-8206. I ran in a datalink from out in the hills south of Rainier. Good shot south to the geosynch comsats from there. I had a sensitive deception program I got from one of Geyser's pet coders, good on the satellite vendor's security, so that wasn't a big deal. I swapped it for my normal spoor code before I hit the Seattle RTG.

Seattle telecomm was the usual pushover. I didn't really start feeling pressure 'till I locked onto the Mitsuhamo SAN address. The sculpture kicks in as you trigger the logon interrupts. One tick, I'm swooping through the gridlines, all UMS drek on the grid, y'know. The next, I'm riding along a tan-painted-wood road toward a pagoda, carrying chains you see in the chanbara. Most of 'em probe in user icons, walking in and out of the castle. Then I hear a clack-clack-clack and a guy runs by in full samurai armor, yelling something. Everyone gets outta his way, and my sensors ID it as a priority-access data packet accessing the SAN.

Now it's my turn. I don't even think of trying my own reality filter-house-to-house in a desert war don't match with samurai-land, s'right?. As it is, my MPCP stutters and my timers have to cycle slower so I stay synched to the commlink, so I know my icon. is being dragged deeper into Mitsuhama's reality. I ride with the flow and run up my deception program as the guardian icon of the access routines steps in front of me and holds up a hand. My logon operation went smooth as silk. I was in a samurai robe myself, and by the look and feel, my deck was telling the SAN that I was some corp exec type. It bowed way low, and the gate swung open.

Inside, the main fortress reared up in the distance-s'funny you can't see it from outside the gate, but inside, it's the biggest thing on the horizon. A main road ran towards it, but I wasn't going that way today. I looked around, trying to find what I needed by looking through the index code for the subhost I'd accessed. My visual sensors finished interrogating the network's interprocessing addresses and I saw a new road-hadn't been there a second ago-branched off through a mess of farmers working in fields full of water. Office workers, singing some kind of work song. Sounded a lot like the Mitsuhama corp anthem you get on their cable-access station ID spots.

I walked past the farmers and saw some kind of temple, lots of people coming and going. If my browse program had it right, this was the access point to the subsystem for Fuchi Med Systerra where the data I was after was located. I joined a bunch of pilgrims-I think they were e-mail packets from another division-and tried to blend in, but a tough-looking pair of monk warriors headed my way. Oh well, too much to hope for getting all the way in without some kind of argument from the local IC. \<\<\<\<\< -X-Register (20:08:39/02-12-56)

**SIX-GUN FILEHANDLERS**

I was inside the desk clerk logs for the Nikko Downtown. They hadn't cleared them yet, but the records for March were due to consolidate Into their Tokyo headquarters tonight, so if I didn't get the data I was getting, I'd have to crack down on the corporate HQ computer, which would make this regional net look like a pushover. Biggest hotel chain In Japan, so their sculpture is right out of a Hollywood western. Go figure. I have an MPCP cooked with cowboy stuff-it's a popular sculpture motif, so I'd slipped it into my deck when I heard what Mr. Johnson wanted.

I rode into town, accessed the Index router and found myself in a saloon knocking back some really crude "root beer" with a barkeep about folks passing through. I finally figured out that the phone logs were in the telegraph office. I moseyed on over there, I had to deal with a barroom brawl. I think the two tough guys were killer IC programs. I had to relocate the piano player, because that's where the trace IC was stashed. I'll give the sculptor points for a sense of humor-the relocate iconography translated into picking the icon up and slamming its head into the guts of an authentic player piano.

When I punched up my filecrackers I found myself walking along the railroad tracks, busier than any nineteenth-century train yard ever was, as large-frame data packets thundered past, looking like old steam locomotives. Spooled data bellowed and mooed in the cattle pens by the roadbed. I wished then that Nikko couldn't afford such good sculptors-they'd included an olfactory track.

I needed the secure phone logs from the executive suites. The ones hotels aren't supposed to maintain, showing comm-codes accessed, time stamps, and that kind of thing. I had no need to know, so Mr. Johnson hadn't told me, but I was willing to bet that the corp footing my bill suspected one of their sales managers was talking to people he shouldn't be. All I knew for certain was that I was supposed to spool a copy of the logs for a particular week and then wipe the data for the whole month.

I knew I was in trouble when I ran an Analyze Icon operation on the telegraph office and a pile of papers blew away, revealing a heavy safe. A second Analyze Icon op gave me a clue I didn't want; a lock on the files rating for this store, running the subsystem up a couple of steps in processing power. Scramble IC wrapped around the contents of that safe, rigged to wipe it if I blew the operation. I could hear the tick of a data bomb inside it, ready to blow if I succeeded.

I pulled out a big drill, muscle-powered to fit the metaphor, and tried working my way into the filespace to defuse the bomb. The bit kept slipping, so I knew the CPU was cranking the flags Indicating probable intrusion higher and higher. That concern turned into an immediate threat when a big icon in a serge suit, with a scatter gun in its hands and a tin star on its chest, kicked open the door and took a shot at me. I was an unhappy cowpoke as I pulled a stick of dynamite out of my pocket-a decrypt program to match the safe motif of the scramble IC. I ducked behind the desk, avoiding another blast from the shotgun, and lit the fuse, triggering the DINAB on the decrypt. I tossed it at the safe as I pulled my six-gun and plugged the sheriff IC. It fell as the safe blew open and I decided the drek with it and grabbed the satchel of telegraph forms out of the safe. The resulting blast as the data bomb blew sent me sailing out of the telegraph office.

I started stuffing the papers into my saddlebags, triggering the download process, when I heard jingling spurs coming down the street. He was dressed in black, two-gun rig riding low on his hips. I scanned him-yup, a hired gun indeed, a corpdecker. I stepped away from my horse-the telegraph flimsies still fluttering on their own from satchel to saddlebag-and we faced off. Overdone sense of drama on some programmer's part. It was after 0200 PST but somewhere a clock began striking noon. We both went for our guns on the last stroke of the bell. \<\<\<\<\< -Mirrorman (19:02:42/04-02-56)

**LOADING FOR BEAR**

The Azzie corpheat were leaning hard on Cement Bear's tribe in the Barrens, and they were short on weaponry to fight back. I owed Bear a debt after the way he'd patched me up last year, and I thought it'd be poetic justice to even the odds a little at Aztechnology's expense. I hit the Azzie PLTG through a San Diego sales LAN. As the office decor faded into the Awakened jungles of the Yucatán, something paced me through the trees-spots, teeth, claws, jaguar motif. I flipped out a relocate program, which turned into some kind of deer. The IC took off after it, maybe trapped, maybe just sculpted to scare the drek out of gullible deckers.

Flocks of brilliantly plumed parrots flapped along the datastreams. I sidestepped a big fraggin' serpent that hissed a warning and scanned the squawking icons until I spotted an inventory transaction heading for the weapons production plant up here in Seattle. I followed it to a SAN off the private AZT grid. One of those darn pyramid temples, surprise surprise.

The IC guarding the stairs to the top of the pyramid looked nasty. You can tell a little about the IC on these sculpted Azzie systems. Simple cotton padding for armor says it's pretty mild IC. If it's dressed in jaguar skins or has an eagle headdress, be as chill as you can. IC that dresses like the top-ranked Aztec warrior castes, the Eagle and Jaguar knights, is usually dark gray or worse.

I reached the top of the temple pyramid, where a giant mirror of glistening obsidian gave off a dense cloud of smoke-I think it was an SPU handling addressing redirects, since I ended up in front of it as I started probing the software, looking for the controls on a production line I could use. An image swam into view in the mirror and firmed up: I stepped through the obsidian and into a goldsmith's. With flint and obsidian tools, a line of careful artisans worked gold into machined parts, and the parts into solid gold carbines. Cute image. I'd chipped a gunsmith skillsoft before I jacked in, so I could make the adjustments I wanted. I found the craftsmen who produced the sear assemblies, and guided their hands in a new pattern, then worked up the tolerance on the bolt, and half-a-dozen other adjustments. Instead of the Atlatt sporting model, the factory this slave node controlled was now turning out the mil-spec AK model it's based on.

I needed 100 of the weapons-about an hour's production. I killed a few seconds writing a nice, fully paid order to the sales database. A pictographic scroll formed under my hands as I finished coding the update, and a courier, wearing the emblems of a minor court official, ran up to carry it off as I finished. Hoping I would get all 100 rifles before the host caught on, I settled into a wait state and hoped I'd get through the null ops OK. \<\<\<\<\< -Runs-In-Circles (17:32:54/05-09-56)

If you jack In at the office and juggle databases, you're a wriggling little user. If you get Into what makes the pretty icons work, you might become a programmer, a much higher form of life. But unless you punch deck till your fingers bleed and your neurons melt, unless you bet your brain to get a microsecond's advantage over IC as black as hell, you're no decker.

We can define the numbers that define the decker. In this section, we do just that. But only the players can provide the attitude that turns a technonerd with a megayen worth of computing gear into a decker.

### ATTRIBUTES

The Mental Attributes rule, as far as most deckers are concerned. After all, Intelligence is crucial to the Hacking Pool. While Body may be important when resisting damage from black IC, the new biofeedback ICCM technology (see Cyberdecks, p. 86) lets deckers disregard Body and depend on their Willpower. Enough Quickness for a decent Reaction value is useful, but frankly, most hot deckers depend on their decks, not their meat, for speed. The only Mental Attribute not essential to decking is Charisma. Some deckers say this reflects and continues a time-honored tradition (and stereotype) of brilliant nerds with no time for social trivia like empathy, relationships, self-awareness and that kind of drek.

### SKILLS

The Computer Skill Is ESSENTIAL for deckers. Its Software Concentration includes the Decking Specialization, but beginning deckers will suffer if they increase skill in Decking at the expense of programming ability. The maximum rating of the programs that characters can design equals the rating of their Computer (or Software, or Matrix Programming) Skill. The ratings of character-designed MPCP and frame cores may not exceed the character's Computer (or Software, or Matrix Programming) Skill multiplied by 1.5. The Hardware Concentration Is not as important as the aforementioned concentrations. Computer B/R is the skill for building decks. The Hardware Skill comes into play if the decker is designing basic components, rather than bashing stock parts into his deck.

The Etiquette (Matrix) Skill governs searches for equipment, software sources, local access to Shadowlands, and other goods and services. This skill also keeps the decker current on who the major players are in cyberspace and lets him pick up the latest rumors in the global gossip of the Matrix. Gamemasters should not overlook this skill. Use it to determine whether a decker gets hot goss on who's got goodies that might be useful to him (great new software, contacts, paydata Info) and more besides.

### THE PERSONA

The persona, the decker's online Icon, is defined by the MPCP and BEMS ratings of the deck (see Deck Ratings, p. 16, In Matrix 2.0), and by the deck's special options, such as Response Increase. The final measure of the persona's processing power is the utility programs loaded Into the deck during a run. The following two sections, Cyberdecks and Programs, provide rules for designing and constructing the hardware and software that make up the cyberdeck, and the persona it generates. This section discusses the basics of what the programs do, and the decisions the decker must make when he is loading his deck.

#### THE MPCP

The master persona control program (MPCP) is the operating system of the cyberdeck. It runs on a dedicated processing chip and is the central component of the cyberdeck. The MPCP is the heart of the circuitry that supports the other persona programs, like the motherboard in a regular microcomputer. In addition to performing its technical functions, the MPCP defines the persona's appearance. On a legitimate terminal, it carries the so-called Matrix signature. Every time a user logs on to a system, edits a file, or touches a control system, a logging function in the MPCP writes a record of the user's signature, timestamp, and a code indicating what the user did into the system.

Cyberdecks, almost by definition, do not possess Matrix signatures. Deckers illegally "stealth" their MPCPs and fit them with illegal masking chips. But each MPCP is subtly different from every other, and these differences give each MPCP a distinctive appearance in Matrix Iconography. Some deckers are paranoid enough to continuously tinker with their icon, radically changing its appearance on a regular basis. Others accept the inevitable and maintain the same look rather than endanger their precious "edge" by undermining their sense of identity in the nets.

Characters rarely use the MPCP in tests. The two principal exceptions are rests measuring the stability of the icon program on a sculpted host (see Effects of Sculpted Systems and Reality Filters, p. 69, in Mapping Matrices) and when the deck itself is under attack by gray or black IC (see Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 38). All the other programs on the deck, both persona programs and utilities, execute under the MPCP's control. Therefore, the MPCP Rating determines the maximum ratings for these subordinate programs. The total ratings of the four Persona programs cannot exceed the MPCP Rating x 3. No utility can have a rating greater than the deck's MPCP. (See Deck Ratings, p. 16 in Matrix 2.0. for more Information.)

#### PERSONA PROGRAMS

The latest piece of Matrix slang for persona attributes is "BEMS," for Bod, Evasion, Masking, and Sensor. These four qualities measure the effectiveness of the persona in cyberspace.

##### Bod

Bod measures the stability of the character's icon- its resistance to error, logic attacks, and other cybernetic attacks. A high Bod Rating is important for deckers who like to solve problems via cybercombat.

##### Evasion

Evasion measures the agility of the Icon-its ability to maneuver in cybercombat and escape the attentions of trace IC. Evasion is not generally installed on most cyberterminals, unless they are designed specifically for cybercombat. Not the kind of feature you find on an office worker's desktop.

##### Masking

Masking measures the ability of an illegal icon to avoid detection. This attribute is especially important when resisting the system Security Tests that oppose the decker every time he makes a System Test. Typically, Masking programs are not Installed on legal cyberterminals. Investing in excellent Masking Is arguably the sign of a decker who knows what he's doing.

##### Sensor

The Sensor attribute controls the icon's perception of cyberspace and measures its ability to process data. The attribute may be used for ad hoc Sensor (System Security Value) Tests to notice changes in the host computer, such as alert states, IC activations, and so on.

### OPTIONAL RULE: DECK MODES

Under the optional Deck Modes rule, cyberdecks are in one of five modes at all times- default mode, bod mode, evasion mode, masking mode, and sensor mode. Each mode has distinct effects and confers specific bonuses and limitations. Switching between modes requires a Complex Action, and decks may be In only one mode at a time. When Increasing or decreasing values under the deck modes rule, round up all fractions.

Generally, substantial disadvantages counterbalance the advantages gained by using any deck mode. Throughput loss makes this especially true for the evasion mode. For this reason, deckers may wish to reserve deck-mode switches for special circumstances. For example, a decker might choose to switch to evasion mode when he identifies the presence of trace IC in a system gone to passive alert.

#### DEFAULT MODE

In the default mode, all deck ratings remain at their base values.

#### BOD MODE

In bod mode, the deck's MPCP allocates resources to resist damage. The Bod attribute increases 50 percent. The Evasion, Masking, and Sensor attributes are reduced by 50 percent each. The deck's I/O bandwidth is reduced by 50 percent as well. That is, if the decker has 100 Mp of total bandwidth allocated, he only gets 50 Mp of throughput (throughput is the actual speed of data over commline). See Cyberdecks, p. 90, for bandwidth rules.

#### EVASION MODE

Typically, deckers use evasion mode to avoid trace IC and enhance the combat maneuvers of a deck. Evasion mode Increases a deck's Evasion attribute by 50 percent. Bod, Masking, and Sensor are reduced by 50 percent, as is the deck's bandwidth throughput.

#### MASKING MODE

Masking mode increases the deck's Masking attribute by 50 percent. The deck's Bod, Evasion, and Sensor attributes are reduced by 50 percent. Bandwidth throughput is unaffected.

#### SENSOR MODE

Sensor mode improves the persona's ability to detect changes in the host environment, as well as the ability to counter combat maneuvers. Sensor is increased by 50 percent. Bod, Evasion, and Masking attributes are reduced by 50 percent. Bandwidth throughput is unaffected.

### DECKERS AND TASKS

Tasks follow the same pattern whether they involve hardware or software. (See Cyberdecks, p. 81, and Programs, p. 94, for details on designing and constructing hardware and software.) All tasks require a base time, usually measured in days. Most important, every task requires a Success Test (specified in the description of the task) to develop the basic design of the program, circuit, or whatever. The base time divided by the number of successes from the test equals the number of days in the task period. The task period is the actual amount of time it takes the decker to finish the task.

If the Success Test fails, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and divides the base time by the result. Round fractions up in this instance. The result equals the number of days of work that the character must put in on the task before discovering that the design is irretrievably flawed and that he must begin again. Task bonuses, defined below, apply to this work. The gamemaster should make these Success Tests secretly, so that only he knows the actual task period and the success or failure of the attempt. Alternatively, the gamemaster may have the players make a number of Success Tests In advance and use the results when the player attempts tasks.

#### TASK BONUSES

Each task requires minimum tools and resources. Without these required tools, the job cannot be done at all. With them, one day of work, defined as 10 hours of uninterrupted labor at the job, reduces the task period by one day. Gamemasters should resist the blandishments of players who claim their deckers can put in a 15-hour day thanks to excessive intake of caffeine and the latest meditational exercises.

In some cases, superior resources may grant a bonus to the work rate. A +1 task bonus means that one day's work reduces the task period by 2 days. A +2 task bonus reduces the task period by 3 days for a day of work, and so on. Rules for specific tasks, presented In subsequent sections, note which tasks may be shortened with task bonuses.

#### FINISHING TASKS

Characters may complete tasks in parts, rather than in single unbroken efforts. For example, a character attempting a task with a 20-day task period may perform 5 days of work, go off on an adventure, do another 10 days of work, work on another task, and then do 5 more days of work to complete the task.

#### HEALTH AND TASKS

Characters suffering from Light wounds may work at tasks unimpeded. Characters suffering from Moderate wounds may perform tasks, but they have only half their normal productivity. A character with a Moderate wound would have to work 2 days to accomplish the 1 standard day of work on a task. Characters with Serious wounds cannot work on tasks at all. As for dead characters-well, we appreciate their spirit, but they should really take the day off.

#### OPTIONAL RULE: SOTA

Tech doesn't stand still. The deck that cracked a mainframe wide open last month might not even get past the SAN today. To stay on the edge, a decker has to stay current with the "state of the art," the SOTA. When using the optional SOTA rule, the gamemaster should roll 2D6 and consult the SOTA Table at the end of each adventure.

##### SOTA TABLE

| 2D6 Result | Result                                        |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 2          | Advance SOTA for MPCP and persona programs    |
| 3-5        | Advance SOTA for persona programs             |
| 6-8        | Nothing changes (must be a slow month in R&D) |
| 9-11       | Advance SOTA for utilities                    |
| 12         | Advance SOTA for MPCP                         |
##### SOTA FACTOR

When the SOTA advances, deckers must spend money, time, and/or Karma Points to keep the specified software or hardware current (see Maintenance Costs for details). The rating of any component that is not maintained drops by 1 point. This is not a permanent loss. The decker has to upgrade the program or component per standard rules to restore its original rating. The program size stays the same, even though the rating has dropped (obsolete code is usually bigger than equivalent current code).

The SOTA Factor measures the amount of maintenance required to keep all programs and hardware current. If the MPCP advances, the SOTA Factor equals MPCP Rating x 2. If persona programs advance, the SOTA Factor equals the sum of the BEMS ratings. When utilities advance, add up the ratings for any utilities for which the decker has the source program. Divide that sum by 2, rounding up. Add the ratings for any other utilities without source code. The total sum is the SOTA Factor.

Why not just include programs and components in progress in a tally? Don't count the same program twice when computing the SOTA Factor. For example, if a program is both a utility and a frame component, its rating is counted only once.

Selena has Computer-6 and an MPCP-8/6/6/6/5 deck. She has utility ratings totaling 86 points, but her source code accounts for only 49 points of that sum. If the MPCP advances, her SOTA Factor is 8 x 2, or 16. If her persona programs advance, the SOTA Factor is 24. If both the MPCP and persona programs advance, her SOTA Factor is 16 (MPCP x 2), plus 24 (sum of BEMS ratings), for 40. If the utilities advance, take 49 ÷ 2, rounded to 24 (utilities with source code), plus 37 (other utilities), for a total of 61.

##### LIFESTYLE AND SOTA

A decker who maintains a High or Luxury lifestyle receives "automatic" maintenance for his gear and programs. High lifestyle reduces the SOTA Factor by 25 percent. Luxury lifestyle, by 33 percent. Round fractions down. Middle lifestyle or lower does not offer this SOTA advantage.

##### MAINTENANCE COSTS

Deckers can pay for their SOTA maintenance costs with skill, money, or Karma Points. First, the decker rolls a Computer (MPCP Rating) Test to maintain the MPCP or persona programs. For persona programs, characters may use the Hardware Concentration or Interface Tech Specialization. For utilities, the Software Concentration or Matrix Programming Specialization may be substituted. For every success, reduce the SOTA Factor by the rating of the skill used for the test.

Remaining points in the SOTA Factor may be paid off with money at 500 nuyen per point. Alternatively, a decker can spend Good Karma to reduce the SOTA Factor. Each point of Good Karma reduces the SOTA Factor by the rating of the decker's Computer Skill or the relevant concentration of specialization. However the decker chooses to pay off his or her SOTA Factor, he must pay before the next game or suffer the specified penalties. The decker also may pay off only part of the SOTA Factor and decide what components to leave out of the calculation. Any equipment not upgraded at this time suffers the specified penalties.

Selena must pay off a SOTA Factor of 61 to maintain her utility programs. Her deck has an MPCP Rating 8, so she makes a Computer (8) Test. She achieves 2 successes, so she reduces the SOTA Factor by 8 × 2, or 16 points. Her SOTA Factor is now 45. She spends 4 Karma Points to reduce it by another 24 points, to 25. But now there's a problem, Selena only has 10,000 nuyen to spare for the SOTA. That means she'll be able to pay off all but 5 points of the SOTA Factor. Selena may leave 5 points worth of object-only utilities or 8 points of source code utilities unpaid. She has a Cloak-5 (no source code) she hasn't used much lately, and so drops it from the SOTA Factor. That program drops to Cloak-4.

Gamemasters may wish to adjust the frequency of SOTA Factor increases depending on the game. If a decker is working constantly, monthly SOTA Factor increases may not be desirable. Instead, the costs may come due every three months or so. The SOTA rule is recommended for gamemasters who have a problem with over-wealthy decker characters. The rule enables gamemasters to extract excess nuyen from such characters and prevent them from buying every advantage a decker could want.

--
The key to the decker's art, the cyberdeck, is an extremely powerful microcomputer with a highly specialized instruction set. Its processing power is dedicated to Implementing the ASIST Interface that converts the decker's neural impulses into the programming instructions that bend the Matrix to his will. This section provides rules for constructing and buying cyberdecks. In Matrix 2.0, deck buyers are not restricted to the "off-the-peg" decks of the original SR rules. Now, buyers may purchase modular units that allow a decker to select the components and capabilities of the deck. Of course, such decks cost big nuyen, and where's the pride in it?

The section is divided into three main parts: Constructing Decks, Tools and Parts, and various subsections on the components of a deck. Constructing Decks provides a general explanation of deck construction. Tools and Parts provides information on the tools and parts needed to build decks. The component subsections provide information on each component and rules for Installing or assembling the component.

### CONSTRUCTING DECKS

All cyberdecks contain certain components, such as an MPCP, persona programs, an ASIST Interface, active memory, and storage memory. Without these components, a deck simply will not work. The components are assembled in a series of tasks that may be performed by the decker himself or a cyberdeck technician. I/O speed is so vital that it is almost mandatory, but theoretically a decker can make a run without it if no significant data transfers are Involved. All other components, no matter how useful they may be, are optional.

#### TASK DESCRIPTIONS

All of the component entries in this section contain task descriptions. These descriptions provide the ratings, tests, and other game values involved in producing or upgrading that particular component. Tasks are divided Into three types: Software Tasks, Cook Tasks, and Installation Tasks.

##### Software Task

If a component requires a program, the program's effective rating and size multiplier are listed in the Software Task heading. These values are used in the programming task (see Programs. p. 100). To construct a cyberdeck, a decker must obtain a custom-programmed or off-the-shelf object copy of the software before he can do any work on the component's hardware.

##### Cook Task

Software such as MPCPs, persona programs, and support code for programs such as Response Increase are all permanently written onto "firmware" chips, also known as optical-code chips (OCCs). All other components that require software use OCCs as well. Characters may purchase preprogrammed OCCs from an outside source-one they literally trust with their lives-or they may encode software onto OCCs themselves by performing Cook Tasks.

All Cook Tasks require the use of an optical-chip encoder. Encoders are described in Tools and Parts. Cook Tasks have base times and cook times as well, which are described in each component's Cook Task description. Additionally, every Cook Task requires a Computer B/R Test. The target number for the test is supplied in the component's Cook Task description. OCCs and components that use OCCs may not be installed until the chips have been created with a Cook Task.

##### Installation Task

Once a decker has cooked or purchased any required OCCs for a component, he may buy any necessary parts and install the component. Each component's Installation Task description provides the base time and Success Test needed to complete the component's installation. The prices of circuitry and other parts required for installation are described in Tools and Parts.

#### CRANIAL CYBERDECKS

Characters must use cranial deck parts, not standard ones, when constructing cranial decks, or C2 decks. The Implant specialization of Computer Skill Is the appropriate skill for all Cook and Installation tasks made when constructing C2 decks. Apply a +2 modifier to all target numbers if using Computer B/R Skill for these tests instead. C2 decks also require the use of cybernetic as well as microtronic tools. For example, If the task description for a component calls for a Microtronics Shop, the task would require a Cybernetics Shop as well If the decker is constructing a C2 deck. See pp. 54-59, SRII, for more Information on cranial cyberdecks.

### TOOLS AND PARTS

Once a character purchases tools, he may use them for various tasks. For example, a decker may use an optical-chip encoder to cook any number of OCCs-he does not need to purchase a new one to make new chips. However, parts are consumed when the task is performed. Once the job is done, the parts have been turned into a piece of the cyberdeck. Characters must purchase additional parts to perform additional tasks.

#### TOOLS

Microtronics tools are required for all cyberdeck construction, both external and cybernetic. These tools come in kits, shops and facilities. A kit is a portable supply of tools for performing basic work. A shop contains more tools and can be moved only with a large van or small truck. A facility contains bulky, heavy machinery and is immobile.

Tasks that require a small tool unit, such as a kit, may be performed with any larger unit, such as a shop or facility. In fact, using a larger tool unit than required confers a Task Bonus, as illustrated on the Tool Unit Table. Kits may not be used for tasks that require shops and facilities; shops are not adequate for tasks that require facilities.

##### TOOL UNIT TABLE

| Task Requires | Appropriate Tool Units | Task Bonus |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ---------- |
| Kit           | Kit                    | None       |
|               | Shop                   | +1         |
|               | Facility               | +3         |
| Shop          | Shop                   | None       |
|               | Facility               | +1         |
| Facility      | Facility               | None       |
Many tasks require a personal computer with a minimum memory size. This same computer can, of course, be used to write the programs for the software elements of a component. The price for a desktop unit is provided in the Tool Prices Table. (See p. 259, SRII, for prices of more compact computers.)

Optical-chip encoders use a quantum process to program OCCs. The process breaks down and reconstructs the crystalline lattice of the "raw" chip. The encoder's rating is added to the Computer B/R Skill a character uses for a Cook Task. The better encoders also provide a Task Bonus. Encoders weigh a few kilograms and are about the size of a shoebox. Once cooked, OCCs cannot be reprogrammed. Upgrading and repairing OCCs requires a whole new Cook Task.

##### TOOL PRICES TABLE

| Tool                  | Cost                 | Availability | Street Index     |

| Hitachi RM-AX         | +2                   | 9,500¥       | 10/7 days        |
#### PARTS

Each component's task description specifies any parts needed for each component. Part prices appear in the Part Prices Table. Task descriptions provide any task-related cost multipliers as well. For example, Hardening a deck requires redundant data-transport circuits, and so the DTC cost is multiplied by the Hardening Rating, squared.

Chips are rated in price per megapulse. The component task descriptions describe required chip ratings as the type of chip, at the size of the relevant program. For example, an OCC would be shown as "OCC @ program size," at 20 nuyen per Mp of program size. Circuitry is measured in Rating Points and priced per point. For example, an entry in a task description such as "PLC @ MPCP Rating" would mean buying processor-logic circuitry with the same rating as the MPCP, at 25 nuyen per point. The component task descriptions list any required specialized parts and their prices as well. Cranial components are required for C2 decks.

All parts are readily available. Even cranial components are easily available through cyberware markets. Non-cranial components are always available and have Street Indexes of 1. Cranial components have Availabilities of 4/72 hours and Street Indexes of 1.5.

##### PART PRICES TABLE

| PART                            | COST          |
| ------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Chips**                       |               |
| Optical Code Chip (OCC)         | 20¥ per Mp    |
| Optical Memory Chip (OMC)       | 5¥ per Mp     |
| Cranial OCC                     | 200¥ per Mp   |
| Cranial OMC                     | 50¥ per Mp    |
| **Circuitry**                   |               |
| Processor Logic Circuitry (PLC) | 25¥ x rating  |
| Data Transport Circuitry (DTC)  | 10¥ x rating  |
| Cranial PLC                     | 250¥x rating  |
| Cranial DTC                     | 100¥ x rating |
#### UPGRADES

Upgrades represent improvements to existing components. The Software Tasks for upgrades are based on the difference between the component's old rating and its upgraded rating. Calculate the size of the upgraded program and subtract the size of the old program to determine the amount of work involved in the task. Program upgrades are discussed in more detail in Programs, p. 107.


Characters must perform the Cook and Installation tasks for the component from scratch, using the new software rating and size. For example, a decker has an MPCP-6 deck with Hardening-4. The Hardening software is 144 Mp in size. If the decker upgrades the Hardening to 5, the new size is 180 Mp-a 36 Mp upgrade. After performing programming equivalent to a 36 Mp program, the decker performs the Cook and Installation tasks, These are based solely on MPCP-6 and Hardening-5, as if the component were being built from scratch.

OPTIONAL RULE: SALVAGE

Gamemasters may allow deckers to "salvage" 50 percent of the value of parts they replace In upgrades. This represents Income from selling outdated OCCs, old memory chips, reusing circuit logies, and so on.

MPCP

As noted in previous sections, no persona program on a deck may have a rating higher than the deck's MPCP rating. Additionally, the combined ratings of a deck's persona programs may not exceed the MPCP Rating multiplied by 3. In addition, no utility may have a rating higher than the MPCP Rating. However, the MPCP Rating does not limit the number of utilities the deck may run at any single time. That limit is purely a function of the deck's active memory size and the size of the utilities (see below).

MPCP UPGRADES

Improvements In the holographic code links under Matrix 2.0 have eliminated the older, more rigorous requirements that controlled MPCP upgrades: Characters no longer need to upgrade persona programs to match new MPCP Ratings. However, whenever a character upgrades his deck's MPCP, he also must upgrade components that have construction tasks that Involve the MPCP. These components Include the ASIST Interface, the ICCM filter, and Response Increase. Until the decker upgrades these components to match the new MPCP Rating, he cannot run his deck with both the new MPCP and the old components. He may run the deck with the older, lower MPCP Rating and continue to use the components, or he may run with his new, higher MPCP rating but without the components.

REALITY FILTERS

Reality filters Impose a metaphor on the Matrix chosen by the decker and programmed into his deck's MPCP. A decker who likes baseball can model an entire Matrix run on a hard-fought game. A decker with a taste for swashbuckling can swagger his way through the world of a cybernetic musketeer or duelist. In practical terms, a reality filter acts as an additional level of Response Increase on the cyberdeck. It Increases Reaction by 2 and adds + ID6 to Initiative. However, a reality filter also Increases the MPCP's design rating by 2. This increase affects design size and all base times, target numbers, and so on, based on the MPCP's Rating, though the real size of the program is not increased. Reality filters also reduce MPCP Ratings by 1. As a result, deckers may have to reduce their persona programs to keep them within acceptable limits (see MPCP). The decker may operate his deck without turning on the reality filter. In that case, he does not receive the Response Increase or the rating reduction. Turning a reality filter on and off is a Free Action. However, until the beginning of the next Combat Turn after toggling the filter on or off, reduce the decker's current Initiative by half and apply a +2 modifier to all his target numbers.

MPCP ICONOGRAPHY

Instead of jamming the entire Matrix through reality filters, deckers also may adapt their icon's appearance, or iconography, to fit the metaphors they are likely to encounter on a sculpted system. An MPCP program can be cooked with alterations to the Iconography If the decker has the source code. The programming changes only take a few hours to write and do not require a test, but the Cook Task requires the standard task period and components. The decker can then simply pop the new chip Into the deck's motherboard-no Installation Task is required. Deckers may maintain a library of MPCP chips, each designed to present an image that blends with a specific system iconography, and thus avoid the penalties for violating the metaphor of a sculpted system.

ACTIVE MEMORY

Active memory is the cyberdeck's "RAM," to use the old-tech term. Just as hackers in the twentieth century talked about having 64 meg of memory on their computers, a Sixth World decker refers to 100 Mp of active memory on his deck. A deck's active memory limits the utility programs the deck can run and have ready for use by the persona at any one time. A deck with 100 Mp of active memory can run no more than 100 Mp of utilities at any one time. (These limits are in addition to any limits imposed under the optional Icon bandwidth rule).

ASIST INTERFACE

The ASIST interface component controls the simsense experience of cyberspace and the decker's DNI (direct neural interface) connection to the Matrix, as routed through the interpretive software coded into the MPCP. The interface also has a control program of its own to handle the data exchange. This ain't no home sim entertainment unit. The typical signal strength on a full-bore cyberdeck is not too far below the brain-kicking current a wirehead gets from a BTL chip. That gives the decker the best interface to the Matrix, and when a deck is running ar that intensity, it is sometimes called a "hot" deck. However, a decker can deliberately reduce the intensity of the ASIST signal, down to about the level of legal simsense. This is called a "cool" deck. Cool decks can reduce the persona's speed in cyberspace, but black IC cannot inflict lethal damage over a cool Interface. Lethal black IC acts as non-lethal black IC through a cool deck. Psychotropic black IC, however, works over both levels of interface. A decker can install hot or cool ASIST circuitry. If he installs the hot circuit, he can selectively switch from hot to cool, or vice-versa, at will. However, switching Interface circuitry while under attack by black IC requires the same tests as jacking out. A cool interface can only run cool. Either ASIST Interface can be switched off entirely, which turns the deck into a "tortoise" (see Tortoises). Whenever a decker upgrades his deck's MPCP, he must also upgrade the ASIST interface. Until he does so, the deck acts like a tortoise if he runs with the new, higher MPCP, but the interface works as designed if operated with the MPCP at the old value.

CONTROL INTERFACES

A hot deck can be run without any manual control surfaces. All commands are transmitted via DNI. This enables a decker to cool down the deck during a run, but acts as another level of Response Increase, adding 2 to Reaction and + ID6 to Initiative. A deck equipped with a keyboard and a hot ASIST Interface can be run hot, cool, or even tortoise-cold. Running a deck cool, by using a keyboard and other manual controls to augment the ASIST interface, reduces a decker's Initiative by 1D6.

RAS OVERRIDE

ASIST circuitry Includes a reticular-activation system override (RAS). The RAS override suppresses sensory signals from the decker's meat body, freeing him to concentrate fully on the simsense experience of the Matrix. The RAS override also louses up any physical coordination the decker has, so apply a +8 modifier to target numbers for any Physical Tests à decker must make while jacked in. In addition, concentrating on the physical world louses up a decker's Initiative badly (see Cybercombat, p. 120). Disconnecting the RAS override dilutes the ASIST interface so badly that the cyberdeck acts like a "tortoise.".

TORTOISES

Tortoises are cyberdecks without ASIST Interfaces. They use VR goggles, holo-display screens or even flatscreens, gloves, trackballs, and other low-end tools to simulate the Matrix experience without a DNI connection. A deck without an RAS override is equally inferior. Characters can build tortoises easily and cheaply, because cost of the VR equipment is a trivial component of the MPCP price. Deckers can always switch off their decks' ASIST Interface circuitries and turn their decks into tortoises. If under attack by black IC, this counts as "Jacking out" and requires the same tests to succeed (see Black IC in Combat, p. 47, in Intrusion Countermeasures). Tortoises reduce the user's Reaction by half, rounding down, to a minimum value of 1. They can be equipped with Response Increase, but users only receive the additional 1D6 for Initiative, not the +2 modifier to Reaction.

ICCM BIOFEEDBACK FILTER

Intrusion counter-countermeasures (ICCM) technology protects deckers from the worst effects of black IC. New generation ICCM technology allows ICCM devices to be built directly into cyberdecks. An ICCM filter increases the decker's chances of jacking out successfully when under attack by black IC. Apply a -2 modifier to the target number for the Willpower (IC Rating) Test (see Black IC In Combat. p. 47. in Intrusion Countermeasures). The filter also allows a decker to make two separate Damage Resistance Tests against lethal and non-lethal black IC-one test with Body and one with Willpower. The player may choose the test with the best result to use as the character's resistance. Karma Pool dice added to the test are rolled separately and augment the chosen Resistance Test. Hacking Pool dice cannot be used for these tests. The ICCM filter is not effective against the psychological effects of psychotropic IC. However, It does buffer the decker from the physical side effects of sparky IC programs (see Gray IC, p. 43 in Intrusion Countermeasures), the same as it does against black IC. Constructing an ICCM filter requires Computer B/R and Biotech skills. The Success Tests for the Cook and Installation Tasks use the average of these skills, though two characters may Instead work as a team to perform the tasks, each contributing one of the two skills.

I/O SPEED

The input and output of a deck is analogous to the old modems that connected terminals and computers back in the dark ages of computing. The I/O speed indicates the maximum 1/O bandwidth that a decker can allocate to a task. A standard cyberterminal, whether legal or a deck, automatically and always can handle its icon bandwidth as a function of its MPCP, so the I/O speed feature only comes into play when using the optional bandwidth rule (see Bandwidth, p. 90). If the optional bandwidth rule is not in effect, all uploads and downloads are always at the full I/O speed of a deck. V/O speed must be built in multiples of 10. The maximum bandwidth value of a deck is equal to the deck's Sensor Rating x MPCP Rating x 10 Mp.

RESPONSE INCREASE

Response Increase is the Matrix equivalent of wired reflexes. Each point of Response Increase increases a persona's Reaction attribute by 2 and Initiative by + ID6. A deck can support only 3 points of Response Increase. Furthermore, Response Increase cannot exceed a deck's MPCP Rating divided by 4, rounding fractions down (so a deck with MPCP Rating 3 or below cannot sustain any level of Response Increase). In addition to the deck's 3 points of Response Increase, deckers may gain an additional point of Response Increase by using a reality filter. Furthermore, deckers running hot decks on pure DNI control may gain an additional point of Response Increase. The absolute maximum of Response Increase a deck may have is 5 points, which translates as + 10 to Reaction and 6D6 for Initiative!. Response Increase requires both programming and hardware construction. The programming task is based on an effective rating equal to the MPCP, with a multiplier equal to the Response Increase Rating multiplied by 2. For example, on an MPCP-6 deck, the software component of Response Increase-2 would require programming a 6^2 x 4 routine, a design size of 144 Mp. (See Programs, p. 100, for information on programming tasks.) This design size also affects the cost of the task, because the decker must use an OCC large enough to hold the Response program.

SATLINK INTERFACE

A satlink interface consists of a cyberdeck-mounted protocol-conversion logic and a satellite dish. High-density fiber-optic cable with built-in signal boosters connects the deck to the dish. The signal boosters enable a decker to run a signal through several kilometers of this cable without using an external signal booster. Any dish formar may be used with a deck fitted with an interface. A standard satellite dish is one-half meter across and weighs five kilograms. Large portable dishes are one meter across and weigh eight kilograms: they reduce by 1 the target number for tests to locate satellites (see Satellite Links, p. 30). Fixed-base earth stations reduce target numbers by 2. Mobile fixed-base earth stations require trucks and trailers. Characters Inclined toward a do-it-yourself philosophy may also fashion temporary satellite dishes out of spray polymer and plastic webbing. These dishes can be assembled and mounted almost anywhere, but they only last for a few hours. The electronics for a temporary dish weigh 3 kilograms and can be reused, The electronic components pack down into a box about 50 centimeters by 25 centimeters by 25 centimeters. Dish prices are provided in the Satlink Dish Prices Table.

STORAGE MEMORY

Storage memory is analogous to the hard drives on old-time computers. Any program in a deck's storage memory can be loaded onto the deck by using the Swap Memory operation. Any utilities a decker plans to use during a run must be kept in storage memory. Data for uploads and downloads can be kept in Storage Memory, or the cheaper off-line storage. The Matrix 1.0 load-speed rule, which controls the speed of data transfers between storage memory and active memory, does not apply in Matrix 2.0.

MISCELLANEOUS COMPONENTS

Certain fixed-price deck components, such as casing, hitcher jacks and vidscreens, act the same whether they are hooked up to an icepicked CyberShak cheapy that some high-school hacker is using to fix his grades or the finest product of the Fairlight labs. A deck's casing protects it from the daily bump and grind of a shadowrunner's life. If a deck is exposed to physical damage, It has an effective Bod of 1. The cost of casing is negligible when compared to the cost of other deck components. If someone wants to buy a bunch of empty casings, figure they're worth 10 nuyen apiece. Prices for other basic components appear in the Component Prices Table. See p. 73. SRII, for descriptions of hitcher jacks; off-line storage, and vidscreens.

DECKS À LA CARTE

In Matrix 2.0, deckers can order decks from manufacturers, who assemble them using components specified by the decker. The Deck Component Prices Table provides formulas for calculating the prices of these components. Each formula represents the entire cost of the component, including software, hardware, circuitry, installation-the whole nine meters. Slot your stick and the deckmeister puts this in your deck, ready to run. The formulas are derived from the cost of the component's software, chips, circuitry, and so on given in the task description. Components with software feature a Program Factor (PF), the multiplier in the price formula for software. The PF is determined according to a specific rating of the deck, called the PF basis. For example, the PF basis for a deck's Hardening is the deck's MPCP Rating. The Program Factors Table shows PFs for various ratings. For example, a MPCP-8 deck has a PF of 500 nuyen for its hardening program formula.

PROGRAM FACTORS TABLE

    Program Rating

        1-3: PF (in nuyen) 100

        4-6: PF (in nuyen) 200

        7-9: PF (in nuyen) 500

        10+: PF (in nuyen) 1,000

A decker can break prices down further, of course. For example, If he already has the object code for his MPCP, the decker needs only the OCC and installation parts. These prices can be calculated from the MPCP task description.

PACKAGE DISCOUNTS

Generally, deckers receive a 10-percent discount when ordering a complete deck (MPCP, persona chips, and ASIST interface, plus optional components and features). After a particularly lucrative run, SuzyQ decides to treat herself to a new cyberdeck. She orders an MPCP-8/6/6/6/6 deck with Response Increase-2, 480 MePS of 1/0 speed, Hardening-4, as ICCM filter, 1,000 Mp of active memory, 1,500 Mp of storage memory, and a hot ASIST interface.

The price breakdown for SuzyQ's new deck looks like this:

    MPCP: 8^2 x [(8 x 500) + 195] = 64 x 4,195 = 268,480

    Bod: 6^2 x [(3 × 200) + 95] = 36 x 695 = 25,020

    Evasion: 6^2 x [(3 x 200) + 95] = 36 x 695 = 25,020

    Masking: 6^2 x [(2 x 200) + 75] = 36 x 475 = 17,100

    Sensor: 6^2 x [(2 x 200) + 75] = 36 x 475 = 17,100

    Active Memory: 1,000 x 7.5 = 7,500

    Storage Memory: 1,500 x 6 = 9,000

    ASIST Interface: (8^2 × [(500 x 2) + 40]) + (8 x 50) = (64 × 1,040) + 400 = 66,560 + 400 = 66,960

    Response Increase: ((8^2 × 2) * (500 + 80)) + (2 x 105) = (128 x 580) + 210 = 74,240 + 210 = 74,450

    I/O Speed: 480 × 30 = 14,400

    Hardening: (4^2 x [(500 × 8) + 160]) + (4 x 70) = (16 × 4,160) + 280 = 66,560 + 280 = 66,840

    ICCM Filter: (8^2 x [(500 x 4) + 115]) + 5,000 = (64 x 2,115) + 5,000 = 135,360 + 5,000 = 140,360

Putting it all together, the deck's total price is 732,230 nuyen. With the basic 10-percent package discount, Suzy's bill comes to 659,007 nuyen. A more generous 20-percent discount would bring the price down to 585,784 nuyen.

OPTIONAL RULE: BREADBOARDING

The base numbers for deck construction assume the manufacturer is building a standard portable cyberdeck. Cyberdecks can also be breadboarded—built larger, faster, and cheaper using desktop-sized components and external black boxes. Breadboarded CPUs, which contain the MPCI, personaware, Response, Hardening, and I/O speed, weigh 10 kilograms. All other breadboarded components weigh 2 kilograms more than the standard version. A complete breadboarded deck is about the size of a twentieth-century desktop computer. When using breadboard construction, reduce the target numbers for the Cook and Installation tasks by 2 and the cost of parts by 50 percent. This same discount applies to à la carte deck building. Breadboard components are not compatible with standard decks. However, both breadboarded and standard decks run the same software, and programs developed for a breadboarded deck can be cooked into OCCs for a regular deck at any time. Similarly, the same utilities work on both types of decks. CZ decks cannot be breadboarded.

OPTIONAL RULE: COMMERCIAL CONVERSIONS

Under Matrix 1.0, deckers bought legal cyberterminals at street prices that accounted for the initial steps of conversion, such as stealthing the MPCP signature and expanding the motherboard. They kept the commercial circuitry for features like Hardening and I/O speed and added modules for Response Increase. The Matrix 1.0 rules reflected a parasitic subculture of deckers who adapted the tools of a legitimate host culture for their own purposes. Matrix 2.0 rules, however, reflect major advances in illegal programming and technology. Today, commercial machines like the Fairlight Excalibur are far behind the SOTA. As a result, most Matrix 2.0 deckers build their own decks or buy custom-made ones. Deckmeisters are the most common source for customized decks, but a few manufacturers also produce them. (See the archetype for the Deckmeister, p. 92, for more information).

OPTIONAL RULE: BANDWIDTH

Bandwidth is the speed at which data moves over a connection. Old modems measured it in "baud," or bits per second. A 2,400 baud modem could send or receive 2,400 bits per second. With modern optical technology, bandwidth is measured in MePS (megapulses per second). Matrix 2.0 rules include two types of bandwidth: icon bandwidth and I/O bandwidth. Icon bandwidth handles commands and sensory data to and from the deck. I/O bandwidth is used for data transfers. Both types of bandwidth affect the size of a decker's datatrail, which influences how easily trace IC programs can locate them. The gamemaster can use one or both forms of bandwidth in their game. The icon bandwidth rule is simple, while the I/O bandwidth rule is more complex. If these optional rules are not used, assume any grid connection operates at near-instantaneous speeds. The I/O speed of cyberdecks determines data-transfer rates, according to the Shadowrun, Second Edition Matrix rules.

ICON BANDWIDTH

Icon bandwidth manages all commands and ASIST signals between the cyberdeck and the Matrix. It is equal to the sum of the decker's persona program ratings and the ratings of all utilities loaded into the deck's active memory. A deck's MPCP, utility options like stealth or optimization, do not affect icon bandwidth. A decker must set their icon bandwidth at the start of a Matrix run, and it remains constant throughout the run. It cannot be changed without disconnecting and starting a new run, with the sole exception being the Suspending Icon Operations rule. If a decker's program ratings are reduced, the icon bandwidth can be reassigned, but it cannot be lowered to make the datatrail harder to trace. Before jacking in, deckers can lower their icon bandwidths by reducing their persona ratings. Any reduced ratings must stay at that level for the entire run. The ratings of utilities cannot be reduced, as they only work at their full rating. The actual memory size of the utilities does not affect icon bandwidth.

For example, Sidewinder has an MPCP-6/5/3/4/4 deck. Since she hasn't reduced her persona ratings, her persona code's bandwidth is 5 + 3 + 4 + 4 = 16 MePS. She also loaded Sleaze-5, Deception-4, Attack-6, and Analyze-4 into her active memory. This adds another 19 MePS, for a total of 35 MePS. If she wanted to load another 5 Mp of utility code, her icon bandwidth would increase to 40.

I/O BANDWIDTH

I/O bandwidth handles uploads and downloads. A deck with an I/O bandwidth of 10 MePS can upload or download 10 Mp of data per second, or 1,000 Mp in 100 seconds. Deckers can change their I/O bandwidths at any time using Retrain operations. They can increase their I/O bandwidth by reassigning MePS from their icon bandwidth, but this requires suspending their icon operations.

Data Transmission

On a 20 MePS Matrix connection, downloading a 1,000 Mp file takes 50 seconds. This is fast for legal users but potentially deadly for a decker trying to evade black IC. The same risk applies when uploading doctored datafiles or booby-trapped programs. To minimize these risks, most deckers keep their bandwidths as small as possible. They perform a Retrain operation at the last moment to grab data, then drop the extra MePS as soon as they are done. High bandwidth when it's not needed can be disastrous if a trace IC program detects the datatrail.

Utility Loads

Swap Memory operations allow deckers to load new copies of utility programs onto their decks. This is useful for changing the mix of utilities or replacing damaged programs. The speed of a Swap Memory operation depends on the deck's I/O bandwidth (see System Operations, p. 117).

Multiplexing

Multiplexing allows a decker to upload multiple utilities or upload and download files simultaneously. To do this, the decker divides their I/O bandwidth MePSs among different tasks as they choose. For example, a decker with 100 MePS of I/O bandwidth could download at 25 MePS and upload at 75 MePS. Multiplexing is a Free Action and requires no tests.

Retraining

Retraining is the process of changing I/O bandwidth during a Matrix run using a Retrain operation (see System Operations, p. 117).

Suspending Icon Operations

Deckers can re-assign their icon bandwidths to I/O bandwidth by suspending their icon. The entire icon bandwidth must be reassigned; it cannot be divided. For example, a decker with an icon bandwidth of 35 MePS can re-assign all 35 MePS to their I/O bandwidth, but not just 15 MePS. Suspending Icon operations are Free Actions. When icon operations are suspended, all persona ratings (MPCP, Bod, Evasion, Masking, and Sensor) drop to 1. The decker only gets 1D6 for Initiative, regardless of any Response Increases on the cyberdeck. They also lose extra initiative dice from reality filters and DNI controls. All utility program ratings are also reduced by half (rounded down). To restore the ratings, the decker must reallocate the bandwidth back to its original purpose, which is another Free Action. However, the ratings don't return to normal until the decker's next available action. This is a very dangerous situation, as a decker attacked by IC after suspending their icon would have to fight with reduced ratings and Initiative until their next action.

THE DECK SHOP

You won't find a deck shop at a shopping mall with a "Highly Illegal Cyberdecks Sold Here" sign. A deck shop might be a backroom operation with a legitimate front, or an enterprise protected by samurai, organized crime muscle, or other deadly forces. This is considered part of the overhead. The inside of a deck shop could be a cluttered mess of components, workstations, and optical crystals, or it could be a meticulously clean facility. Personal style and competence matter more than tidiness in this field. A microtronics facility alone is worth 300,000 nuyen. A deckmeister who has been in business for a while might have millions of nuyen worth of raw chips, logic circuits, and other components like bioscanners and ASIST interfaces. They also have local computing power with a few gigapulses of memory and a workstation or mainframe for top-tier coders. Chips and mini-CDs filled with source code are organized in a way only the deckmeister can understand. This is the kind of place deckers dream of, even if the "elves" are heavily armed and speak in Sperethiel. Hitting a deck shop is a bad idea; it draws the wrath of the owner, their muscle, and every decker who depends on that shop. It's a faster way to die than joining the Universal Brotherhood or sending your resume to Lone Star.

Deckers use many different types of programs. Persona programs define the decker's online icon, utility programs help with system operations or specific actions, and command set programs instruct computers to perform specific jobs. This section defines program types and provides rules for creating them. The programming process applies to any program, from a deadly attack utility to a simple spreadsheet. Note that these rules do not apply to persona and deck programs, which are covered in Cyberdecks, p. 81.

SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE

A source program, or source code, is the original, human-readable form of a program. Common programming languages in the Sixth World include HoloLISP, InterMod, MATCom, and Oblong. These languages combine verbal or written input with dynamic icon manipulation to build programs in virtual reality. Once the source code is written, it can be translated into an object format. Object format is the machine language of the Matrix, consisting of linked holographic constructs that are executable programs. Object code is what is loaded into memory when a utility runs or is cooked into an OCC. To upgrade or modify a program, a decker must have the source code. Object-code copies cannot be used to change a program.

UTILITIES

A powerful decker might be able to command the Matrix with their persona and skill alone, but most need to supplement their skills with utility programs. Utilities come in four types: operational, special, offensive, and defensive. Operational utilities are used for a decker's System Tests. Special utilities perform specific tasks, offensive utilities damage opponents, and defensive utilities prevent or reduce combat damage. The multiplier value listed for each utility is used in software tasks and programming (see Cyberdecks, p. 81, and Program Size, p. 101). Each entry also notes which system operations the utility can be used for (see System Operations, p. 108). Some utility descriptions also list options that can be used with them (see Optional Rule: Utility Options, p. 102). Unless noted otherwise, utilities must be preloaded into both active memory and the decker's online icon to work.

OPERATIONAL UTILITIES

Operational utilities assist deckers in executing system operations, similar to how a smartlink helps a samurai with their gun. These utilities reduce the target numbers of a decker's System Tests by the utility's rating (see System Tests, p. 19 in Matrix 2.0). While a decker can perform operations without them, it is more difficult. All operational utilities can use the DINAB, one-shot, optimization, and squeeze options.

    Analyze

        Multiplier: 3

        System Operations: Analyze IC, Analyze Icon, Analyze Security, Locate IC

        The analyze utility reduces target numbers for System Tests that identify IC, programs, and other host-controlled resources or events.

    Browse

        Multiplier: 1

        System Operations: Locate Access Node, Locate File, Locate Slave

        The browse utility reduces target numbers for Index Tests used to locate specific data or system addresses. Unlike analyze and scanner, which search for Matrix activity, browse works on the contents and real-world functions of data nodes.

    Commlink

        Multiplier: 1

        System Operations: Retrain, Tap Comcall

        The commlink utility reduces target numbers for tests affecting the decker's communications link.

    Crash

        Multiplier: 3

        System Operations: Crash Application, Crash Host

        The crash utility reduces target numbers for attempts to crash an application or host.

    Defuse

        Multiplier: 2

        The defuse utility reduces target numbers for System Tests made to defuse data bombs (see Data Bombs, p. 41).

    Deception

        Multiplier: 2

        System Operations: Graceful Logoff, Logon to (LTG, RTG, or Host)

        The deception utility can be used to reduce the target number of all Access Tests, unless noted otherwise.

    Decrypt

        Multiplier: 1

        System Operations: Decrypt Access, Decrypt File, Decrypt Slave

        The decrypt utility reduces target numbers for System Tests made to defeat scramble IC programs.

    Disinfect

        Multiplier: 2

        System Operations: Disinfect

        The disinfect utility reduces target numbers for System Tests made to destroy worm viruses.

    Evaluate

        Multiplier: 2

        System Operations: Locate Paydata

        The evaluate utility sifts through large data samples to find valuable loot. However, it degrades quickly as market demands change. The gamemaster rolls 1D6 - 2 (rounded up) at the end of each run, and the rating of all evaluate programs degrades by that result. This loss occurs whether the decker is in play or not. Deckers can upgrade with source copies or spend 1 Karma Point to restore 1 Rating Point to the utility. This represents the time spent programming market analysis, news, and rumors into the program.

    Mirrors

        Multiplier: 3

        System Operations: Decoy

        The Mirrors utility reduces the decker's target number for System Tests used in the Decoy operation.

    Read/Write

        Multiplier: 2

        System Operations: Download Data, Edit File, Upload Data

        The read/write utility reduces the decker's target number for the listed operations, as well as any other System Tests needed for accessing, editing, or loading data in the Matrix.

    Relocate

        Multiplier: 2

        The relocate utility reduces target numbers for special tests to defeat trace IC programs that have started their location cycles. (See Trace IC, p. 45, for more).

    Scanner

        Multiplier: 3

        System Operations: Locate Decker, Locate Frame

        The scanner utility reduces target numbers for System Tests performed when searching for deckers, frames, or their effects.

    Spoof

        Multiplier: 3

        System Operations: Command Slave, Edit Slave, Monitor Slave

        The spoof utility reduces target numbers for all System Tests affecting system and subsystem slaves.

    Validate

        Multiplier: 4

        System Operations: Dump Log, Validate Passcode

        The validate utility reduces target numbers for any System Tests made to implement administrative changes or read administrative logs.

SPECIAL UTILITIES

Special utilities perform specific jobs and cannot be programmed on the fly. If a decker does not have the program pre-loaded, they cannot use it.

    Compressor

        Multiplier: 2

        The compressor utility reduces the size of data being uploaded or downloaded by 50 percent. The maximum file size it can handle is Rating x 100 Mp. A 100 Mp file would be compressed to 50 Mp, halving the time it takes to transfer. Decks need enough active memory to hold the decompressed size of a program being uploaded. If there isn't enough memory, the Swap Memory operation cannot be performed. For example, uploading a compressed 100 Mp utility requires 100 Mp of free active memory, even though the compressed file is only 50 Mp. Decompressing a file or program in the Matrix is a Complex Action. Compressed files must be decompressed before they can be read or used.

    Sleaze

        Multiplier: 3

        The sleaze utility combines with a deck's Masking Rating to enhance its Detection Factor to (Masking + Sleaze) + 2, rounded up.

    Track

        Multiplier: 8

        The track utility is described as "trace IC for deckers". It was developed by a Renraku programmer who decompiled Lone Star's beagle utility, and the source code was leaked to the shadows. It is used as a combat program against hostile deckers. After a successful attack, the target must make an Evasion (Track Rating) Test. If they fail to get an equal or greater number of successes, the track utility locks onto their datatrail and begins a location cycle like trace IC. To find out how many turns it will take to locate the decker's jackpoint, divide 10 by the attacker's net successes. The target can try to escape by logging off or jacking out, but the track utility makes logoff harder and may still trace a jacked-out decker. The target can use the relocate utility against the track program, making the test against the attacker's Sensor Rating instead of the system's Control Rating. If the relocate succeeds, the track program fails completely, and the attacker must attack again before using it. The target can also crash the attacker's persona to stop their programs.

OFFENSIVE UTILITIES

Offensive utilities inflict damage on icons, including deckers, IC, running programs, and datafiles. Some, like the attack utility, are brute-force destructive programs, while others are more subtle and limited. A decker can program the attack utility on the fly, but not other offensive utilities, during a run (see Cybercombat, p. 123).

    Attack

        Multiplier: Light: 2, Medium: 3, Serious: 4, Deadly: 5

        Target: Deckers, frames, IC, SKs

        Options: Area, chaser, DINAB, limit, one-shot, optimization, penetration, stealth, targeting

        The attack utility is a direct attack on a target's Condition Monitor. It affects online icons only and does not damage a decker's physical body or cyberdeck.

    Black Hammer

        Multiplier: 20

        Target: Deckers

        Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting

        This is a black IC program that targets the decker, not the deck. It can kill a decker while leaving their deck online and traceable. Its effects are identical to lethal black IC, though it lacks the blaster-like capabilities of mainframe-driven black IC (see Black IC, p. 47). The maximum rating is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up. It can be installed in an SK, but not a frame.

    Hog

        Multiplier: 3

        Target: Deckers

        Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        Hog is a virus that introduces self-replicating code into the target deck's active memory, crashing running utilities. If an attacker hits a target with a hog program and wins the subsequent MPCP (Hog Rating) Test (Hardening reduces the target number), the hog reduces the highest-rated program on the deck by one point for every two net successes. The virus continues to drain rating points at the end of every subsequent Combat Turn until the program crashes, then moves to the next highest-rated program. A decker can purge the virus by spending a Complex Action and making a successful Computer (Hog Rating - Hardening) Test against a target number increased by the original program's rating. A single success on this test wipes both the virus and the infected program from active memory, and a hog virus cannot be purged without also purging the infected program.

    Killjoy

        Multiplier: 10

        Target: Deckers

        Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting

        The killjoy utility mimics non-lethal black IC, inflicting Stun damage on a decker's physical body. Otherwise, it is identical to the black hammer utility. The maximum rating is half the programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up.

    Poison

        Multiplier: 3

        Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs

        Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        The poison utility attacks a target's Bod Rating like acid IC. If a decker succeeds in an attack, the target makes a Bod (Poison Rating) Test. The target's Bod Rating is reduced by one point for every two net successes the attacker achieves.

    Restrict

        Multiplier: 3

        Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs

        Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        The restrict utility attacks a target's Evasion Rating. The target makes an Evasion (Restrict Rating) Test, and their Evasion Rating is reduced by one for every two net successes the attacker gets.

    Reveal

        Multiplier: 3

        Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs

        Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        The reveal program attacks a target's Masking Rating. The target makes a Masking (Reveal Rating) Test, and their Masking Rating is reduced by one for every two net successes the attacker achieves.

    Slow

        Multiplier: 4

        Target: IC

        Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        The slow utility reduces the execution speed of proactive IC. If a decker hits IC with this utility, an opposed Resistance (Slow Rating) Test is made for the IC. If the IC gets more successes, nothing happens. If the decker gets more, the IC loses one action for every two net successes and hangs if it has no actions left. Disabling IC this way prevents it from raising the decker's security tally. However, suppressing the IC requires one point of Masking (see Suppressing IC, p. 40), and if the suppression is not maintained, the IC resumes its actions at the start of the next Combat Turn. Reactive IC is not vulnerable to this utility, and trace IC is only vulnerable during its hunting cycle.

    Steamroller

        Multiplier: 3

        Target: Tar Baby, Tar Pits

        Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting

        Steamroller is a specific attack program that inflicts (Rating)D damage to tar IC programs and is immune to their destructive effects. Crashing tar IC with this utility increases the decker's security tally unless the program has the stealth option or the decker suppresses the IC.

DEFENSIVE UTILITIES

Defensive utilities are used to prevent, reduce, or repair damage in cybercombat. They cannot be programmed on the fly. The utility's rating is added or subtracted as noted in the descriptions.

    Armor

        Multiplier: 3

        Options: Optimization

        The armor utility reduces the Power of damage inflicted on a decker's icon by its Armor Rating. It is effective against standard damage to the icon's Condition Monitor from things like killer IC and the attack utility, but has no effect on collateral damage to the decker's body or deck, which is protected by Hardening. The utility loses one Rating Point every time it fails to fully absorb damage from a hit. Degrading armor utilities can be replaced with fresh copies using a Swap Memory operation.

    Camo

        Multiplier: 3

        Options: One-shot, optimization

        The camo utility's rating is added to the trace factor, which makes it harder for trace IC to follow a deck's datatrail (see Trace IC, p. 45). It also acts as an operational utility for the Redirect Datatrail operation (see System Operations, p. 117).

    Cloak

        Multiplier: 3

        Options: One-shot, optimization

        The cloak utility reduces the target numbers for Evasion Tests during combat maneuvers (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121).

    Lock-On

        Multiplier: 3

        Options: One-shot, optimization

        The lock-on utility reduces the target numbers for opposed Sensor Tests during combat maneuvers (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121).

    Medic

        Multiplier: 4

        Options: DINAB, optimization

        The medic utility reduces the number of filled boxes on an icon's Condition Monitor. To use it, a decker spends a Complex Action and makes a Success Test with a number of dice equal to the utility's rating. The target number depends on the damage level, as shown on the Medic Target Numbers Table. Each success repairs one wound box on the monitor. The program loses one Rating Point each time it's used, regardless of success. Deckers can load a new copy with a Swap Memory operation to restore its full rating.

    MEDIC TARGET NUMBERS TABLE

        Wound Level

            Light: Target Number 4

            Moderate: Target Number 5

            Serious: Target Number 6

    Restore

        Multiplier: 3

        Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization

        The restore utility repairs damage to online icon attributes, but cannot fix permanent damage to persona chips from gray or black IC. To use it, the decker makes a Restore Test against a target number equal to the rating of the program that caused the damage (using the higher rating if multiple programs caused damage). The utility repairs one point of damage for every two successes on the test.

    Shield

        Multiplier: 4

        Options: Optimization

        Shield allows a decker to parry attacks in cybercombat. When an attack affects the persona, the decker can make a Shield Test against a target number equal to the attacker's skill (e.g., Computer Skill for a decker, Security Value for IC). The attacker's net successes are reduced by the number of successes on the Shield Test. This utility is also effective against crippler and ripper IC attacks and any other attack where the decker makes an opposed test. The utility loses one Rating Point every time it's used, regardless of success. Fresh copies can be loaded via a Swap Memory operation.

PROGRAMMING

All programming jobs are considered tasks with specific base times, periods, and tests. The base time to write a program is the program's size multiplied by two, resulting in a number of days. This calculation includes any size increases from program options. To find the task period, make a Computer (Program Rating) Test (or substitute the Software concentration or Matrix Programming specialization). Divide the base time by the number of successes on the test to get the task period in days. The Program Rating used in the test is the program's actual rating, not including changes from options.

PROGRAM RATINGS

A deck's MPCP and frame core ratings cannot exceed the programmer's skill rating multiplied by 1.5. The programmer can use Computer Skill, its Software concentration, or Matrix Programming specialization. All other program ratings cannot exceed the skill rating itself.

PROGRAM SIZE

A program's size is determined by squaring its rating and multiplying the result by its multiplier. The Program Size Table provides precalculated sizes in megapulses (Mp) for ratings 1-14 and multipliers up to 10. The table should cover most cases, but for unusual programs, gamemasters must perform their own calculations. If modifiers reduce a program's effective rating below 1, use a rating of 1 to determine design time and memory. To use the table, find the program's rating on the left and read across to the correct multiplier column. For example, a Rating 4 program with a multiplier of 6 has a size of 96 Mp.

PROGRAMMING TOOLS

The minimum setup for programming is a personal computer with memory equal to or greater than the program size. Personal computers cost 20¥ per Mp of memory, while miniature decks cost more (see p. 259, SRII). If the computer has double the required memory, it provides a +1 task bonus (see Deckers and Tasks, p. 77). A basic programming tool suite, or "kit," can be installed for 1,500¥, giving a -1 task bonus. A more advanced "shop" costs 15,000¥, provides a +2 task bonus, and doubles the computer's memory. If a decker already doubled the memory, a programming shop effectively quadruples it and gives a +3 bonus (+1 for memory, +2 for the shop).

Using a mainframe host instead of a PC gives a +4 bonus. The mainframe's Security Value must be at least half the program's rating. The cost for one day of programming time on a mainframe is the Security Value multiplied by 100¥. Companies that sell machine time set up virtual machines with the required ratings and have strong security. They will revoke access if a customer messes with the system's security. Buying a mainframe is expensive, costing the Security Value multiplied by 5,000,000¥. A programming suite for a mainframe adds a +1 bonus to the host bonus. This suite is expensive, costing 300,000¥, and one day of programming time costs the mainframe's Security Value multiplied by 200¥. Standard kits and shops only work on personal computers, and mainframe suites only work on mainframes.

Deckers can also "steal" programming time on a host. This requires a successful Validate Passcode operation to plant a counterfeit passcode, which allows them to use the host until administrators notice and delete it. System operators may also send their own deckers or IC after the offending programmer.

Selena has a Computer Skill of 8 and wants to write an Attack-8S program. The program's rating is 8, and the Attack-S multiplier is 4, so the size is 8^2 x 4 = 256 Mp. The base time for the programming task is 256 x 2 = 512 days. She makes a Computer Test against a target number of 8 and gets 4 successes (2 from the test, 2 from Karma). Dividing the base time of 512 by 4 gives her a task period of 128 days. She buys a personal computer with 256 Mp of memory for 5,120¥ and works for 10 days, reducing the task period to 118 days. After a run, she upgrades her PC to 512 Mp for another 5,120¥, which is twice the needed memory, giving her a +1 bonus. Her next 10 days of work count as 20, reducing the period to 98 days. She then buys a programming kit for 1,500¥, which adds another +1 bonus for a total of +2. Her next 5 days of work count as 15, reducing the period to 83 days. Finally, she gets 15 days of mainframe time with a +4 bonus, making those 15 days count as 75. With only 8 days left, she returns to her PC with its +2 bonus and finishes the task in 3 days.

Programming Teams

Characters can work together to produce programs. The maximum team size is half the Computer Skill rating (rounded down) of the member with the highest skill. The maximum program rating a team can produce is one plus the highest Computer Skill rating. For example, a player with Computer Skill 8 can form a team of up to 4, and the team can create programs with a rating of 9.

To determine the task period, average the skills of all team members (rounded up) for the Computer Skill Test. The team cannot share tools or task bonuses; each member must have the minimum required resources. Without bonuses, each day of work reduces the task period by one day. To apply bonuses, add all individual bonuses together and subtract the number of programmers on the team. The result is the team's combined bonus. For example, a team of three with bonuses of +3, +2, and +3 would have a total bonus of +5, so each day they work reduces the task period by six days.

OPTIONAL RULE: UTILITY OPTIONS

Utility options are modifications that change how a utility works. An option generally improves a program in one way while limiting it in another. Options can make the Matrix rules much more complex, so gamemasters and players should be familiar with the standard rules before introducing them. Gamemasters can also modify the rules or introduce only specific options. It is important to keep utility and IC options balanced, as many utility options are designed to counter specific IC options (see Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 50).

OPTIONS AND SIZE

With standard rules, a program's size is fixed. This size determines the base time to write the program and how much space it takes on a deck. With utility options, programs have two sizes: an actual size (space on the deck) and a design size (used for programming base time). Options can change a program's size by altering its rating or by increasing its size by a percentage. In some cases, an option might reduce the actual size but increase the design size due to the need for highly efficient code. When combining multiple options, apply any rating changes first, then calculate percentage changes sequentially. For example, a 180 Mp program with two 50% size reductions would first become 90 Mp, then 45 Mp.

OPTIONS AND RATINGS

Changes to a program's effective rating from options do not count against the maximum rating a programmer can design. For example, a programmer with Computer Skill 8 can design a utility with a base rating of 8, even if options increase its effective rating for programming. Changes from options also do not affect the target number for the programming task. A Slow-4 utility with an Area-4 option would still have a target number of 4, not 8. The maximum rating for an option is the same as the program's base rating. A Slow-4 program can't have an Area-4 option, even if the programmer's skill is higher.

OPTIONS AND COST

A program's price is based on its base rating and design size. Option ratings do not affect the price. For example, an Attack-6M program without options has a base rating of 6 and a design size of 108 Mp, for a street price of 108 x 200 = 21,600 nuyen. An Attack-6M(Skulk-4) program has an effective rating of 10 and a design size of 300 Mp, for a price of 60,000 nuyen.

AREA

    Rating Modifier: +Area Rating

    The area option allows a utility to attack multiple targets at once on a host, up to the option's rating. The decker makes one Attack Test, and the result is applied to all targets. The target number for each target is increased by the total number of targets. For example, if two corp deckers (A and B) are engaged by an intruder on a Green host (base target number of 4), decker A might have a target number of 6 due to a previous maneuver. The intruder uses an attack program with the area option; the target number is 8 for decker A (6 + 2 targets) and 6 for decker B (4 + 2 targets). If the intruder's test yields a 7, 8, and 7, they get one success against A and three against B. The armor defensive utility adds a +2 modifier to its effective Armor Rating when a persona or IC program is attacked with a utility that has the area option.

CHASER

    Rating Modifier: +1

    The chaser option cancels out the +2 target-number penalty for attacks against IC with the shift defensive utility. However, it adds a +2 target-number penalty to attacks against IC with the shield defensive utility. The chaser and penetration options cannot be on the same utility.

DINAB

    Rating Modifier: +DINAB Rating

    DINAB ("decker in a box") gives a utility program a built-in Computer Skill equal to the DINAB rating. A decker can use a Free Action on any of their actions to have the utility run itself. For example, a decker with analyze, mirrors, and browse all equipped with DINAB could use a Free Action and two Simple Actions to run all three utilities, even if each normally requires a Complex Action. A utility cannot run two operations in the same action, and the decker cannot use the program themselves while it is running under DINAB. The DINAB option loses one Rating Point every time it fails a test because opponents can analyze and exploit its weaknesses. A test is considered a failure any time DINAB is defeated in a System Test opposed by the host/system. It also degrades if it fails to hit a target in cybercombat or if the target completely negates the damage. If a program or frame under DINAB control fails a test with all 1s, it crashes and must be reloaded. A Swap Memory operation restores degraded DINAB options and crashed programs. Frames can be equipped with DINAB, and smart frames must have it. A decker can override DINAB control and use their own Computer Skill, but they must then use the action type normally required for the program.

LIMIT

    Rating Modifier: -1

    The limit option restricts a utility to a single type of target, such as deckers, IC, frames, or SKs. The program is useless against other targets. This option reduces the program's effective rating and actual size. For example, an Attack-6M (Limit: IC) program would have a rating of 5, so its size would be 5^2 x 3, instead of 6^2 x 3.

ONE-SHOT

    Rating Modifier: Special

    The one-shot option makes a utility single-use, causing it to disappear after one execution. To use it again, the decker must reload it with a Swap Memory operation. This option reduces the utility's actual size by 75% but increases its design size by 50%. A decker can have multiple copies of one-shot programs in active memory, but tar baby and tar pit IC are very effective against this. If a tar program trashes a one-shot utility, it wipes out all copies of it in active memory.

OPTIMIZATION

    Rating Modifier: Special

    The optimization option reduces a program's actual size by 50% and increases its design size by 100%.

PENETRATION

    Rating Modifier: +1

    The penetration option defeats the shield defensive utility. However, it adds a +2 target-number penalty to attacks against IC with the shift defensive utility, in addition to the -2 penalty from shield. The penetration and chaser options cannot be on the same utility.

SENSITIVE

    Rating Modifier: Special

    The sensitive option makes a program work on only one manufacturer's mainframes. A utility with the Mitsuhama sensitive option would work on MCT computers but be useless on others. Creating these programs requires in-depth knowledge of different system architectures. For the Computer Test in the programming task, use an average of the programmer's Computer Skill and Computer Theory or its Matrix Theory concentration. This option reduces a utility's actual size by 75% and increases its design size by 50%.

SKULK

    Rating Modifier: +Stealth Rating

    The skulk option allows a decker to reduce or eliminate increases to their security tally when crashing IC programs (see Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 40). When a decker crashes an IC with a skulk-equipped program, the security tally increase is reduced by the Skulk Rating.

SQUEEZE

    Rating Modifier: -1

    The squeeze option creates a self-compressed program. It reduces the utility's actual size by 50% for uploading, as if it were compressed with the Compression utility. A squeezed program cannot be used until the decker spends a Complex Action to decompress it, which requires no test. If a squeezed program is uploaded using the compression option, its size is reduced by 75%. However, it must be decompressed twice: one Complex Action for each option. The squeeze rating modifier only affects design size, not actual size. A deck must have enough free active memory to accommodate the decompressed utility.

TARGETING

    Rating Modifier: +2

    The targeting option provides a -2 target-number modifier for attacks made with combat utilities that have this option.

COMMAND SETS

A command set is a simple program of orders that a decker can leave on a host to be executed later. Writing one may require one or more Subsystem Tests, depending on the task. For example, manipulating a remote device requires a Slave Test. Printing or erasing a file requires a Files Test. Opening a SAN at a specific time requires an Access Test. The gamemaster determines the specific Subsystem Test needed (use a Control Test if unsure). The deception utility reduces the target numbers for all these tests (see Deception, p. 96).

More complex actions require the decker to write and upload a program in advance. The design size for such programs is 1D6 x 20 Mp. After uploading, the decker must make a successful Control Test to load it onto the host. To determine how long the program runs before being detected, add up all the successes the host scored in opposing the Subsystem Tests, and divide 24 by that number. If the host scores no successes, the command set remains undetected for 48 hours.

FRAMES

Frames are combinations of utilities chosen by a decker, similar to how constructs are combinations of IC programs. They can be either dumb or smart. Dumb frames are linked to the decker's persona and only exist as long as the decker is active on the host. Smart frames can exist independently in the Matrix.

FRAME CORE

The frame core is the master control program for a frame. Its size is determined by the formula: Frame Core Rating^2 x Frame Core Multiplier. The multiplier is 2 for dumb frames and 3 for smart cores. The programmer must specify if the core will be dumb or smart when writing it. Frame cores can be equipped with the DINAB, optimization, and squeeze options. The core's rating cannot exceed the programmer's Computer Skill x 1.5 (rounded down). The following characteristics are derived from the Core Rating: the combined ratings of the core's Bod, Evasion, Masking, and Sensor attributes cannot exceed the Core Rating. Any of these attributes can be set to 0 if the decker chooses. The Core Rating is used in place of an MPCP Rating for any test that requires one. The Reaction attribute of a smart frame is equal to its Core Rating. The combined ratings of all programs in the frame (not including options) cannot exceed the Core Rating. If points from the Core Rating are allocated to the frame's Initiative, the reduced Core Rating is used for this purpose (see Smart Frame Initiative, below). Deckers can reuse frame cores with different sets of utilities to make new frames, but the core's attributes cannot be rearranged.

DINAB and Cores

All smart frame cores must be programmed with the DINAB option, which acts as the core's Computer Skill. The addition of the DINAB option increases the core's design rating by the DINAB Rating. Dumb frames only execute programs on a decker's command. However, dumb cores can be fitted with the DINAB option to trigger one of the frame's programs on a given action. For both dumb and smart cores, the DINAB option rating cannot exceed the programmer's Computer Skill and is set during programming and cannot be changed later.

Smart Frame Initiative

Smart frames have their own Reaction and Initiative Ratings, separate from the decker's. An unmodified smart frame rolls 1D6 for Initiative. A programmer can increase this by allocating part of the Core Rating: one point provides 1 additional Initiative die, up to a maximum of 4D6 for 5 points. If the frame's Core Rating is reduced, the program ratings must also be reduced so their total doesn't exceed the new rating. Core Rating points allocated to Initiative are set at the time of programming and cannot be changed later.

FRAME LOADING

After creating a frame core, a programmer can load it with object code copies of any available programs. These programs can be standard or have options. The combined ratings of these programs (not including option ratings) cannot exceed the frame's Core Rating. If Core Rating points were allocated to Initiative, the reduced rating is used for this purpose. Programmers cannot load a partial utility into a frame; a partial copy will not work.

Loading programs is a task similar to programming. First, calculate the Loading Rating by combining the program ratings and dividing by 2. This rating is only used to determine the task period. Next, calculate the loading size with the formula: Loading Rating^2 = loading size in Mp. Then, find the loading base time: loading size x 2 = loading base time in days. Finally, make a Computer Test against the average program rating to find the task period: loading base time ÷ Computer Test successes = task period in days. The actual size of a frame is the sum of the actual size of the core and all the programs and options loaded on it.

For example, Genie has a 12-point smart frame core with a DINAB-8 option. She allocates 2 points to the frame's Initiative, leaving 10 points for programs. She wants to load Attack-6S and Cloak-4 programs. The loading rating is (6+4) ÷ 2 = 5. Loading size is 5^2 = 25 Mp. Loading base time is 25 x 2 = 50 days. She gets 5 successes on her Computer Test, making the task period 10 days (50 ÷ 5). The final frame is 1,392 Mp in size: 1,200 Mp for the core, 144 Mp for the Attack-6S, and 48 Mp for the Cloak-4.

RUNNING A FRAME

To run a frame, a decker must first log on to a host and upload it. The frame starts running as soon as the upload is complete. Compressed or squeezed frames must be decompressed first.

DUMB FRAMES

Giving a command to a dumb frame is a Simple Action, even if the program requires a Complex Action. For example, a decker could use an analyze program in a frame to perform an Analyze Security operation as a Simple Action. The frame carries out the order, but it cannot repeat an action; a second attack requires a second command. If a decker logs off a host, any dumb frames they are running crash and do not follow them to other systems.

Dumb frames can be used for several purposes, including as a decoy, an event trigger, or a weapon carrier.

    Decoy frames can act as scout drones and decoys, performing Analyze operations or being fitted with scanner utilities for Locate Decker operations (see System Operations, p. 114). When a decker performs a Decoy operation, the system's security measures target the decoy frame as long as the decker remains inactive. The decker uses their own Computer Skill for tests, but all attribute-related scores are based on the frame's ratings, and only the utilities loaded in the frame can be used. If the frame's actions trigger IC programs, they will target the frame, not the decker's persona. However, since the frame and decker share the same datatrail, this does not help against trace IC. Once a decoy frame crashes, the host and any active IC react to the decker's actions normally.

    Event Triggers: Deckers can create dumb frames to notify them of specific events on a host, but the decker must be on the same system to receive the message. This might require a Null operation (see System Operations, p. 117). An event trigger frame needs a Sensor attribute and analyze and/or scan utilities with ratings at least half the host's Security Value. An analyze utility is needed to detect events from the host or its programs. A scanner utility is needed to detect events from other deckers or legal users. Other utilities can be included if there's enough capacity.

    Weapon Carriers: Deckers often load dumb frames with offensive utilities to use as auxiliary weapons in cybercombat. These frames allow a decker to use weapons that don't take up their own active memory or icon bandwidth. The drawback is that if the frame crashes, the decker loses the programs. Each attack with a weapon-carrier frame is a Simple Action.

SMART FRAMES

Smart frames can do everything a dumb frame can do. They also have their own "skill" (DINAB Rating) and their own Reaction and Initiative ratings. A decker can use a Free Action to give a smart frame a basic order, and the frame will carry it out on its own. For example, a decker can order a smart frame with combat utilities to find and destroy an icon. The frame has its own actions and does not require the decker's attention or use up their actions.

UPGRADING

Deckers can upgrade any program in this section (except for command sets) by increasing its rating, but they must have a copy of the program's source code. Upgrading is a programming task. To determine the base time for an upgrade, first find the base time for creating the program from scratch, then subtract the base time for the current version. The result is the new base time for the upgrade task. Next, determine the task period by making a Computer Test against the new program rating and dividing the upgrade task base time by the number of successes. The rest of the process follows standard programming rules (see Programming, p. 100). Deckers can also upgrade a program by adding options instead of increasing its rating.

BUYING PROGRAMS

Deckers can buy any of the programs described in this section. A program's price is determined by its rating and design size, and option ratings do not affect these prices. Availability Tests are made using the Etiquette (Matrix) Skill. All prices include the cost of both object code and a copy of the source code. The price is reduced by 25% for object-code-only programs. Under Virtual Realities 2.0 rules, all program prices, including persona and utilities, are calculated using the formulas on the Program Prices Table. The price of firmware is unbundled from the software price in these rules, unlike in the original SR Matrix rules.

A system operation is a command or series of commands a decker gives a host or grid to perform a specific task. Nearly every task a decker performs in cyberspace is a system operation, and gamemasters can create new ones using these as guidelines. A system operation is a rules procedure, not a skill, for determining if a decker succeeds in their intended action. Every operation has three parts: a System Test, an appropriate utility, and a type of game action. The System Test specifies which Subsystem Test (Access, Control, Index, Files, or Slave) the decker makes against the host/grid's appropriate subsystem rating. As part of the test, the gamemaster makes an opposed Security Test for the host/grid against the decker's Detection Factor (see System Tests, p. 19 in Matrix 2.0). The action listed for each operation is the type of game action (Free, Simple, or Complex) the decker must spend to perform it. Simple operations, like getting a single piece of information, are generally Free Actions. Operations involving a single program, icon, or control are usually Simple Actions. Any action involving a search, analysis, or control of a complex system is a Complex Action. Most operations fall into three categories: interrogations, ongoing operations, and monitored operations.

INTERROGATIONS

In most operations, a host immediately carries out a decker's order. During an interrogation, a decker engages in a dialogue with the system to search for specific information. If a decker achieves five or more successes, they get the information they are looking for. The gamemaster can also specify the number of successes needed to reveal a list of data. The more precise the query, the better the chances of success, while vague or poorly phrased inquiries get a target number modifier penalty. If the host doesn't have the information, the gamemaster reveals this after the decker achieves four or more successes.

ONGOING OPERATIONS

Some operations are finished after a successful System Test, but others, like uploads and downloads, take time. In ongoing operations, the decker starts the process and then lets it run without further commands. The time required is specified in seconds. To convert seconds to Combat Turns, divide by 3 and do not round fractions. For example, a 6-second upload takes 2 Combat Rounds, so if it starts at Combat Turn 3, the utility can be used at the start of Turn 5. A 7-second upload, which is 2 Combat Rounds with a 1-second remainder, means the utility can be used during the second action of Turn 5. A 5-second upload (1 round with a 2-second remainder) can be used during the third action of Turn 5.

MONITORED OPERATIONS

Monitored operations must be actively controlled after they begin. After the initial System Test, the decker must use a Free Action on every available action to maintain the operation. If they fail to do so even once, the operation aborts, and they must repeat the System Test to restart it. Aborting a monitored operation can sometimes have irreversible real-world consequences, such as a security camera showing a decker's companions breaking in after an Edit Slave operation fails.

OPERATIONS DESCRIPTIONS

    ANALYZE HOST

        Test: Control

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Complex

        This operation lets a decker analyze a host's ratings. For each success on the Control Test, the gamemaster provides one of the following: the host's Security Rating, the rating of any of its five subsystems, or whether it's a VM. Seven or more successes give the decker all available information. A decker must be on the host to perform this operation; there are no sneak previews from the grid.

    ANALYZE IC

        Test: Control

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Free

        This operation identifies a specific IC program that the decker has located. A successful operation reveals the IC's type, rating, options, and defenses. For trace IC, it also reveals if it is in its hunting or location cycle and how many turns remain if it's in a location cycle.

    ANALYZE ICON

        Test: Control

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Free

        This operation scans an icon to identify its general type (e.g., IC, persona, frame). The decker can reduce the Control Test target number by their Sensor Rating and the rating of any analyze utility they are running. However, the target number cannot drop below 2.

    ANALYZE SECURITY

        Test: Control

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Simple

        This operation tells the decker the host's current Security Rating, their security tally, and the host's alert status.

    ANALYZE SUBSYSTEM

        Test: Targeted Subsystem

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Simple

        This operation identifies anything unusual about a targeted subsystem, such as trap doors, worms, or scramble IC.

    CONTROL SLAVE

        Test: Slave

        Utility: Spoof

        Action: Complex

        This operation allows a decker to take control of a remote device managed by the host's Slave subsystem. This can include anything from security doors to automated factories. If controlling a manufacturing or scientific process, the decker must make the Slave Test using the average of their Computer Skill and a relevant skill like Biotech or Medicine. This is a monitored operation.

    CRASH APPLICATION

        Test: Appropriate Subsystem

        Utility: Crash

        Action: Simple

        This operation shuts down one of the host's application programs, which are legitimate programs other than IC or decking programs. The subsystem test depends on the application; for example, a factory control program would require a Slave Test. Shutting down a user's session is a function of the Files subsystem. If unsure, the gamemaster can call for a Control Test. This operation has no effect on IC, frames, or other deckers.

    CRASH HOST

        Test: Control

        Utility: Crash

        Action: Complex

        This is the decker's "doomsday weapon". A successful operation forces the host to shut down, dumping all users, including the decker (unless they perform a Graceful Logoff first). If the operation succeeds, divide 10 Combat Turns by the number of successes to find the countdown until shutdown. At the end of each Combat Turn, the host makes a Security Value Test against the decker's MPCP Rating to try and abort the process. During the countdown, all IC programs on the host have their ratings reduced by 2. These ratings return to normal if the crash is averted. A decker cannot stop a shutdown they initiated. A shutdown wipes out all frames, command sets, and other programs left by the decker. The host reboots, automatically cleaning its code, deleting security tallies, and restarting with its base ratings. System administrators typically increase security measures after a decker-instigated crash.

    DECOY

        Test: Control

        Utility: Mirrors

        Action: Complex

        This operation creates a decoy copy of the decker's icon to draw the attention of proactive IC. The decker records their successes on the Control Test. When a proactive IC program attacks, roll 1D6. If the roll is less than the decker's successes, the IC attacks the decoy instead. Ties go to the decoy. Decoys have no special defenses or damage resistance and disappear when their Condition Monitors fill up. They are not effective against trace IC. Decoy operations can also be used to lock the attention of IC onto frames.

    DECRYPT ACCESS

        Test: Access

        Utility: Decrypt

        Action: Simple

        This operation defeats scramble IC programs guarding access to a host. It must be performed before a decker can do a Log-On to Host operation on a scrambled SAN.

    DECRYPT FILE

        Test: Files

        Utility: Decrypt

        Action: Simple

        This operation defeats scramble IC programs on a file. It must be performed on scrambled files before performing other operations on them.

    DECRYPT SLAVE

        Test: Slave

        Utility: Decrypt

        Action: Simple

        This operation defeats scramble IC programs on a Slave subsystem. A decker cannot make Slave Tests against a scrambled subsystem until they have performed a successful Decrypt Slave operation on it.

    DISINFECT

        Test: Appropriate Subsystem

        Utility: Disinfect

        Action: Complex

        This operation destroys worm virus programs on a specific subsystem. The decker makes the test against the targeted subsystem (e.g., a Files Test for worms on the Files subsystem).

    DOWNLOAD DATA

        Test: Files

        Utility: Read/Write

        Action: Simple

        This operation copies a file from a host to the decker's cyberdeck. Data moves at the decker's allocated I/O bandwidth and can be transferred to active memory, storage memory, or off-line storage. This is an ongoing operation that continues until the transfer is complete, the decker logs off, is crashed, or terminates it early. If terminated early, the resulting corrupted file is worthless. If the file is important to an adventure, the gamemaster may allow partially completed downloads to produce damaged but readable files. The base time to reconstruct a damaged file is calculated as (full file size in Mp / downloaded data in Mp) x 2 days. To determine if the reconstructed file contains the pertinent information, the gamemaster divides the size of the downloaded file by the full size of the original file. For example, a 10 Mp copy of a 100 Mp file would have a base reconstruction time of 20 days and a 10% chance of containing the information.

    DUMP LOG

        Test: Control

        Utility: Validate

        Action: Complex

        This is an interrogation operation that lets a decker read host-access logs. These logs record legal users, files accessed, programs run, and any observed intrusions. Intrusions might also appear as fatal program aborts or hardware glitches. If the log is crucial, the gamemaster should prepare it in advance, otherwise they can improvise. Deckers can also download logs for later analysis. The size of a 24-hour log is the host's log size multiplier multiplied by 100 Mp.

    EDIT FILE

        Test: Files

        Utility: Read/Write

        Action: Simple

        This operation allows a decker to create, change, or erase a datafile. Small changes can be made directly on the host, while larger amounts of data must be prepared off-line and then uploaded. Any uploaded information can be inserted with a single operation. A successful Files Test can create new files, but they may be erased by the operating system since they lack legal headers. Deckers can also use this operation to copy files to a less secure part of the same host for later retrieval. This requires two Subsystem Tests: a Files Test and a test against the subsystem where the file is being hidden. After making changes, a decker must make a Computer Test against a target number of the host's Files Rating x 2 to see if the host notices. The decker can add their deck's Masking Rating to their Computer Skill for this test. The same test can be used to check if a file has been tampered with, in which case the decker can add their Sensor Rating to their Computer Skill. The gamemaster must decide if back-up copies of a deleted file exist.

    EDIT SLAVE

        Test: Slave

        Utility: Spoof

        Action: Complex

        This is a monitored operation that lets a decker modify data sent to or from a remote device controlled by the host's Slave subsystem. A decker could use this to alter video feeds from a security camera or change sensor readings being sent to a console.

    GRACEFUL LOGOFF

        Test: Access

        Utility: Deception

        Action: Complex

        This operation allows a decker to disconnect from a host and LTG without suffering dump shock. A successful operation also clears all traces of the decker and their actions from the host's security and memory, and makes them invulnerable to trace IC after disconnecting (see Trace IC, p. 45).

    INVALIDATE PASSCODE

        Test: Control

        Utility: Validate

        Action: Complex

        This operation allows a decker to erase a single passcode from a host's security tables. It can also be used to trash the entire passcode list, forcing legitimate users to log on illegally and putting them on equal footing with the intruding decker. When attempting to wipe the entire list, add a +4 modifier to the target number for the decker's Control Test.

    LOCATE ACCESS NODE

        Test: Index

        Utility: Browse

        Action: Complex

        This operation is "directory assistance" for the Sixth World. It finds the codes for LTGs that provide access to hosts, and can also locate commcodes for trid calls. The target number for the Index Test is modified based on the decker's goal. For example, a vague search for a company system adds a +1 modifier, a more specific search has no modifier, and a definite, specific goal gives a -1 modifier. Once an LTG code is found, the decker doesn't need to repeat the operation unless the address changes. This is an interrogation operation.

    LOCATE DECKER

        Test: Index

        Utility: Scanner

        Action: Complex

        This is a two-step process. The decker makes a System Test and a Sensor Test to find other deckers whose Masking attributes are equal to or lower than their Sensor Test result. They also learn if the found deckers log off or jack out. If a target is running a sleaze utility, its rating is added to their Masking Rating to determine if they are located. Located deckers can break contact by maneuvering (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121). Friendly deckers can make their presence known to each other automatically.

    LOCATE FRAME

        Test: Index

        Utility: Scanner

        Action: Complex

        This operation locates any smart frames or SKs on the host. It doesn't work against IC constructs, which are protected by the host, but they can be located with the Locate IC operation (see Locate IC, below).

    LOCATE FILE

        Test: Index

        Utility: Browse

        Action: Complex

        This is an interrogation operation for finding specific datafiles. The decker must have some idea of what they are looking for, not just "valuable data" (see Locate Paydata). If the operation succeeds, the decker learns the file's system location. Distributed databases can lead a decker on a scavenger hunt through the Matrix. A decker on Host B might find a file that points to Host C, which in turn points to another host, until they reach the master database. The gamemaster can roll 1D6 to determine how many links exist.

    LOCATE IC

        Test: Index

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Complex

        This operation follows the same rules as Locate Decker. However, a decker automatically locates the IC programs if their System Test succeeds, without a Sensor Test. The IC remains located unless it maneuvers to evade detection.

    LOCATE PAYDATA

        Test: Index

        Utility: Evaluate

        Action: Complex

        This is an interrogation operation for searching a host for marketable data. For each net success on the Index Test, the operation finds one point of paydata. The operation continues until the decker stops or finds all the paydata. Once located, paydata must be downloaded completely; if a file is 20 Mp, all 20 Mp must be downloaded or it's useless. Paydata is fenced according to standard SR rules (see p. 188, SRII).

    LOCATE SLAVE

        Test: Index

        Utility: Analyze

        Action: Complex

        This operation follows the same rules as Locate File. It finds system addresses for remote devices controlled by the host. A vague inquiry would be "Find all the security cameras," while a specific one would be "Find the camera that monitors the eastern stairwell door". Since hosts have fewer slaves than files, a decker only needs three successes on their Index Test to locate the desired system. After finding the node, they can perform operations like Command Slave and Read or Write Slave.

    LOGON TO HOST

        Test: Access

        Utility: Deception

        Action: Complex

        This operation is an opposed Access Test against the host's Access Rating. Any appropriate modifiers are applied, and the decker's security tally begins with any successes from the host's Security Test. The decker won't know the host's Access Rating until their first attempt. A successful test makes the host's virtual landscape visible. The icon's entry point depends on how they accessed the host: an I/O port for a workstation, a slave controller for a remote device, or the CPU node for a console (see p. 166, SRII). These locations don't affect tests but are for descriptive purposes. Once on the host, the decker can perform other operations like analyzing defenses or looking for paydata.

    LOGON TO LTG

        Test: Access

        Utility: Deception

        Action: Complex

        This is an opposed Access Test against the LTG's Access Rating. Modifiers for the jackpoint and bandwidth are applied (see Jackpoints, p. 28, and Bandwidth, p. 90), and the decker's security tally on the grid starts with any successes from the grid's Security Test. If the decker fails, their attempt fails, but they can try again. However, their security tally remains for some time (public LTGs "remember" unauthorized attempts for 1D3 x 5 minutes). They can switch to a different jackpoint to start a new security tally. Once successful, the decker's icon appears in the virtual landscape of the LTG, from where they can log on to the controlling RTG, a attached PLTG, or any host.

    LOGON TO RTG

        Test: Access

        Utility: Deception

        Action: Complex

        After logging onto an LTG, a decker can log onto its controlling RTG. This is necessary to connect to a different LTG on the same RTG, or a different RTG entirely. The decker makes an Access Test against the RTG's Access Rating. "Local" changes in LTG ratings do not carry over to the RTG. The gamemaster can assign temporary changes to the RTG's ratings if needed. An RTG maintains a single security tally for all activities on all the LTGs it controls. Once on the RTG, the decker can log on to any attached LTG, another RTG, or perform Search RTG and Trace/Tap Call operations.

    MAKE COMCALL

        Test: Files

        Utility: Commlink

        Action: Complex

        This operation allows a decker on an RTG to make a call to any commcode on a controlled LTG. It can also be used to build a secure conference call by moving between multiple RTGs and linking calls together. Each link requires another opposed Files Test. Corporate deckers with a license from the RTG vendor don't need to make tests for this. Trace routines run against the call are treated as trace IC, and the decker's Trace Factor is used for the call. Tricks that work against trace IC, like Redirect Datatrail, can be used to make the call more secure. Another decker cannot use the Trace Comcall operation to trace this call but could use the track utility. The decker can also make a Sensor (Device Rating) Test to detect taps or tracers and an Evasion (Device Rating) Test to neutralize them. This is a profitable sideline for deckers, with a typical charge of 100 nuyen per caller per minute. This is a monitored operation.

    MONITOR SLAVE

        Test: Slave

        Utility: Spoof

        Action: Simple

        This is a monitored operation that lets a decker read data transmitted by a remote device. As long as they maintain the operation, they receive constant updates from things like security cameras or medical scanners.

    NULL OPERATION

        Test: Control

        Utility: Deception

        Action: Complex

        The gamemaster may require this operation when a decker is waiting for something to happen in the Matrix or physical world, or doing anything that requires actions but not System Tests. The gamemaster can also secretly perform these operations. The target number for the opposed Security Test is modified based on the period of inactivity. Less than 10 seconds uses the base Security Value. 10 seconds to a minute adds a +1 modifier. A minute to an hour adds a +2. An hour to 12 hours adds a +4, with an additional +1 for every 12 hours after that. The gamemaster may set a limit on the inactive period to prevent the decker from falling asleep.

    REDIRECT DATATRAIL

        Test: Control

        Utility: Camo

        Action: Complex

        Deckers can perform this operation on any grid to confuse trace IC. The target number for the opposing Security Test is reduced by the decker's trace modifier (see Jackpoints, p. 28). A decker can only leave one redirect on a grid. For each grid with a redirect, the decker's trace factor is reduced by 1, but this doesn't affect the bandwidth modifier for subsequent Redirect Datatrail operations.

    RETRAIN

        Test: Access

        Utility: Commlink

        Action: Free

        This operation allows a decker to change their I/O bandwidth. The Access Rating of the system where the icon is active is used for the Access Test. Target number modifiers and effects on the Trace Factor are determined by the jackpoint (see Jackpoints, p. 28). Deckers can perform this at any time, even while loading data.

    SCAN ICON

        Test: Special

        Utility: Scanner

        Action: Simple

        This operation provides information about a located decker, frame, or SK. The decker makes a Computer Test against the target's Masking Rating. If the target is running a sleaze utility, its rating is subtracted from the scanning decker's scanner utility rating, and the target number is reduced by the difference. If the sleaze program has a higher rating than the scanner program, the target number is increased by the difference. For each success, the decker can choose one of the following: the icon's MPCP Rating, any Persona Rating, or its Response Increase Rating. Identifying an icon requires an Analyze Icon operation first.

    SWAP MEMORY

        Test: None

        Utility: None

        Action: Simple

        This operation loads a new utility program into the deck's active memory and then uploads it to the online icon. Loading to active memory is a Simple Action. If the deck lacks enough active memory or icon bandwidth, the decker must first use a Free Action to unload a program. No tests are required for these actions, as new cyberdecks have unlimited bus speeds between storage and active memory. The utility starts uploading automatically once in active memory. Squeezed or compressed utilities must be decompressed with a Complex Action before they can be used.

    TAP COMCALL

        Test: Special

        Utility: Commlink

        Action: Complex

        This operation allows deckers to find, trace, and tap active commcalls on an LTG. The decker must be active on an RTG that controls the LTG. An Index Test is made to see if any commcodes on the LTG are in use. If a commcode is found, a Control Test can trace the call to its origin or destination, with each success revealing one participant in a conference call. If the call was set up by another decker, the Control Test locates them, and the tracing decker must move to their RTG and use the track utility. To tap and record the call, a decker makes a Files Test. Each minute of recording takes up 1 Mp of storage. If the comm link is scrambled, the decker must decrypt it with an unopposed Computer Test against the Data Encryption System's rating. The decrypt utility reduces the target number, and the number of phones has no effect. If the first test fails, subsequent tests get a +2 modifier. These tests do not affect the security tally. If a phone has a dataline scanner, the decker makes a Computer Test against its rating, reduced by the commlink utility, to fool it with a single success. For multiple scanners, one success is needed for each. This test also does not affect the security tally. Once a call is tapped, the decker can listen and record as they wish. After the call ends, they can stay locked onto any of the commcodes to monitor future calls. New tests are needed to trace or tap new calls and defeat scanners or encryption.

    UPLOAD DATA

        Test: Files

        Utility: Read/Write

        Action: Simple

        This is an ongoing operation that transmits data from a cyberdeck's storage memory to the Matrix. It does not affect active memory. If creating a new file, it is written automatically. If modifying an existing file, an Edit File operation must be performed after the upload. This operation is not used for uploading utilities; that's handled by Swap Memory.

    VALIDATE PASSCODE

        Test: Control

        Utility: Validate

        Action: Complex

        This operation plants a legitimate-looking fake passcode on a host. Once logged on, a decker can use the passcode to perform operations and steal resources. The decker makes a Control Test to validate the passcode, with a +2 modifier for a superuser passcode and a +6 for a supervisor passcode. The gamemaster rolls 1D6 and multiplies it by the successes to determine how many days the passcode is effective. If the passcode is used during a run that raises the host to active alert, the host flags and deletes it.

CYBERCOMBAT

Cybercombat can be engaged in by deckers, IC, SKs, and frames. Icons for system resources and applications cannot attack or be attacked, but deckers can engage them using system operations.

CYBERCOMBAT SEQUENCE

The sequence for cybercombat in Matrix 2.0 is similar to standard SR combat. Characters and icons determine Initiative, then declare and resolve their actions. Matrix Combat Turns are 3 seconds long, aligning with standard Shadowrun turns. Simultaneous actions are resolved in the order of astral, Matrix, then physical actions, with some exceptions. If a decker delays an action to wait for something in the physical world, their action is resolved with the physical actions of that phase. This can be a disadvantage, as combat usually favors the swiftest. Deckers communicating directly with the physical world via voice or datascreen also resolve their actions with the physical actions, a penalty that doesn't apply to those using hitcher electrodes, a shared terminal, or communicating with other personas.

SUBJECTIVE TIME

Characters experience time subjectively in the Matrix. The time spent moving through the environment may feel much longer than the actual game time. A decker performing an Index Test might feel like they've spent hours walking down a long hallway when only a few seconds have passed.

INITIATIVE

Icons with a Reaction attribute roll for Initiative according to standard SR rules (p. 79, SRII).

DECKER INITIATIVE

A decker's Initiative is based on their persona's Reaction attribute. With no enhancements, a decker rolls 1D6 and adds the result to their Reaction. Reality filters, response-increase circuitry, and running on hot decks via DNI all boost a decker's Initiative (see Cyberdecks, p. 81). Physical enhancements like wired reflexes or magical augmentation do not affect Initiative in the Matrix. If a decker is communicating directly with the physical world, they lose 1D6 of Initiative until the link is dropped. This penalty does not apply to communications via hitcher electrodes or to tortoise users.

IC INITIATIVE

An IC program's Initiative is calculated using the formulas in the IC Initiative Table. For IC constructs, use the rating of the lowest-rated IC program in the construct. For a party cluster, determine Initiative for each program separately. If the host's Security Code changes during a fight, the IC programs' Initiative changes accordingly.

IC INITIATIVE TABLE

    Host Security Code: Blue    Initiative: 1D6 + IC Rating
    Host Security Code: Green    Initiative: 2D6 + IC Rating
    Host Security Code: Orange    Initiative: 3D6 + IC Rating
    Host Security Code: Red    Initiative: 4D6 + IC Rating

OTHER PROGRAMS

Smart frames, SKs, and other autonomous expert systems have a Reaction attribute equal to their Core Ratings (see Frames, p. 104, and Artificial Intelligences, p. 138). They roll 1D6 for Initiative unless they have response enhancements. For other programs, assume their Reaction attribute equals their rating and roll 1D6 for Initiative. For programs without ratings, use a flat value of 6.

ACTIONS

An icon can take one Free Action and either two Simple Actions or one Complex Action during a Combat Phase. Deckers can also perform the system operations listed in System Operations, p. 111, and in the System Operations Table, p. 161, which require specific actions to execute.

FREE ACTIONS

Free Actions are simple, almost automatic actions that require little effort.

    Delay Action: Deckers can delay actions per standard SRII rules (pp. 80-81). Rules for resolving delayed actions are in Cybercombat Sequence, p. 120.
    Speak a Word: Standard SRII rules (p. 81) apply to verbal communication. Direct communication with the physical world affects Initiative. Deckers can also "buffer" a message up to 100 words long to a character linked via hitcher electrodes or other devices. The recipient gets the message at the end of the Combat Turn.
    Terminate Download/Upload: A decker can suspend or end a data transmission at any time.
    Unload Program: A decker can remove a program from their active memory at any time, which frees up memory and icon bandwidth for a Swap Memory operation.
    Unsuppress IC: A decker can release IC from suppression at any time, restoring the points used for suppression to their Detection Factor. If the suppression was preventing the security tally from increasing, it does so immediately. If the IC's actions were suspended, it becomes active immediately. (See Suppressing IC, p. 40).

SIMPLE ACTIONS

A Simple Action requires more concentration than a Free Action.

    Attack: A decker can attack an icon with any offensive utility loaded on their deck. IC and other icons attack according to their programming.
    Combat Maneuvers: Deckers and icons can perform any listed combat maneuvers as a Simple Action (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121).
    Improvise Attack: Deckers can use Simple Actions to create attack programs on the fly (see Improvised Attacks, p. 123).

COMPLEX ACTIONS

A Complex Action requires intense concentration on a single task.
    Change Deck Mode: Changing deck mode (see Deck Modes, p. 74) is a Complex Action.


**NON-COMBAT ACTIONS**

For non-combat actions, deckers don't roll for Initiative. Instead, divide the decker's Reaction attribute by 10 (rounded up) to determine the number of actions they can perform each 3-second turn. Add one action for every Initiative die the decker receives in combat beyond the standard 1D6. During each available action the decker can perform one Free Action, and either one Complex Action or two Simple Actions. The decker can perform another Free Action in place of either or both of the Simple Actions. For example, a decker with 2 actions per turn could perform a Logon to Host operation (a Complex Action) and a Retrain operation on his I/O bandwidth (a Free Action) on his first action phase. On the next action, he could perform an Analyze Host operation (a Complex Action). Reactive IC programs that perform tasks at the end of a Combat Turn act after all deckers have performed their allotted actions for a turn.

---

**INITIATING COMBAT**

A decker may initiate combat with any Icon that is "visible" or any icon he has located. Any Icon that attacks a decker automatically becomes visible, unless it successfully performs a combat maneuver to conceal Itself (see Combat Maneuvers) Deckers may locate reactive IC programs by performing the appropriate Analyze operations, and they may locate other deckers by performing Locate Decker operations (see System Operations, p. 114). In addition, other deckers may make themselves visible to a decker by communicating with him, attacking him, or deliberately revealing themselves in some other way. Once a decker is "visible" or located, he remains so unless he makes a successful combat maneuver to evade detection. Proactive IC programs may initiate combat with any decker whose security tally triggers the IC. The IC program can continue to attack until the decker gets off the system or evades detection with a combat maneuver,

---

**COMBAT MANEUVERS**

Deckers, proactive IC, smart frames, and any other self-directed icons can perform combat maneuvers to avoid detection, parry attacks, or gain a position to make more accurate attacks. All combat maneuvers are Simple Actions.

Each combat maneuver requires an opposed test between the icon performing the maneuver and the icon opposing the maneuver. The maneuvering icon makes an Evasion Test. If the maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the program, using the host's Security Value. (Non-IC programs that lack Evasion attributes cannot perform combat maneuvers.)

The opposing Icon makes a Sensor Test. If the maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the icon using the host's Security Value, (Non-IC programs that lack Sensor attributes cannot oppose maneuvers actively. However, if the maneuvering Icon achieves no successes on its test, the maneuver still fails.)

If the maneuvering icon achieves more successes, note the net successes-the number of successes that exceed the opposing test successes, The net successes determine how successfully the icon maneuvered. If the opposing icon achieved an equal or greater number of successes, the combat maneuver fails. If the maneuvering icon has a cloak utility, reduce that icon's target number by the Utility Rating. If the opposing icon has a lock-on utility, reduce its target number by the Utility Rating.

### **EVADE DETECTION**

An icon may perform an evade-detection maneuver to evade an opposing icon that has detected it. A decker must use the Analyze Icon operation to re-detect an IC program that has evaded him with the maneuver. To re-detect personas, frames, or SKs that have evaded him, a decker must use a Locate Decker operation. IC programs re-detect evading icons in a number of Combat Turns equal to the net successes of the icon's Evasion Test. This time is shortened by | turn for each point added to the icon's security tally during the period, The IC program shows up at the end of the last turn of the evasion period, ready for the Initiative step in the next Combat Turn. Deckers may use evade-detection maneuvers to evade trace IC programs during the programs' hunting cycles. These programs cannot be evaded during their location cycles. Other forms of reactive IC cannot be evaded at all.

Cybersushi is on an Orange-8 host when he comes under attack from a killer IC program. He needs a breather to upload a more powerful attack program, so he attempts an Evade IC operation. First, Sushi makes his Evasion Test against the host's Security Value. He has an Evasion attribute of 6, so he rolls 6D6. He also has a Cloak-4 utility, so the target number for the test is 4 (host Security Value - Cloak Rating). Sushi achieves 3 successes. Meanwhile, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the host against Sushi's Evasion Rating. He rolls 8D6 against a Target Number 6 and achieves 1 success. That makes Sushi the winner of the test with 2 net successes. As a result, he evades the killer IC program for 2 Combat Turns. However, the host spots Cybersushi during the next turn as the decker runs a Swap Memory operation. His security tally rises 2 points, which wipes out his evasion period-the killer IC program re-detects him at the end of the turn.

### **PARRY ATTACH**

The parry-attack maneuver enables the maneuvering icon to enhance Its defenses in cybercombar. If the maneuvering icon wins the opposed test, increase target numbers for attacks against the icon by its net successes on the test. The bonus lasts until the next attack by the opposing icon. If the opposing icon performs a position-attack maneuver, the maneuvering icon retains the parry bonus. If either icon performs an evade-detection maneuver, the bonus is lost.

### **POSITION ATTACK**

The position-attack maneuver enables an icon to position Itself for an attack on an opponent, This is a dangerous maneuver that may backfire on an icon. If the maneuvering icon wins the opposed test. the icon may reduce the target number for its next attack by its net successes or Increase the Power of its attack by the net successes. If the opposing icon wins the opposed test, that Icon receives the bonus. The bonus lasts only until the next attack,

Cybersushi has an Evasion attribute of 5 and is running a Cloak-2 utility when he runs into a corp decker with a Sensor attribute of 5 and a Lock-On-3 utility. Sushi tries a position-attack maneuver to get the jump on his opponent. He makes an Evasion Test against a Target Number 3 (opposing icon's Sensor Rating - Sushi's Cloak Rating). His opponent makes a Sensor Test against a Target Number 3 (Sushi's Evasion Rating - opposing icon's Lock-On Rating). Sushi achieves 4 successes on his test, but his opponent achieves 5. As a result, the corp decker may decrease the target number of his next attack against Sushi by 1 or increase the Power of his attack by 1.

Sushi uses his remaining Simple Action in the phase to perform a parry-attack maneuver. The tests are the same, but this time Sushi wiss, with a net success of 1. That increases the target number of the corp decker's attack by 1. The corp decker decides to accept the increased target number and applies his position-attack bonus to the Power of his attack.

---

**RESOLVING ATTACHS**

All cybercombat attacks are Simple Actions: To make an attack, the attacker makes a test with his offensive utility program. (Hacking F'ool dice may be used to augment the program.) The target number for the test depends on two factors: the target icon's status -- Legitimate or Intruding-and the Security Code of the host where the attack occurs. Any decker icon or IC program that has logged onto a system with a valid passcode is considered Legitimate. All other icons are Intruding. The Cybercombat Target Numbers Table provides target numbers for cons based on these factors

Apply any appropriate target-number modifiers from utility options, maneuvers, damage, and so on.

**CYBERCOMBAT TARGET NUMBERS TABLE** 

| Host Security Code | Icon Status Intruder | Legitimate |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ---------- |
| Blue               | 0                    | 3          |
| Green              | 5                    | 4          |
| Orange             | 4                    | 5          |
| Red                | 3                    | 6          |

An Intruding decker may attempt to alter his own target number in the middle of a run by performing a Validate Passcode operation to create a temporary Legitimate persona for himself. This is an ad hoc combat trick-it does not stop IC programs and other programs from attacking or affect System Tests, but it can make the decker harder to hit. The host detects and deletes the faked passcode as soon as the decker logs off. Of course, a decker may log on using a Legitimate passcode or a previously planted faked one. In general, if the decker uses that passcode to get Legitimate status during a fight with the host's own security programs, the host devalidates the passcode when the decker jacks out or logs off. He has blown his cover, so to speak. However, he can use the passcode in combat against Intruding deckers without blowing his cover.

Record the number of successes scored on the Attack Test, because they determine the effects of the attack. The various types of offensive utilities have different effects on their targets. Some reduce specific ratings of the targeted icon, while others inflict damage on a decker's physical body. Any special effects and opposed tests made by the targeted icon are noted in the offensive utility descriptions (see Offensive Utilities, p. 98, in Programs). For offensive utilities that do not inflict special damage, see Icon Damage, below.

### **IMPROVISED ATTACHS**

Under Matrix 2.0 rules, a decker can write an attack program "on the fly" as a Simple Action. Such improvised attack programs may be used for single attacks only-as one-shot utilIties, in other words. The decker sets the attack program's Power by allocating points from his Evasion and/or Bod ratings. Any combination of points is allowed. However, the Power may not exceed the MPCP Rating of the character's cyberdeck. The decker's Evasion and/or Bod ratings remain reduced by the number of points allocated to the attack program until he uses the attack program. If he fails to complete the attack program successfully, the ratings remain reduced until his next action. To finish creating the attack program, the decker makes a Computer Test against a target number equal to the program's Power. On 1 success, the program has a Damage Level of Light: on 2 successes, Moderate: on 3 successes, Serious: 4 or more successes gives the program a Damage Level of Deadly.

### **ICON DAMAGE**

Many offensive utility and IC programs, such as the hog and reveal utilities and the poison and acid IC programs, inflict specialized forms of damage. Rules for resolving and resisting these effects are provided in the entries for those programs (see Programs, p. 94, and Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 38). Other programs, such as attack and killer IC programs, inflict damage per standard Shadowrun rules. Each of these programs has a Damage Code, which consists of a numeric Power and a Damage Level: Light, Moderate, Serious, or Deadly. The Power for such programs is equal to their ratings.

The Damage Level for such IC programs is determined by the host's Security Code, as shown on the IC Damage Table.

**IC DAMAGE TABLE** 

| Host Security Code | IC Damage Level |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| Blue               | Moderate        |
| Green              | Moderate        |
| Orange             | Serious         |
| Red                | Serious         |

For every 2 successes on the attacker's Attack Test, stage up by 1 level the Damage Level of the attack. The Icon that has been hit rolls a Damage Resistance Test using its Bod Rating against a target number equal to the Power of the damage. For IC programs that take damage, make a Damage Resistance Test using the host's Security Value, The armor utility reduces the Power for the test, For every 2 successes on the test, stage down the Damage Level by 1 level.

Cassie is attacked by a Killer-6 program on an Orange host, so she faces 65 damage. To make matters worse, the IC achieves 3 successes on its Attack Test, so the damage stages up to 6D. Cassie is running an Armor-4 utility, which reduces the Power of the attack to 2. Cassie makes a Bod (2) Test and achieves 4 successes. That stages the damage her persona takes down to Moderate.

### **CONDITION MONITORS**

All Icons use a Condition Monitor. Each Condition Monitor has 10 boxes, which are filled in as the icon takes damage per the Condition Monitor Table, Once all 10 boxes are filled, the icon crashes. If the icon is a persona, the persona's decker Is dumped from the Matrix. The decker is vulnerable to dump shock (see Dump Shock, below) and possibly other effects (when black IC kills an Icon, It does not disconnect the deckerIt just makes it easier to fry his brain).

**CONDITION MONITOR TABLE** 

| Damage Level | Fill in: |
| ------------ | -------- |
| Light        | 1 box    |
| Moderate     | 2 boxes  |
| Serious      | 3 boxes  |
| Deadly       | 6 boxes  |

### **SIMSENSE OVERLOAD**

Whenever a decker's icon takes damage from white or gray IC, the decker's physical body may suffer Stun damage through a resonance effect over the ASIST interface. This can only occur on hot decks. Cool decks and tortoises are immune to this effect. To determine whether the decker takes simsense overload damage, he makes a Willpower Test against a target number based on the damage taken by his icon. These target numbers are provided in the Overload Damage Target Numbers table. If the decker is running hot with a DNI-only interface, increase the target number by 2. If the deck has an ICCM, reduce the target number by 2. Any icon that takes Deadly damage crashes automatically and exposes the decker to dump shock. If the Willpower Test fails, the decker suffers a Light Stun wound and fills in I box on his Mental Condition Monitor. Simsense overload damage is not an issue when dealing with black IC. Any damage the decker suffers in that case Is no side effect!

**OVERLOAD DAMAGE TARGET NUMBERS** 

| Icon Damage Level | Target Number |
| ----------------- | ------------- |
| Light             | 2             |
| Moderate          | 3             |
| Serious           | 5             |

### **DUMP SHOCK**

When a decker is crashed off the Matrix or jacks out without performing a Graceful Logoff operation, he risks Stun damage from dump shock. The Power of the damage equals the host's Security Value. This measures the shock of the sudden transition from virtual to physical reality. The Damage Level is determined by the host's Security Code, as shown on the Dump Shock Damage Levels table. If the decker was running a cool deck when dumped, reduce the damage Power by 2 and lower the Damage Level by I level. If the deck was equipped with an ICCM, reduce the Damage Code in the same manner. These reductions are cumulative, so a cool deck equipped with an ICCM provides a 4-point reduction to the Power and lowers the Damage Level by 2 levels. Tortoise users are Immune to dump shock.

**DUMP SHOCK DAMAGE LEVELS** 

| Host Security Code | Damage Level |
| ------------------ | ------------ |
| Blue               | Light        |
| Green              | Moderate     |
| Orange             | Serious      |
| Red                | Deadly       |

NON-COMBAT ACTIONS

For non-combat actions, deckers don't roll for Initiative. Instead, divide the decker's Reaction attribute by 10 (rounded up) to determine the number of actions they can perform each 3-second turn. Add one action for every Initiative die the decker receives in combat beyond the standard 1D6. During each available action the decker can perform one Free Action, and either one Complex Action or two Simple Actions. The decker can perform another Free Action in place of either or both of the Simple Actions. For example, a decker with 2 actions per turn could perform a Logon to Host operation (a Complex Action) and a Retrain operation on his I/O bandwidth (a Free Action) on his first action phase. On the next action, he could perform an Analyze Host operation (a Complex Action). Reactive IC programs that perform tasks at the end of a Combat Turn act after all deckers have performed their allotted actions for a turn.

INITIATING COMBAT

A decker may initiate combat with any Icon that is "visible" or any icon he has located. Any Icon that attacks a decker automatically becomes visible, unless it successfully performs a combat maneuver to conceal Itself (see Combat Maneuvers) Deckers may locate reactive IC programs by performing the appropriate Analyze operations, and they may locate other deckers by performing Locate Decker operations (see System Operations, p. 114). In addition, other deckers may make themselves visible to a decker by communicating with him, attacking him, or deliberately revealing themselves in some other way. Once a decker is "visible" or located, he remains so unless he makes a successful combat maneuver to evade detection. Proactive IC programs may initiate combat with any decker whose security tally triggers the IC. The IC program can continue to attack until the decker gets off the system or evades detection with a combat maneuver,

COMBAT MANEUVERS

Deckers, proactive IC, smart frames, and any other self-directed icons can perform combat maneuvers to avoid detection, parry attacks, or gain a position to make more accurate attacks. All combat maneuvers are Simple Actions.

Each combat maneuver requires an opposed test between the icon performing the maneuver and the icon opposing the maneuver. The maneuvering icon makes an Evasion Test. If the maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the program, using the host's Security Value. (Non-IC programs that lack Evasion attributes cannot perform combat maneuvers.)

The opposing Icon makes a Sensor Test. If the maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the icon using the host's Security Value, (Non-IC programs that lack Sensor attributes cannot oppose maneuvers actively. However, if the maneuvering Icon achieves no successes on its test, the maneuver still fails.)

If the maneuvering icon achieves more successes, note the net successes-the number of successes that exceed the opposing test successes, The net successes determine how successfully the icon maneuvered. If the opposing icon achieved an equal or greater number of successes, the combat maneuver fails. If the maneuvering icon has a cloak utility, reduce that icon's target number by the Utility Rating. If the opposing icon has a lock-on utility, reduce its target number by the Utility Rating.

EVADE DETECTION

An icon may perform an evade-detection maneuver to evade an opposing icon that has detected it. A decker must use the Analyze Icon operation to re-detect an IC program that has evaded him with the maneuver. To re-detect personas, frames, or SKs that have evaded him, a decker must use a Locate Decker operation. IC programs re-detect evading icons in a number of Combat Turns equal to the net successes of the icon's Evasion Test. This time is shortened by | turn for each point added to the icon's security tally during the period, The IC program shows up at the end of the last turn of the evasion period, ready for the Initiative step in the next Combat Turn. Deckers may use evade-detection maneuvers to evade trace IC programs during the programs' hunting cycles. These programs cannot be evaded during their location cycles. Other forms of reactive IC cannot be evaded at all.

Cybersushi is on an Orange-8 host when he comes under attack from a killer IC program. He needs a breather to upload a more powerful attack program, so he attempts an Evade IC operation. First, Sushi makes his Evasion Test against the host's Security Value. He has an Evasion attribute of 6, so he rolls 6D6. He also has a Cloak-4 utility, so the target number for the test is 4 (host Security Value - Cloak Rating). Sushi achieves 3 successes. Meanwhile, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for the host against Sushi's Evasion Rating. He rolls 8D6 against a Target Number 6 and achieves 1 success. That makes Sushi the winner of the test with 2 net successes. As a result, he evades the killer IC program for 2 Combat Turns. However, the host spots Cybersushi during the next turn as the decker runs a Swap Memory operation. His security tally rises 2 points, which wipes out his evasion period-the killer IC program re-detects him at the end of the turn.

PARRY ATTACH

The parry-attack maneuver enables the maneuvering icon to enhance Its defenses in cybercombar. If the maneuvering icon wins the opposed test, increase target numbers for attacks against the icon by its net successes on the test. The bonus lasts until the next attack by the opposing icon. If the opposing icon performs a position-attack maneuver, the maneuvering icon retains the parry bonus. If either icon performs an evade-detection maneuver, the bonus is lost.

POSITION ATTACK

The position-attack maneuver enables an icon to position Itself for an attack on an opponent, This is a dangerous maneuver that may backfire on an icon. If the maneuvering icon wins the opposed test. the icon may reduce the target number for its next attack by its net successes or Increase the Power of its attack by the net successes. If the opposing icon wins the opposed test, that Icon receives the bonus. The bonus lasts only until the next attack,

Cybersushi has an Evasion attribute of 5 and is running a Cloak-2 utility when he runs into a corp decker with a Sensor attribute of 5 and a Lock-On-3 utility. Sushi tries a position-attack maneuver to get the jump on his opponent. He makes an Evasion Test against a Target Number 3 (opposing icon's Sensor Rating - Sushi's Cloak Rating). His opponent makes a Sensor Test against a Target Number 3 (Sushi's Evasion Rating - opposing icon's Lock-On Rating). Sushi achieves 4 successes on his test, but his opponent achieves 5. As a result, the corp decker may decrease the target number of his next attack against Sushi by 1 or increase the Power of his attack by 1.

Sushi uses his remaining Simple Action in the phase to perform a parry-attack maneuver. The tests are the same, but this time Sushi wiss, with a net success of 1. That increases the target number of the corp decker's attack by 1. The corp decker decides to accept the increased target number and applies his position-attack bonus to the Power of his attack.

RESOLVING ATTACHS

All cybercombat attacks are Simple Actions: To make an attack, the attacker makes a test with his offensive utility program. (Hacking F'ool dice may be used to augment the program.) The target number for the test depends on two factors: the target icon's status -- Legitimate or Intruding-and the Security Code of the host where the attack occurs. Any decker icon or IC program that has logged onto a system with a valid passcode is considered Legitimate. All other icons are Intruding. The Cybercombat Target Numbers Table provides target numbers for cons based on these factors

Apply any appropriate target-number modifiers from utility options, maneuvers, damage, and so on.

CYBERCOMBAT TARGET NUMBERS TABLE

| Host Security Code | Icon Status Intruder | Legitimate |
|---|---|---|
| Blue | 0 | 3 |
| Green | 5 | 4 |
| Orange | 4 | 5 |
| Red | 3 | 6 |

An Intruding decker may attempt to alter his own target number in the middle of a run by performing a Validate Passcode operation to create a temporary Legitimate persona for himself. This is an ad hoc combat trick-it does not stop IC programs and other programs from attacking or affect System Tests, but it can make the decker harder to hit. The host detects and deletes the faked passcode as soon as the decker logs off. Of course, a decker may log on using a Legitimate passcode or a previously planted faked one. In general, if the decker uses that passcode to get Legitimate status during a fight with the host's own security programs, the host devalidates the passcode when the decker jacks out or logs off. He has blown his cover, so to speak. However, he can use the passcode in combat against Intruding deckers without blowing his cover.

Record the number of successes scored on the Attack Test, because they determine the effects of the attack. The various types of offensive utilities have different effects on their targets. Some reduce specific ratings of the targeted icon, while others inflict damage on a decker's physical body. Any special effects and opposed tests made by the targeted icon are noted in the offensive utility descriptions (see Offensive Utilities, p. 98, in Programs). For offensive utilities that do not inflict special damage, see Icon Damage, below.

IMPROVISED ATTACHS

Under Matrix 2.0 rules, a decker can write an attack program "on the fly" as a Simple Action. Such improvised attack programs may be used for single attacks only-as one-shot utilIties, in other words. The decker sets the attack program's Power by allocating points from his Evasion and/or Bod ratings. Any combination of points is allowed. However, the Power may not exceed the MPCP Rating of the character's cyberdeck. The decker's Evasion and/or Bod ratings remain reduced by the number of points allocated to the attack program until he uses the attack program. If he fails to complete the attack program successfully, the ratings remain reduced until his next action. To finish creating the attack program, the decker makes a Computer Test against a target number equal to the program's Power. On 1 success, the program has a Damage Level of Light: on 2 successes, Moderate: on 3 successes, Serious: 4 or more successes gives the program a Damage Level of Deadly.

ICON DAMAGE

Many offensive utility and IC programs, such as the hog and reveal utilities and the poison and acid IC programs, inflict specialized forms of damage. Rules for resolving and resisting these effects are provided in the entries for those programs (see Programs, p. 94, and Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 38). Other programs, such as attack and killer IC programs, inflict damage per standard Shadowrun rules. Each of these programs has a Damage Code, which consists of a numeric Power and a Damage Level: Light, Moderate, Serious, or Deadly. The Power for such programs is equal to their ratings.

The Damage Level for such IC programs is determined by the host's Security Code, as shown on the IC Damage Table.

IC DAMAGE TABLE

| Host Security Code | IC Damage Level |
|---|---|
| Blue | Moderate |
| Green | Moderate |
| Orange | Serious |
| Red | Serious |

For every 2 successes on the attacker's Attack Test, stage up by 1 level the Damage Level of the attack. The Icon that has been hit rolls a Damage Resistance Test using its Bod Rating against a target number equal to the Power of the damage. For IC programs that take damage, make a Damage Resistance Test using the host's Security Value, The armor utility reduces the Power for the test, For every 2 successes on the test, stage down the Damage Level by 1 level.

Cassie is attacked by a Killer-6 program on an Orange host, so she faces 65 damage. To make matters worse, the IC achieves 3 successes on its Attack Test, so the damage stages up to 6D. Cassie is running an Armor-4 utility, which reduces the Power of the attack to 2. Cassie makes a Bod (2) Test and achieves 4 successes. That stages the damage her persona takes down to Moderate.

CONDITION MONITORS

All Icons use a Condition Monitor. Each Condition Monitor has 10 boxes, which are filled in as the icon takes damage per the Condition Monitor Table, Once all 10 boxes are filled, the icon crashes. If the icon is a persona, the persona's decker Is dumped from the Matrix. The decker is vulnerable to dump shock (see Dump Shock, below) and possibly other effects (when black IC kills an Icon, It does not disconnect the deckerIt just makes it easier to fry his brain).

CONDITION MONITOR TABLE

| Damage Level | Fill in: |
|---|---|
| Light | 1 box |
| Moderate | 2 boxes |
| Serious | 3 boxes |
| Deadly | 6 boxes |

SIMSENSE OVERLOAD

Whenever a decker's icon takes damage from white or gray IC, the decker's physical body may suffer Stun damage through a resonance effect over the ASIST interface. This can only occur on hot decks. Cool decks and tortoises are immune to this effect. To determine whether the decker takes simsense overload damage, he makes a Willpower Test against a target number based on the damage taken by his icon. These target numbers are provided in the Overload Damage Target Numbers table. If the decker is running hot with a DNI-only interface, increase the target number by 2. If the deck has an ICCM, reduce the target number by 2. Any icon that takes Deadly damage crashes automatically and exposes the decker to dump shock. If the Willpower Test fails, the decker suffers a Light Stun wound and fills in I box on his Mental Condition Monitor. Simsense overload damage is not an issue when dealing with black IC. Any damage the decker suffers in that case Is no side effect!

OVERLOAD DAMAGE TARGET NUMBERS

| Icon Damage Level | Target Number |
|---|---|
| Light | 2 |
| Moderate | 3 |
| Serious | 5 |

DUMP SHOCK

When a decker is crashed off the Matrix or jacks out without performing a Graceful Logoff operation, he risks Stun damage from dump shock. The Power of the damage equals the host's Security Value. This measures the shock of the sudden transition from virtual to physical reality. The Damage Level is determined by the host's Security Code, as shown on the Dump Shock Damage Levels table. If the decker was running a cool deck when dumped, reduce the damage Power by 2 and lower the Damage Level by I level. If the deck was equipped with an ICCM, reduce the Damage Code in the same manner. These reductions are cumulative, so a cool deck equipped with an ICCM provides a 4-point reduction to the Power and lowers the Damage Level by 2 levels. Tortoise users are Immune to dump shock.

DUMP SHOCK DAMAGE LEVELS

| Host Security Code | Damage Level |
|---|---|
| Blue | Light |
| Green | Moderate |
| Orange | Serious |
| Red | Deadly |

Semi-autonomous knowbots, or SKs, are expert systems with high-density, random-decision pathway capacities, SKs have limited extrapolatory ability, and it has been posited that SK architecture In a sufficiently powerful computing engine-an ultraviolet level host-might achieve "critical mass" connectivity In Its holographic neural network and become a true artificial Intelligence. Whether the theory of critical mass connectivity Is valid or not remains unknown, but rumors persist of functioning Als-truly sentient beings born of and living in the Matrix.

SEMI-AUTONOMOUS KNOWBOTS

SK technology was pioneered by Renraku, but despite that corporation's attempt to keep the algorithms "maximally proprietary" (I.e., top secret), SKs have been reported in use by such megacorporations as Fuchi and Aztechnology, and by SSET in Tir na nOg. SK programs are capable of self-directed data transport on the Matrix. In other words, they can move. In effect, SKs are mobile virtual machines, personas without cyberdecks,

So far, stable SK programs have been developed only under the leadership of designers of genius. Developing these codes is beyond the capabilities of canned algorithm generators and comp-sci expert systems In game terms, programming SKs requires the use of a Red- 10 or higher mainframe and programming resources equal to half-a-dozen top programmers with Computer Skills of 12 or higher. SKs must be custom-programmed for specific missions. For example, a hunter-killer SK intended to assault a Fuchi data fortress must be almost completely rewritten to go after an AZT asset or assassinate a particularly irritating decker. SKs should show up only rarely in Shadowrun games, Their presence in an adventure represents a serious expenditure of Matrix assets by a major power, As a result, SKs should be limited to major adventures or campaigns that involve powerful megacorps or other equally potent organizations or individuals.

SHS AND NATIVE HOSTS

An SK is "born" within a native host-a system created by a master program on a high-powered mainframe, The mainframe must be of equal or greater processing power than the master program, which is why corps don't scatter too many of these around-they consume Immense amounts of machine time. All SKs repair any damage to their Condition Monitors and Persona Ratings by logging on to their native hosts. If an SK is dam- aged while on its native host, It may receive the effects of a medic of restore program at a rating equal to Its MPCP by spending a Complex Action, Such repairs do not require points from the SK's Utility Pool Naturally, SKs have passcodes for their native host systems, The excessive demands on the mainframe of maintaining the native host make SKs a cost-prohibitive way of maintaining "unkillable" IC. However, most observers believe that ongoing research will one day yield more efficient master programs that will make such arrangements feasible.

SH RATINGS

The MPCP Rating of an SK equals ID6 + 6. The MPCP Rating multiplied by 3 equals the maximum total of the SK's Bod Evasion, Masking, and Sensor programs. No single Personā Rating may exceed the MPCP Rating. All SKs have a Computer Skill equal to their MPCP Ratings

SKs do not load utility programs, Instead, every SK has a Utility Pool of points equal to its MPCP Rating + ID6. (See Utility Pool, below, for rules on allocating Utility Pool points.) The following represent a few typical SK configurations, though the gamemaster may design SKs with any number of Persona-Rating distributions because each is written for a specif- ic mission:

    MPCP-7/6/5/5/5

        Computer Skill: 7

        Pool: 8 to 13

    MPCP-8/6/6/6/6

        Computer Skill: 8

        Pool: 9 to 17

    MPCP-9/8/7/6/6

        Computer Skill: 9

        Pool: 10 to 15

    MPCP-10/8/8/7/7

        Computer Skill: 10

        Pool: 11 to 16

    MPCP-11/9/8/8/8

        Computer Skill: 11

        Pool: 12 to 17

    MPCP-12/9/9/9/9

        Computer Skill: 12

        Pool: 13 to 18

UTILITY POOL

An SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool points to any utility program for use as the need arises (assume that SKs have access to all utilities at all times). Allocating points is a Free Action: An SK can mimic any operational utility program by using its Utility Pool points. Each point from the pool acts as I Program Rating Point. The maximum rating for any utility is equal to the SK's MPCP Rating. Allocating Utility Pool points is a Free Action,

Almost all SK utilities work the same as standard utilities with the following exceptions:

    Black hammer and killjoy programs require 2 Utility Pool points for each Program Rating Point.

    Any Utility Pool points allo- cated to restore or medic programs cannot be re-allocated until the SK returns to its native host and regenerates its code.

    Finally, an SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool points to the SK's Initiative Rating.

SH RESPONSE

An SK's base Reaction Rating equals its MPCP Rating, with ID6 for Initiative. The SK's controlling player may increase the SK's Initiative by allocating Utility Pool points: 1 point provides 2D6, 3 points provide 3D6, and 5 points provides 4D6-the maximum increase allowed.

RUNNING AN SK

An SK has a specific mission objective, which may be sim- ple or complex. Mission objectives may Involve single Matrix runs or extended series of intrusions until the program locates its ultimate objective. In the Matrix, SKs behave like fanatically ded- icated deckers with no sense of personal survival. The SK may be a combat monster, a cyberspy that depends on stealth-anything that enables it to achieve its mission objective.

SKs are subject to damage and destruction just like any other icons, When the SK's Condition Monitor is filled, the pro- gram crashes and is gone. The programs have no fear of death, of course, but their parameters make them evade or avoid com- bat if it seems likely that they will crash before fulfilling their objectives,

SKs cannot jack out when the going gets rough. They must perform Graceful Logoff operations to leave hosts and Logon to Host operations to access their native hosts and reach "safety." However, SKs are typically programmed NOT to return to their native hosts if doing so might create incriminating datatrails to their creators

If an SK is destroyed on a mission, of course, its creators can generate another one on the native host. Doing so is expensive, but it costs less than paying off a corpdecker's life Insurance policy.

TRUE AI

True artificial intelligence (Al) programs are fully self-aware, self-sustaining, immensely powerful Matrix programs. Ultimately, every gamemaster must decide how many-if any- Als he wants to introduce into his game. Generally. Als should be incredibly rare. Nothing will take the mystery out of this new life-form faster than having an Al turn out to be the "threat of the week" every time the players turn around, If an Al is involved in an adventure, the gamemaster should consider carefully why the program is taking a hand in events, what it expects to get, and how it will deal with any threats to its safety that might arise. Indeed, In most cases an Al will go to great lengths to prevent deckers from discovering its true identity,

Of course, the shadows have long been rife with rumors of living programs, so an Al may decide its secret is safe-after all, anything the player characters say may be discounted as just another rant by some deckhead who's running his ASIST power a little too hot. Of course, an entity that can transfer funds from anywhere on the Matrix into credsticks and e-mail directives to human hirelings can easily use more forceful means of silencing troublesome Matrix runners. The weakest form of newborn Al would be on a par with an SK, but with self-regenerating ability-perhaps the power to cre- ate a native host environment on any sufficiently powerful com- puter. More powerful Als might possess the ability to weave together wasted memory, dataspace, and distributed processing power on scores of hosts into virtual "pocket universes" in cyber- space-ultraviolet systems independent of any single host, sys- tems that are everywhere and nowhere,

In addition to all the ratings that SKs possess, Als also have Threat Ratings. The Threat Rating may be used as extra dice for all the Al's tests, in the same manner as physical characters' Threat Ratings. A typical newborn Al has a Threat Rating of 1; more mature Als have Threat Ratings of 4 and up. The main thing to remember when roleplaying Als is chat these programs exist independently of human control. They are not restricted to any single mainframe. They are self-aware, self- directing, self-sustaining life-forms. In effect, they are superhu- man deckers with superhuman Matrix powers, unburdened by physical bodies. Of course, Als are not human, and their con- sciousness and motivations may just be their most mysterious, Incomprehensible aspects.

Consider the otaku, the so-called children of the Fast coming int Inheritance, the oldest kne otaku are in their late teens today. And their numbers keep growing some otaku reportedly go under the laser for their first Jack as young as seven or eight. No one knows for certain. however, how many otaku exist of their true Influence on the Matrix. In fact, many observers deny the existence of the otaku altogether. Despite the lack of statistically significant evidence, rumors that these mysterious individuals ply their remarkable skills in the net refuse to die out of the decker community. The role of the otaku in his Shadowrun game is entirely up to the gamemaster. He may choose to leave them offstage- almost legends, like those presented in Denver, The City of Shadows, with powers and limitations unknown to the players, Or the gamemaster may use the model presented here, but limit the otaku to non-player-character roles. Or the gamemaster may allow players to create otaku characters.

BECOMING OTAKU

Some experts claim that several otaku communities exist, each with its own distinctive subculture. However, all share certain behavior patterns. First, the otaku communities seem to select new members according to a highly intuitive process. In most cases, it seems that established community members bring in recruits from the streets, prompted to do so by some inner voice. Many otaku recruits spend their earliest years scrabbling for basic survival in the worst barrens of Seattle, Denver, and DeeCee. Some rumors tell of children as young as two or three found on the doorstep of otaku communities. Once a child is accepted into an otaku community, he undergoes a probationary period. During this time, he begins to learn the ways of the Matrix. Candidates begin hands-on Matrix runs almost at once. They start with tortoises, then move up to 'trode connections to live decks. After an unspecified period of time, a recruit either leaves the otaku community or accepts a datajack implant and begins running on hot decks. By this time, most otaku are the equals of veteran deckers. Many candidates stop at this point, leave the community and go on to become novahot deckers, programmers, and deck- meisters. Others-those who show the deepest, most profound- ly Imprinted understanding of the Matrix-undergo an experi- ence which changes them forever. Those who experience the so- called Deep Resonance become capable of interacting with cyberspace using only an implanted digital/neurological ASIST converter and their bare brains. These otaku are known among deckers as technoshamans and cyberadepts.

THE DEEP RESONANCE

Otaku who experience the Deep Resonance are capable of running the Matrix without cyberdecks. Apparently, the Deep Resonance transforms the individual, just as an awakening of mag- ical power transforms a latent shaman. In fact, some alleged otaku who have spoken of this event use terms reminiscent of the totemic experience of the shaman. Others speak of suddenly perceiving interlocking energies and formulae, in the manner of a mage. Both sets of experiences seem to indicate that the otaku forms a virtually mystical relationship with the Matrix and begins to view the nets as a living entity. Whatever the reality behind the Deep Resonance experience may be. It appears to cause permanent neu- rological change in the otaku that permits "decking"without a deck. The neural interface of the otaku's implanted datajack begins to interact with the redundant holographic capacity of the brain as If it were a bioprocess computer-which, of course, it is,

BUILDING AN OTAKU

Otaku may be of any race. Human otaku must assign Priority A to Resources, Metahuman otaku must assign Priority B to Resources, or A if their gamemaster allows the More Metahumans option (p. 46, SRII). The otaku character does not receive the usual benefits of Priority A or B Resources. See Allocating Resources, p. 145, Magic is Priority E for otaku. There is no known instance of a magically active otaku. Human otaku assign Priority D to Race, and must allocate Skills and Attributes berween Priorities B and C. Metahuman otaku in a standard game must allocate Skills and Attributes between Priorities C and D.

ALLOCATING ATTRIBUTES

The racial maximums for otaku characters' Mental Attributes are raised by 1. Reduce racial maximums for Physical Attributes by 1. These modifications reflect potentials that seem to be inherent in the children chosen to be otaku. If a player allocates only | point each to all of the character's Physical Attributes and halves his racial maximums in those attributes (round fractions up), he receives 2 extra Attribute Points to allocate to his Mental Attributes any way he wishes Also in this case, increase the racial maximums for the charac- ter's Mental Attributes by a total of 2 rather than 1. This repre- sents a common pattern among many otaku, whose subnormal physical development, even disabilities, are coupled with extremely high IQs and determination

ALLOCATING SHILLS

An otaku must allocate at least 6 and no more than 8 points to his starting Computer Skill. He may concentrate in Software or specialize in Decking.

Any Channel skill (see Channels, below) may have a begin- ning Rating of 6. One other Channel skill may have a Rating 5. and a third Channel skill may have a Rating 4. The beginning rat- ings of all remaining Channel skills may not exceed 3. The only Etiquette skills the otaku may possess when he enters the game are Matrix and Street. All these restrictions apply only when creating an otaku character. Players are free to improve skills during the game to make the otaku more well-rounded. Remember that most otaku at the beginning of their careers, are a weird mix of nearly autis- tic street kid and sophisticated techhead-with extremely limit- ed life experiences. These rules are designed to simulate that profile.

Channels

Otaku learn five special skills that act as operational utilities when the otaku perform System Tests. These skills, called channels, are named for the five subsystems of Matrix computers Access, Control, Index, Files, and Slave. Whenever an otaku makes a required Subsystem Test during a system operation, he uses the appropriate channel to lower the test target number. For example. an Analyze Security operation requires a Control Test. A normal decker could lower the target number for the test with an analyze utility. An otaku with Control Channel would use the Control Channel Rating instead.

When creating an otaku character, a player receives a number of points equal to the average of his Mental Attributes i (Intelligence - Will + Charisma) + 3. round up). He can distribute these points among his channels as he wishes. Regular skill points can also be used to increase the channel ratings. Once the otaku character is in the game, the channels can be Improved like any other skills, using Karma Points. The basic channels are general skills. Concentrations that mimic the action of each specific utility exist as well. For example, Control Channel (Analyze) would only be effective when making Control Tests for System Operations that normally require ant analyze utility, such as Analyze Host and Analyze IC operations. Specializations for the otaku channels are limited to a single operation-Files Channel (Edit File), for example.

ALLOCATING RESOURCES

The high Resource priority for otaku Is dedicated to their skill benefits, their background, and the toll exacted by the Deep Resonance experience. Therefore, an otaku character receives only 5,000 nuyen for additional outfitting, as if his Resources were Priority D.

PROGRAMMING DAYS

Every otaku receives an allotment of days that he may spend programming utilities according to the rules for Complex Forms, below. The allotment equals the character's Computer Skill multiplied by 3. In addition, he receives the standard otaku task bonus: (Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) + 4.

The player can allocate these days any way he likes. Any programs in progress at the start of play can be finished during the game, as with any incomplete task.

LIVING PERSONA

The Deep Resonance creates the otaku's icon-his living persona-based on the character's Mental characteristics. The appearance of the living persona usually follows the customs of the otaku community where the character was raised.

    MPCP: (Intelligence Rating + Willpower Rating + Charisma Rating) + 3 (round up)

    Bod: Willpower Rating

    Evasion: Intelligence Rating

    Masking: (Willpower Rating + Charisma Rating) = 2 (round up)

    Sensor: Intelligence Rating

    Response: (Intelligence Rating +Willpower Rating) + 2 (round up) - 3D6 Initiative

    Armor: Willpower Rating

    Hardening: Willpower Rating + 2, round up

    I/O Speed: Intelligence Rating × 100 Mp

ENHANCED ATTRIBUTES

Cyberware that Improves an otaku's Mental Attribute adds its effect directly to the living persona's ratings. For example, an otaku who receives a Cerebral Booster-2 implant would modify his living persona's ratings to reflect his increased Intelligence Rating

Improvements to the Mental Attributes bought with Karma Points raise the living persona's ratings as well. The aspects of Charisma that operate in the living persona are self-image and self-confidence. Cosmetic aspects are trivial in this regard. Therefore, any purely cosmetic enhancements to an otaku's Charisma Rating, or those aimed at enhancing Social Skills, do not affect the living persona ratings. For example, tal- lored pheromones (p. 18, Shadowtech), do not increase an otaku's living persona ratings. For reasons yet unknown, magical enhancements do not affect the living persona. They affect only the otaku's actions in the physical world.

RESPONSE

An otaku's Reaction Rating in the Matrix is equal to the average of his Intelligence and Willpower ratings, He receives 3D6 for Matrix Initiative.

ARMOR/HARDENING

The living persona's online Armor and Hardening ratings against gray or black IC are based on the otaku's Willpower Rating. Both can be raised by creating the appropriate Complex Forms.

COMPLEX FORMS

In addition to the five channels, otaku can "program" versions of other operational utilities for their own use. The otaku call such utilities complex forms. In reality, the otaku does not actually "program" a complex form-he alters the holographic nerve com- plexes of his own brain to produce the effects of the program. In game terms, however, an otaku creating a complex form follows a five-step process. The steps are: selecting the complex form rating, paying necessary Karma Points, determining the complex form size, calculating the base time for carrying out the task, and then performing the task.

The rating of a complex form may not exceed the otaku's Computer Skill or an appropriate concentration or specialization of that skill. After selecting the complex-form rating, the otaku must pay a number of Karma Points equal to the rating

Next, determine the size of the complex form. The size is calculated in the same manner as a program size, using the fol- lowing formula:

(Complex form rating^2 x utility multiplier) + (option rating^2 + option multiplier) - size in Mp

The utility multiplier is the multiplier of the operational utility the complex form mimics. Otaku may also Include options with a complex form, as indicated in the formula. However, options such as optimization, squeeze, and other space-savers are nei- ther required nor allowed with complex forms. Remember, the complex form is not stored on a deck-it's stored in the otaku's brain. The complex form size is used only to determine the base time for creating the complex form, not for storage or uploading.

After determining the complex form size, calculate the base time for the task, using the following formula:

Complex form size x 2 - base time in days

The otaku may reduce the base time by using his otaku task bonus:

(Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) divided by 4 (round up) - otaku task bonus

The otaku task bonus effectively reduces the number of days needed to complete the task, just like a standard task bonus (see Task Bonuses, p. 77 in Deckers, for an explanation of task bonuses). In addition, an otaku may add I point to his task bonus by spending a number of Karma Points equal to the complex form rating. For example, an otaku creating a Rating 7 complex form could spend 7 Karma Points to increase his task bonus by 1 point. The same otaku could spend 14 Karma Points to Increase his task bonus by 2 points, and so on. After applying all task bonuses to the base time, the otaku spends any of his allotted programming days to perform the task of "programming" the complex form into his brain.

The base time for upgrading a complex form is calculated in the same manner as base times for upgrades of standard pro- grams (see Upgrades, p. 107 in Programs), When upgrading a complex form. the original version of the program keeps work- ing normally until the programming task is completed. At that time, the form's new rating or features kick in. When upgrading a form, the otaku must spend a number of Karma Points equal to the final rating of the upgraded form. The otaku cannot upgrade his persona or MPCP ratings as complex forms, because these features are pegged directly to his Mental Attributes. However, an otaku can upgrade his Armor and Hardening ratings. The otaku must upgrade based on his Inherent ratings, For example, if an otaku has Willpower-6, he has Armor-6 automatically. To upgrade his armor as a complex form, the otaku must upgrade it to 7 or higher.

SPRITES

The otaku call program frames sprites, and reputedly make wide use of them. An otaku creates frame cores per standard rules (see Frames, p. 105 in Programs), Otaku may not use frame cores created by another individual. Each otaku must create his own. Additionally, the otaku must spend a number of Karma Points equal to the frame Core Rating,

After completing a frame core, the otaku can load it with any complex form he possesses, as well as operational utilities. The rating of a complex form on the sprite may not exceed the otaku's own rating in that form. Similarly, the rating of any oper- ational utility loaded onto the sprite may not exceed the otaku's rating In the corresponding channel. When loading operational utilities, the otaku follows the standard rules for loading a frame (see Frames. p. 105, in Programs). At this point, the otaku has the option of spending a num- ber of Karma Points equal to the sprite's complex form and util- ity ratings to strengthen the sprite. If the otaku does so, the sprite becomes temporarily disabled if it crashes. The sprite remains intact and becomes available again as soon as the otaku jacks out of the system. If the otaku does not spend these Karma Points, the sprite is permanently wiped clean if it crashes. The frame core survives intact, but all complex forms and utilities must be reloaded.

OTAKU AND THE SOTA

The Deep Resonance experience enables otaku to continu- ously adapt to changes in the Matrix (some otaku claim that the Deep Resonance itself causes all change in the Matrix). Therefore, otaku are always in synch with the SOTA and do not have to take any action when it advances.

OTAKU AND DAMAGE

The intimate link between the otaku and his living persona created by the Deep Resonance experience also makes otaku more vulnerable to damage than standard deckers. Any damage to an otaku's icon condition monitor also does damage to the otaku's Mental Condition Monitor, Black IC programs attack the otaku's Physical Condition Monitor, just as black IC does against normal deckers:

Gray IC is especially dangerous to otaku. If the living per- sona suffers permanent damage to a Persona Rating, the rating remains reduced until the otaku can upgrade it back to Its origi- nal level-this is the one exception to the rule that otaku can't program their Persona Ratings. On the other hand, this pro- gramming task does not require Karma Points, only time.

Damage to a complex form caused by tar IC or hog pro- grams puts the form out of action until the otaku can jack out. Complex forms regenerate from such damage at a rate of 1 point per hour, but do not recover at all if the otaku is suffering from damage to either his Mental or Physical Condition Monitor, The otaku must heal Condition Monitor damage before his complex forms regenerate.

On the upside, an otaku's channels are not vulnerable to tar IC and hog programs. An otaku can use his control channel all he likes in the presence of tar baby, and the IC will not react to it. Additionally, otaku are immune to actual virus codes, such as worm programs.

PLAYING AN OTAKU

You don't know who birthed you, whether they dumped you or died on you. Didn't make much difference back there. Cold and hunger were your heritage, scrounging half-spoiled stuffers out of trash dumps, hiding from the bigger kids who'd take them away. From time to time, the word flashed through your tiny world that the hunters were out, and with the stink of your fear cutting sharp even through your normal reek, you went to ground until they were gone. Now you know who they might have been. The list is long: sweepers for the kiddy shops, organ- leggers looking for easily Implanted young tissue, "sporting" folks hunting prey that could run and think and maybe beg for merey. But there wasn't any mercy back there. Not for anyone.

You survived somehow, Then one day you found a handful of older kids around your hidey-place. They didn't look like the kids you knew. Now you know the difference between malnutri- tion and health, between clean clothes and dirty rags. Back there. you just knew they looked different. And they talked to you and brought you here. They showed you new things and gave you words for them, They taught you numbers, and what the numbers did. They taught you a new thing you liked almost better than anything. You learned it was called friendship. They gave you your first datajack and showed you how to use it. Then you discovered the Deep Resonance and began to learn the channels, the complex forms, the ways of your new- found home-the Matrix:

Playing an otaku means that your character, in all likelihood, spent his earliest years as an abandoned child in an environment of extreme poverty-surviving by begging, theft and scroung- ing, and subject to the predations of some of the worst walking garbage in the Sixth World. Older otaku recognized the poten- tial to become an otaku in your character and rescued him from this life. They gave him food, shelter, education, and a sense of community-the first he ever experienced.

Outside the tribal structure of his otaku community, your character may be significantly socially handicapped, wholly defi- cient in social skills, Of course, mental stability has to rank high in the things otaku look for in new members, or they'd all be crazy as bedbugs after such severe childhood trauma. But you aren't going to find an otaku who comes across like a cute kid from a sitcom, either. Don't expect non-otaku to like your char- acter too much; they're going to think he's weird and they'll probably make tracks to avoid him whenever possible.

At their best, young otaku are often rude and anti-social, even by shadowrunner standards. They are arrogant in anything Involving the Matrix and more than half convinced that nothing outside the Matrix matters a frag unless it affects their personal comfort or security. The well-being of fellow otaku in their own community is important to them. The well-being of other otaku comes next. Personal friends, if they have any, third, and the rest of the world a very distant fourth. These priorities may manifest themselves as Intensely brattish behavior or as cold-blooded ruthlessness without a trace of what the shrinks call "affect." Certainly, otaku can grow into more well-rounded human beings, given friendship. responsibility, even trust, within the shadow code. But no one is likely to enjoy the company of an otaku while he matures.

CYBERADEPT OR TECHNOSHAMAN?

Otaku fall into two broad groups: the cyberadepts and the technoshamans. Both groups exhibit identical abilities, but they hold different views of the Deep Resonance and their own places In the world. Cyberadepts are rationalists, technophiles-perhaps psycho- logically more attuned to the specific workings of programs and the organization of data than other otaku. They view their state as a natural and Inevitable blending of humanity and tech- nology and tend to express their concepts in precise terms, almost formulae. Technoshamans see the Matrix as a living being, which they have learned to blend with spiritually. They are more mystical, more holistic in their descriptions of computer operations and per- formance than other otaku. Many technoshamans maintain that the Deep Resonance proceeds from spirits resident in the Matrix.

If the gamemaster wants to play up these differences in his games, he may apply the following cyberadept and tech- noshaman bonuses:

    Cyberadepts apply a +1 modifier to the effective rating of any complex form they learn. They must create the form before getting this bonus, but it does not affect the size of the form. This bonus reflects the cyberadepts' particular insight into the details of Matrix operations.

    Technoshamans reduce target numbers by 1 when using their channels, This bonus reflects their approach to the Matrix as a gestalt with which they blend.

Players choosing one or the other of these orientations should roleplay their character accordingly.

MYSTERY OF THE OTAKU

Even the otaku don't know why they experience the Deep Resonance. The technoshamans of the Denver Nexus claim that the work of Shiva and the other sysops who maintain the Nexus has somehow created a cyberspace where they, the true children of the Matrix, see deeper into its truths than the old-tech dinosaurs. Some of them believe that true Spirits of the Matrix exist in this environment. Others claim the Deep Resonance is an actual evolutionary step, and that cyberadepts are the next step in the long march from the first hominids.

Among non-otaku. even wilder theories abound. Some older elves agree with the technoshamans that a Great Spirit has learned to manifest in the Matrix, native to the Matrix the way other nature spirits are native to their domains. A very experi- enced decker in Seattle advanced the theory, before he disap- peared, that the Virus of 2029 had evolved Into a cybernetic life- form, as homo sapiens evolved from the primal goo of Earth's earliest seas, and that it was helping the children of the Matrix evolve into a form similar to its own. A top-secret report to the board of Aztechnology suggests the existence of a super-Al somewhere in cyberspace, which is now functioning indepen- dently and using the otaku as its agents. Hard to say what else the author thought. She committed suicide a few days after sub- mitting the final draft of her report, which her superiors dis- missed as the work of an unbalanced mind. A reporter in Berlin left partial notes suggesting that aliens from outer space were taking up residence in the Matrix and grooming earth children as a conquering army of netsoldiers. His editors considered running the story after the traffic accident. but couldn't find the rest of his files, so they spiked it instead.

Given this track record, other folks with theories about the technoshamans and cyberadepts may be playing it smart by keeping quiet. Regardless of these differing explanations, the experience of the Deep Resonance follows certain patterns. Technoshamans report a sudden transport to a place unlike any in their Matrix or physical experience. Here they encounter a being, or beings. who give them the seed knowledge that grows into their ability in the Matrix. Cyberadepts, on the other hand, claim that they know they are still in the Matrix, but perceive connections and networks of dataflow that transcend the interface of the deck. Both emerge from the experience with the abilities described in this text. Sometimes they enter these states again, and when they return they have gained new abilities or received a mission which they must carry out.

WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

Good question. Those who may know are not saying. Sometimes otaku undertake specific missions, which they claim -come from the Deep Resonance. These missions can be trivial or major. Trivial missions include ensuring the delivery of programs to specific places at specific times, the kind of low-level gigs that secure courier services usually handle. Major missions have Involved preventing certain corporations from achieving specific goals: neutralizing, or killing magicians Involved in certain research or cooking the research files to sabotage the projects: and preventing (or ensuring) certain deaths-either apparent accidents or deliberate assassinations.

Often, otaku on a mission seem devoid of anything a human would recognize as compassion. But in the main, otaku missions turn out to be for the benefit of liberty and of humanity at large. once the patterns become discernible-as if they were dictated by some source that perceives the interplay of seemingly unre- lated, even trivial, events in the world community bound together by the Matrix. The real Ghost in the Machine? Or children playing at deity with powers that their elders cannot control? Despite the information on the otaku that exists, far more remains unknown about these individuals. If some type of guiding force exists behind the otaku, why has it chosen an army of chil- dren with virtually no experience of life outside the Matrix? And why the different experiences of the technoshamans and cyberadepts? What could cause changes in the human neural net that 2 1st-century geneticists cannot understand, let alone replicate? Perhaps future explorers of that strange universe called the Matrix may one day find answers to such questions.

They say Ares is so far behind the SOTA that it's almost not worth decking their boxes. That rotting pile of stuffers must be Info uploaded by the Ares pubflacks, 'cause if you believe that, we've got a great deal on resort homesteads in the Jersey Toxic Zone for you. Ares engineers its systems for maximum dataflow overview. Transaction packets and data streams transmitted between individual hosts in a local net must pass through heav- ily loaded chokepoints. The working mainframes themselves are relatively IC-free, which promotes maximum efficiency, while the chokepoints provide the focal point for Ares data security.

The Regional Sales complex shown here is a tiered system that opens onto the public grid through Host A, an open-access Green system where Ares displays promotional sims and non- classified product data files to clients. Hidden behind the salesroom is the chokepoint labeled Host B. This guards the more sensitive systems but doesn't carry any paydata itself. Host B is the hub for Hosts CI through C4: Accounting. Tech Support, Sales Management and Maintenance, respectively. Both CI and C2 provide gateways to the area-PLTG backbone. Hosts C1 through C3 provide some useful paydata. C4, the Maintenance area, includes most of the slave nodes a team would need on a ground insertion into the office building. The real hot stuff-exec data files, secure e-mail and the security slave nodes-take up space on Host D, networked to C4. Other valuable Ares hosts may be located and accessed through the PLTG.

	Paydata: 0

	Host A is designed as a standard office/salesroom metaphor mixed with UMS iconography, so pedestrian it does- n't count as sculpture. Any reality filter will automatically domi- nate Host A. Deckers searching for paydata find only some entertaining sims (the military hardware ones are terrific) and catalog entries for Ares products of all kinds. Viewing sales files and promos does not require an opera- tion or affect the security tally. Any decker with a credstick to slot, drawing on a legit account or a certified balance, can order any Ares product through this host, just like a customer who logged on legally. Getting an order accepted without paying would require a run into Host CI to insert a false payment record into the Accounting database. The Access subsystem contains a dedicated port to Host B. A successful Analyze Access operation will reveal the address.

That is, If a decker chalks up 5 points getting through Host B to Host CI, then accumulates 2 more points per- forming a Logon to Host operation to return to B from CI. the Security Tally on B now totals 7. Passive IC programs triggered on Host B, Including Trace, do not run while the decker is on another host, but resume where they left off as soon as he logs back on to Host B. Active IC programs will follow the decker from Host B if he logs on to any other host In the network!

	The C systems all have identical software, including the IC, but the sculpture on each one is different. Passive IC on a C host, including Trace, will shut down when a decker logs off that host. Active IC will pursue the decker to another part of the C network and onto Host B. Security tallies remain in effect on any C host. For example, if a decker accumulates a Security Tally of 4 on CI, logs back onto Host B, and later in the same run logs back onto CI, his tally picks up at 4.

	The sculpture on CI is standard office decor at first blush, but the helpful secretarial icons are all tuned up to cutting-edge, male fashion model dress and good looks. The supervisory programs are all female. It's heavily seated sculpture, subtle but solld. A decker would be well advised to load a top-line, fem-exec look if he decides to "dress" his MPCP for a run into this system. The CI metaphor dates from when Regina O'Meara edged out Ted Harcourt as the local head of accounting. Harcourt had mandated pornsim queens as the main iconography for the serv- er programs when he was in charge. Modesty prevents us from describing the way they'd acknowledge a successful access, but some deckers used to log-on and open absolutely worthless files just for the experience.

	The metaphor on C2 is an old-style amusement park, The roller coaster is the Index access to all the low-security files. Deckers swoop and scream until they reach the right datastore. then the car JUMPS off the tracks and salls through the air Into the file area. The high-security spec files follow a fun-house motif.

	The gateways to the PLTG are in the Access subsystems on both CI and C2. Scramble IC protects both SANs. so a decker needs to perform a successful Decrypt operation in order to log- on to the PLTG.

	C3 uses a standard office motif, though it does count as a sculpted system, Techno-flash control panels showing readouts on the build- ing environmentals, the elevators and plumbing fill C4-every- thing's here except security sensors and alarms, which are resi- dent on Host D. The client servers use well-sculpted custom iconography consisting of shiny robots with goofy smiles pasted on their faces. The rest is mostly UMS iconography. The trap door to Host D rotates randomly through all the subsystems nanosec- ond by nanosecond, and so a decker must search for it every time he needs to find it.

SHISEKI-GUMO

They used to say "crime doesn't pay." Whether or not that was ever true, it sure ain't true in the 2 1 st century. It pays so well even crooks need bookkeeping computers and grid access to keep track of things, The Shiseki-gumo, a mid-level yakuza syn- dicate in the Seattle area, Is no exception, Their operations include smuggling black tech between North America and Asia, industrial espionage, and providing secure communications for low-budget shadowrunners, fumbling white-collar criminals, and other naive souls who don't realize that the secret you pass on someone else's network today is the stuff that gets you black- mailed tomorrow.

The syndicate keeps its working host stashed behind a cover operation down on the waterfront by the name of Tri-Marine Imports. The Tri-Marine host looks like any other small business system until a decker makes it mad. That triggers a bouncer from Green to Red and drops IC all over the place. When the bouncer kicks in, the Tri-Marine machine also switches from UMS to a sculptured system.

Because it constantly switches periods, decker's find it almost impossible to preset their MPCP iconography to fit the metaphor. It is worth noting that the yak possess a fierce reputation for investigating, pursuing, and terminating anyone who decks their systems, any accomplices or associates of those deckers, and anyone who buys hot data stolen from them-all as an example to others. Deckers should know this going in, and if they decide to try their datasteal anyway, should invest in the best camo utilIties and other defensive software available to defeat trace IC.

If a decker has a death wish, he might as well use it construc- tively. Raiding any of the federal offices in Seattle or elsewhere can be very profitable-unless you crack black dataspace and get fried. The diagram above illustrates the typical setup to be found In almost any UCAS office outside of DeeCee (the systems in the capital are much, much nastier), This is a non-secure system, one that connects to the grid. High-security sites like the IRS, FBI and black military systems keep their most secret data on machines that have no grid connection. The systems that need an occa- sional chat with the outside world maintain heavily defended connections to the government PLTG.

It might be the system that SIN-holders on public assistance access to collect benefits, or where a citizen logs on to renew a license, register a com- plaint, or otherwise interact with the feds. These hosts don't offer much improvement on the physical offices used in the pre- Matrix bureaucracies: long walt cycles, the most boring iconog- raphy on the grid, and surly I/O from clerical operators and expert systems. The look and feel of Host A on a standard bureaucratie network Is plain UMS, with a particularly stodgy quality that might as well be part of government requirement specifications, it's so prevalent. Paydata exists here only in big, bulky packages-the almost- public records concerning business transacted on the host that are bound to be somehow valuable to somebody out there .. Slave systems here are pretty trivial, controlling lights, air conditioning and other amenities for the physical office where the local bureaucrats operate.

	Paydata: 6
	Paydata Density: 2D6 x 15

	Host B handles the day-to-day office activities for the site. A welfare office would keep records of recipients, payments, med- ical programs, and so on. A licensing operation would store records of permits issued, citations or violations, and so on. If a decker is looking for specific material, rather than ran- dom paydata, this would be the place to go for private files stored (illegally) by low-level government workers. If the decker wants to riffe confidential (but not particularly secret) files-say, the service record of a particular employee-those records would be on Host B as well. Secure files connected to the oper- ation of the office would be on Host D.

	Host C in this architecture is a chokepoint that controls access between the secure Host D. with its gateway to the government PLTG, and the open systems connected to the public grid. No paydata. useful slave systems, or other benefits on Host C-Just nasty IC, Highly secure government offices usually make Host C Red Instead of Orange, and may be authorized to use deadly force- lethal black IC.

Paydata: 9 (Paydata Density: 2D6 x 15 Mp)

This one's the treasure chest. In addition to the basic pay- data, the type of secure data that shadowrunners typically need in an adventure are stored on Host D. The host also contains the SAN into the Federal PLTG. Files such as crime reports implicating shadowrunners are stored here, but if they have been online more than a few hours, they will also have been distributed to high-security databanks (Red-Hard sys- tems) through the PLTG. Erasing or modifying such records would involve an extremely dangerous run through the government grid,

The Access subsystem is protected by Scramble IC; until the decker decrypts it, his persona cannot log on to the host. All secure datafiles are protected by Scramble IC, data bombs, or worms,

About Government Deckers

The following guidelines for government deckers also apply to corp deckers, or any decker retained to defend a system. The gamemaster may design an NPC decker of his own, but may use the following rules if he needs a quick-and-dirty decker character. Government deckers may be defined as Inferior, Equal, or Superior opponents. An Inferior opponent has an MPCP Rating 2 points below that of the player-character decker. A Superior oppo- nent has an MPCP Rating 2 points higher. An Equal opponent has an MPCP Rating-and everything else-equal to the player-char- acter decker's. Similarly, an Inferior opponent has a Response Increase 1 point lower than the player-character decker's, and a Superior opponent's Response Increase is one point higher.

Persona programs for all government deckers are at their maximum. As a decker's total Persona Ratings cannot exceed 3 x MPCP and four programs make up a standard persona, the rat- ing for each persona program ends up being three-fourths of the MPCP, rounded down. Government and corp deckers running without a Masking program have ratings equal to the MPCP for each persona program. All utilities are at maximum value-equal to the MPCP rat- ing. Inferior opponents should rarely. If ever, have utilities with options. Superior opponents should have programs with a little something special, at the gamemaster's discretion. An Equal opponent's utilities depend on the player-character decker-if the player character is loaded for bear, so is his opponent.

These NPCs usually carry Armor, Attack. Cloak, and Lock- On. They may also carry one or more utilities that attack Persona Ratings, especially if their job includes "softening up" the intrud- er for attacks by IC. Inferior opponents carry no self-repair pro- grams. Superior opponents carry Medic and Restore. Equal opponents match the player-character decker's capabilities.

On systems where deadly force might reasonably be expected, any NPC decker may be armed with black hammer or killjoy. Government deckers are especially likely to carry track programs, as part of their department's job is to enforce Matrix law in the real world as well as on the grid. These deckers use Legitimate icons on the hosts they defend, and so IC will not attack them. To attack these oppo- nents, the intruding decker must use the appropriate target number to hit Legitimate Icons (see Cybercombat, p. 123),

### **Host Design Tables**

To design a typical host, select the desired Security Rating and Intrusion Difficulty, then make the appropriate dice rolls to determine the Security Value and Subsystem Ratings. The Paydata Allocation Table provides formulas for determining Paydata Points and data density of the host, Density may be rolled in advance or when the decker locates the paydata and Is ready to download it.

#### **Host Rating Table**

| Intrusion Difficulty | Security Value | Subsystem Ratings |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Easy | 1D3 + 3 | 1D3 + 7 |
| Average | 1D3 + 6 | 2D3 + 9 |
| Hard | 2D3 + 6 | 1D6 + 12 |

#### **Paydata Allocation Table**

| Security Code | Paydata Points | Data Density |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Blue | 1D6 - 1 | 2D6 × 20 Mp |
| Green | 2D6 - 2 | 2D6 × 15 Mp |
| Orange | 2D6 | 2D6 × 10 Mp |
| Red | 2D6 + 2 | 2D6 × 5 Mp |

#### **Sheaf Design**

Next, design the security sheaf. First, roll 1D6 + 2 and apply the appropriate modifier to produce the first trigger step. Then repeat the dice roll and add the modified result to the first step. The result is the second trigger step. Repeat the process to determine the remaining trigger steps.

#### **Trigger Steps**

| Host Security Code | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Blue | +4 |
| Green | +3 |
| Orange | +2 |
| Red | +1 |

Now determine the events triggered by each trigger step, using the Alert Table. Roll 1D6 for each step and add 1 to the roll result for every trigger step allocated to the current alert level.

#### **Alert Table**

| Modified Roll | No Alert | IC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1-3 | Reactive White | Cripplers\* |

| 8- | Passive Alert | Proactive White |
| Active Alert | Reactive Gray | Proactive Gray |
