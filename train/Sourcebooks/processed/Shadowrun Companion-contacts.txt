# SHADOWLAND

The organization/information service/clearing-house known as **Shadowland** may well be a shadowrunner's most useful "contact". In addition to providing a valuable bulletin-board service and a secure, reliable line into the Matrix, Shadowland is host to the Hacker House (see _Virtual Realities 2.0_) and serves as a link to numerous "private chat rooms" and other specialty boards. Characters must remember, however, that nothing in Shadowland is private. Unlike metahuman contacts, who may agree to keep a secret and then actually keep their word, once a piece of information appears on Shadowland, it instantly becomes available for public access. A character can hide the plans for a revolutionary new laser technology in Shadowland, but anyone else who finds it can take it. Shadowland is strictly an "all or nothing" proposition.

Any character with Computer 1 or higher may select Shadowland as a contact during character creation. Shadowland is a Level 1 contact, and characters may not improve its contact level. The upkeep cost for Shadowland consists of the time and effort required to learn and maintain the elaborate codes, and the Matrix fees shadowrunners must pay to use this service. As part of their upkeep requirements, characters must also periodically post information to the Shadowland boards and to its databases. Any communication in search of information conducted between a character and another individual on Shadowland may be considered a FOF meeting, regardless of form (e-mail, icon-based interaction and so on). When dealing with Shadowland as a contact, the character must do the work needed to find information ; unlike other contacts, getting information from Shadowland is not a simple matter of asking a question, paying some nuyen and getting an answer. Think of Shadowland as a combination dorm room and massive private library—a somewhat messy room filled with personalized icons scattered about in a random fashion. All the really good stuff is there, but characters have to wade through a bunch of really weird stuff to get to it. The person who created each icon determines the appearance of each file—ranging from the frighteningly realistic Dunkelzahn icon that represents his last will and testament to the "standard" default Matrix Icon of a document stolen from Ares. Characters must know the right codes and pass several ID checks in order to gain access to Shadowland and to the desired information.

Like all contacts, Shadowland protects itself with a well-established security screen. Rather than relying on systems created and manufactured by outside sources, however, Shadowland relies on the skills and talents of some of the best living deckers and programmers to manage its security. As a concession to the users' safety, characters are identified only by their street name and decker icons—which do not indicate the location of the character's meat body or the motivation of his data search. Any information search in Shadowland takes 3D6 days to perform from a tortoise deck. This period reflects the time required to go through the millions of datapulses to find what the character is looking for. Gamemasters may reduce or increase the time required depending on the specifics of the search. For example, a search for all available information on Damien Knight might take several days, while compiling all the information available on a tattooed razorpunk by the name of Zaz may require only a few minutes. When each search is completed, Shadowland compiles the requested data in a folder known as a sourcebook. Characters who visit Shadowland directly via the Matrix (rather than by using a tortoise) can initiate and complete a search in 2D6 hours. Shadowland also allows characters to use their own search knowbots, as long as those programs are approved by and registered with the Shadowland deckers and programmers—a process that usually takes less than an hour. Knowbot searches take 2D6 hours. After completing its initial task, a registered knowbot can remain in the Shadowland matrix and feed its controlling character any new information on the selected topic as soon as the information becomes available.

If desired, gamemasters can increase the difficulty of finding specific information in Shadowland by applying an appropriate target number from the Contact Knowledge Table (p. 69) to all Matrix-based tests made to locate data. Gamemasters may also increase the search period for characters using tortoises simply by adding the target number to the number of days required for the search. (This time increase reflects the painstaking effort required to access each and every document potentially related to the topic in question) .

# PLAYING CONTACTS

The preceding rules are designed to make playing contacts as much fun for gamemasters as playing characters is for players. But even these rules, including the example of Billy Boy and his use of contacts and FOFs, only scratch the surface of the possibilities such NPCs represent. Gamemasters can make their contacts fully realized characters by generating biographies and game statistics as complete as those of player characters (using any of the various character-creation systems, including Edges and Flaws where applicable). When contacts and their contacts become more well-rounded people, gamemasters can find multiple uses for these characters: as instructors, Enemies (see p. 71), competitors, dupes, moles, traitors, secret agents, godparents—and any of these roles can provide the starting point for an adventure or a campaign.

As a twist on the usual role of contacts in a game, some contacts may seek out the player characters in search of information (game mechanics for these occurrences are provided in Favor for a Friend, below). In some circumstances, contacts may compete with player characters to obtain data or resources, a situation that can quickly develop into bidding and information wars as contacts play the characters off other NPCs or manipulate events to their own advantage. Other contacts may be pressured by outside individuals, groups, or other mysterious forces to not cooperate with player characters or even mislead them. Contacts also may be less than cooperative for their own reasons (game mechanics for such circumstances appear in Spilling the Beans, p. 69). Still other contacts can serve as ordinary "men on the street"—sources of rumors, misinformation, and apparently useless information. A casual contact who tells the runners what they want to know and then goes on to chat about recent weird happenings, an obscure news item, a disturbing, recurring dream, a problem his wife is having at work, or a general decline in the quality of the soyshakes at his local Stuffer Shack provides an excellent method of introducing clues about future events into the campaign world without restricting the player characters' desire to control their own destinies.

Finally, by providing contacts with specialized knowledge, secret histories, unexpected acquaintances, or avenues of information that player characters might never suspect, gamemasters can make contacts surprisingly multi-dimensional or disappointingly narrow in their knowledge, according to the demands of his game. Asking a talismonger to obtain a gun may be a useless request, but asking your Thursday-afternoon chess partner at the local soykaf shop for the home address of a high-ranking Knight Errant official might lead to a big and unexpected payoff. (Game mechanics for such circumstances appear in Contact Knowledge, p. 69) .

### FAVOR FOR A FRIEND

Nearly every **Shadowrun** novel and most of the published adventures contain at least one instance in which someone asks a runner to perform a "favor for a friend". The favor-for-a-friend job transcends the usual "work for nuyen" shadowruns and allows gamemasters to inject unexpected plot twists or introduce new levels of conflict into their campaigns. Favors requested by contacts also allow player characters to choose their own runs, rather than passively waiting for the next Mr. Johnson to come along and offer them a job. Pursuing a shadowrun as a favor to a contact or friend allows runners to explore personal interests and, more importantly, allows characters to take on opponents and obstacles with the confidence that the job is not planned as a setup—though it may well become a trap somewhere along the way. Gamemasters also can tie favor requests to the Markers system for Karma (see Karma, p. 76).

### CONTACT KNOWLEDGE TABLE

| Target Requested Information | Target | Modifiers | Sample Question |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| General information | 2 | Special Circumstance | "Hey, did you hear that the Big D died?"  |
| More details | 4 | -2 The field in question is the contact's specialty | "What are your sources saying about Dunkelzahn's physical remains?"  |
| Even more details | 6 | -3 The contact is a fixer or a Mr. Johnson | "Sheesh! I asked one lousy yak one lousy question about the security on Inauguration night and she couldn't run out on me fast enough. What's the connection?"  |
| Specific names, places and really cool things | 8-11 | | "Nadja Daviar can't be as squeaky clean as she looks. Get me the name of her personal shopper and I'll show you the dirt behind her ears."  |
| Info not yet on the streets | 12-13 | | "Project Ragnarok' obviously means something to somebody. Will you be the lucky recipient of my certified credstick, or should I go to one of my other contacts?"  |
| Info beyond the realm of the streets | 14+ | | "What does the phrase 'techno-magical elf cabal' bring to mind in reference to our late, lamented president?"  |

In general, as a contact becomes more valuable and helpful, he is more likely to ask the player character to do him a favor in return for providing information at some point. Naturally, the more useful the contact, the more dangerous and troublesome that favor should be.

### CONTACT KNOWLEDGE
The result of a player character's Etiquette Test indicates how successful she was in persuading a contact to reveal information. A failed Etiquette Test simply means that the character hasn't convinced the contact to share information—the Etiquette Test does not indicate what the contact actually knows. To determine what a contact knows, the gamemaster should make an Etiquette or Intelligence Test for the contact (use whichever skill is most appropriate to the situation). Set the test target number based on the type of information the player character wants from the contact and the information's apparent value, as shown on the Contact Knowledge Table. The contact or FOF level of the contact does not affect the target number. Generally, a single success on the test means the contact knows the requested information (as well as the information for lower target numbers). If the information requested covers a particularly broad spectrum, the gamemaster can adjust the contact's knowledge higher or lower on a sliding scale based on the number of successes the test generates.

If the Etiquette or Knowledge Test fails, the contact simply does not know the requested information—though he or she may still try to be helpful. For example, a contact who doesn't have the answer the character is looking for may deliberately or inadvertently provide incorrect information for any number of reasons: to stay on the character's good side by telling him something, to throw the character off the track, because he believes that his information is true, as a favor to one of his friends, to save his skin from his own enemies—the list of reasons goes on forever.

Our friend Billy Boy has dropped in at Droogies to see if Joe the bartender knows what's up with a certain megacorp named Renraku. Billy specifically wants to find out where Renraku is testing its latest cyberdeck prototype and who's in charge of those trials. The gamemaster decides that this information qualifies as fairly sensitive, and so he decides that Joe will know only part of what's being said on the streets. He then makes an Etiquette (Street) Test against a Target Number 8 to determine Joe's level of knowledge regarding the new deck. The test generates no successes. Consequently, the only news Joe has heard is that Renraku recently beefed up security at a few of its local warehouses.

### SPILLING THE BEANS
As stated earlier, what a contact knows and what he or she is willing to tell are two very different things. In most **Shadowrun** games, gamemasters and players assume that contacts will reveal any information they know without argument. This section offers rules that more realistically reflect the facts of life: even contacts have good days and bad days, personal crises and expensive habits to support, and on any given day they may give away their secrets for free or decide to keep their information to themselves—or even worse, to sell it to the highest bidder.

The simplest way to simulate this interaction between character and contact is to modify the target number for the standard Etiquette Test that a character makes to obtain information from a contact. Under the standard **Shadowrun** rules, the default target number for this test is 4. This number can change, depending on the subject of the character's question. For example, a metahuman-rights activist contact may be quite ready to spill the beans on the local Humanis chapter, but the same contact might be quite reluctant to answer questions about the local Mob boss, especially if the mafioso is particularly powerful in the shadows or if the contact has some sort of professional or personal relationship with the Mafia. In this case, getting information about the HP from Mongo the metahuman-rights activist may require only a successful Etiquette (4) Test. Retrieving any information regarding the local Mob from Mongo the Mafia soldier might require a successful Etiquette (12) Test—a much more difficult task, even though the character is asking the same contact both questions.

When making the Etiquette Test to determine the contact's willingness to talk, the gamemaster can also use the number of successes from the test to determine how much information the contact reveals. The greater the number of successes, the more the contact tells. (This is the system used in all published **Shadowrun** adventures) .

Alternatively, gamemasters can make all Etiquette and Negotiation Tests opposed tests. In this case, the player character makes his test per standard rules. The gamemaster makes the opposed test for the contact, applying any appropriate target modifiers from the Contact Opposed Test Table (p. 71). The target number for the contact tests is the Charisma of the player character. Subtract the total number of successes generated by the contact's Etiquette or Negotiation Test from the total successes generated on the player character's Etiquette Test. The result determines how much information the contact reveals: the greater the number of successes, the more the contact tells. If the contact's test generates more successes than the player character's test, the gamemaster may decide that the contact simply refuses to tell the character much of anything, or the contact might spin tall tales or give misleading information. Note that the modifiers in the Contact Opposed Test Table can be used for opposed tests made during bargaining, interrogation, or any other negotiation situation.

Billy Boy still wants that information about Renraku, so he visits Timmons the cop. First, the gamemaster makes an Etiquette Test for Timmons to determine if the cop knows anything about the new Renraku deck prototype. The gamemaster sets the Target Number at 8 (Renraku would understandably keep security tight around the project). The test generates 2 successes, and so the gamemaster decides that Timmons knows who's running the prototype testing, and where the testing lab is located. (If pressed, the gamemaster will explain that Timmons knows this info because Renraku hired Lone Star to provide some extra patrols around the lab site and to control after-hours access to it) . Next, Billy Boy makes the standard Etiquette Test to get Timmons talking. The information is sensitive, so the gamemaster sets the Target Number at 8. Billy receives an extra die on the test, because Timmons is a Level 2 contact, but Billy's test still only generates 2 successes. Next, the gamemaster makes an opposed test for Timmons to determine what he tells Billy. The base target number for the Etiquette (Street) Test equals Billy's Charisma Rating of 4. A +1 target modifier applies because Timmons is a Level 2 contact to Billy, but the information is also potentially harmful to the "target" (in this case, Renraku), so a -2 target modifier applies as well. That produces a final Target Number 3. The test for Timmons generates 4 successes, which negate Billy Boy's 2 successes. Consequently, Timmons tells Billy to stay away from Renraku. He says he can't believe that Billy would even think about asking Timmons to jeopardize his job by revealing such information. In the end, Billy Boy doesn't get the information he wanted—but he realizes that Timmons is too scared to talk and deduces that Lone Star is somehow involved in the security around the new cyberdeck project.

# ENEMIES
All shadowrunners make enemies during the course of their careers. It goes with the territory. Shadowrunners who are doing their jobs are bound to make someone angry at some point. They lie, steal, own more weapons than small armies (and probably killed someone to get them) and regularly foil the plans of evil megacorporate execs, Mob bosses, and other assorted heavy hitters. The following Enemies rules reflect this fact of the shadowrunning life.

### CREATING ENEMIES
Gamemasters may create personal Enemies for all player characters during the character creation process. Enemies may be individuals or organizations, ranging from spurned lovers to disgruntled contacts to the buddies of a dead partner to paramilitary groups and even whole megacorps. Personal Enemies can become team Enemies and vice versa. And if a character's life proceeds along normal lines for a shadowrunner, he or she will continue to collect Enemies like trophies throughout his or her career. Every time a character or team makes a big score, destroys property, steals a researcher's life's work, extracts a wageslave, or performs some other action that results in collateral damage to life and livelihood, their name appears on someone's drek list—and what they did will come back to haunt them if their target has the opportunity, power, contacts, or resources to make them pay for what they did. In short, the very nature of a shadowrunner's existence guarantees that the character will always have an Enemy or two or three plotting against him or her, ever alert for the chance to get a little payback.

To create an Enemy or Enemies for a player character, the gamemaster first determines the character's Enemy Rating, according to the Enemy Rating Table. The more powerful and influential a character is, the more trouble he will attract, and so a character's resources provide a convenient basis for the Enemy Rating. Characters with low Resources will have Enemies designed using a relatively low Enemy Rating ; characters with high Resources will have Enemies designed using a relatively high Enemy Rating. The Enemies You Deserve table suggests rough guidelines for the type of Enemy each Enemy Rating represents. Gamemasters can allocate an Enemy's Rating as they see fit. For example, a gamemaster can give a character with Resource Priority A a single Enemy at an Enemy Rating of 4, two Enemies each at Enemy Rating 2, four Enemies each at Enemy Rating 1, one Rating 3 Enemy and one Rating 1 Enemy, and so on. Remember that certain character Flaws increase the number of or ratings for a character's Enemies (see Edges and Flaws, p. 21). Though the Enemy Rating Table includes Ratings 5 and 6 Enemies, these types of opponents are probably best reserved for over-the-top supervillain games. A high-Rating Enemy's efforts to catch or kill a character can easily become the major theme of a campaign—and such campaigns can quickly become tiresome for other players if the gamemaster cannot find a way to keep their characters involved in the game. In most cases, no single character should start a game with a Rating 5 or 6 Enemy, though the Hunted Flaw (see p. 33) might justify such a circumstance.

| **ENEMY RATING TABLE** | **Standard System** | **Point-Based System** |

| **THE ENEMIES YOU DESERVE** | **What It Means** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Enemy Rating** | |
| 0 | You're such a good boy. Your mother would be proud. |
| 1 | You showed up that ganger in front of his chica. |
| 2 | You butted heads with his friends, too. |
| 3 | Uh-oh—those gangers just got some new toys from their corp buddies. |
| 4 | How flattering—your chummers at Aztechnology have hired some bounty hunters to deal with you. |
| 5 | The boys at Fuchi want their wiz new cyberheart back—and they're not planning to sew you up after they rip it out of your chest. |
| 6 | You're dating whose son? Are you aware he was the head of magic-based biowarfare for that corporation you hit last week—you know, the wageslave whose life you ruined?  |

### ENEMY CHARACTERISTICS
Every Enemy is defined by three characteristics: Power, Motivation, and Knowledge. As shown in the Enemy Rating Table, the Enemy Rating determines how many total Characteristic Points the gamemaster may assign to the characteristics. The gamemaster assigns each characteristic a Rating of 0-6, basing the number of points on the type of Enemy being created, the demands of the campaign, the character's actions, and the complexity of the gamemaster's (and/or player's) plan for the player character's ultimate fate. (The Characteristic Points can also be thought of as "drek points," because they represent how much drek the Enemy can throw at the character) . Depending on how the gamemaster weights the Enemy characteristics, that Enemy may be a persistent annoyance or a constant threat, or every attack may seem arbitrary—the character simply doesn't see a connection, and trouble from the Enemy always comes as a complete surprise. An Enemy makes an ideal plot device for sending off a character with the Borrowed Time Flaw (p. 25) in a blaze of glory (and helping out the team in the process).

* **Power**: An Enemy's Power rating indicates the resources the Enemy can use to harass the character. For example, an Enemy with a low Power Rating (1 to 2 points), such as a corporate secretary, can't perform a hit herself. To harass a character, a corporate secretary will have to come up with a low-tech, easy way to hurt a character—like tipping off the cops. An Enemy with a moderate Power Rating (3 to 4 points) might be able to geek the character himself, or he'll have the resources to hire assassins to do the job. An Enemy with a high Power Rating (5 to 6 points) can mess with a character any way she pleases. She can send an initiatory group full of physad killers after the character, sabotage his contacts, buy off his closest friends, or slowly destroy everything he's ever held dear. An Enemy with a Power level of 0 has little means to hurt a character. However, such Enemies can spread nasty rumors very effectively and bide their time.
* **Motivation**: An Enemy's Motivation Rating indicates how badly the Enemy wants to hurt the character. An Enemy with low Motivation (1 to 2 points) might simply want to "teach that punk a lesson" and will settle for smacking the character around or stealing his possessions. An Enemy with moderate Motivation (3 to 4 points) will want to beat the character to within a centimeter of his life or "do back what he did to me". An Enemy with high Motivation (5 to 6 points) will continent-hop and go into low-Earth orbit to track down the character and exact revenge. An Enemy with Motivation 0 may wait for the character to fall into her lap—which can be arranged, with cruel gamemaster plotting.
* **Knowledge**: An Enemy's Knowledge Rating indicates how much the Enemy knows about the character's whereabouts. An Enemy with low Knowledge (1 to 2 points) has no idea of the character's location. If the character's face appears on a KSAF broadcast, the Enemy might see it and figure out where the character was a month ago. An Enemy with moderate Knowledge (3 to 4 points) knows which city the character calls home, but must wait for the character to make the first move in order to pinpoint his or her current location. An Enemy with high Knowledge (5 points) might have round-the-clock surveillance on the character, or be an intimate, trusted friend turned sour. An Enemy with Knowledge Rating 6 knows exactly where the character is as play begins. An Enemy with Knowledge 0 has feelers out trying to locate the character but the trail is ice cold.

When Kelly created her decker character, St. Jude, she decided that Jude was raised to believe in God and the sanctity of the family, and that her father, a moderately successful businessman, was always right. When he informed his daughter that she was to marry an elderly, ailing rival businessman, Jude's faith in her father's judgment was completely destroyed. Trained as an information specialist (business jargon for "decker") Jude found it easy to steal proprietary data from both her father's and her fiancé's businesses. She then sold that data, bought herself a cyberdeck, and took off for Denver. The gamemaster decides that Jude has 3 Enemies—her ex-fiancé, her father, and the head of her father's security team, whom she used to get to the information and then hung out to dry. Kelly set Jude's Resources Priority Level at A during character creation, so that means Jude has an Enemy Rating of 4. The gamemaster divides the Enemy Rating as follows:

* **Father**
    * Rating 1
    * Power: 0
    * Motivation: 3
    * Knowledge: 1
    * Daddy is moderately angry with Jude. He has a rough idea where she might have run, but lacks the power to find her or bring her back.
* **Ex-Fiancé**
    * Rating 1
    * Power: 1
    * Motivation: 3
    * Knowledge: 0
    * Jude's ex-fiancé is moderately miffed at her sudden departure. He has the power and resources to do something about being dumped and ripped off, but doesn't know where to start looking.
* **Security Head**
    * Rating 2
    * Power: 1
    * Motivation: 4
    * Knowledge: 1
    * The security head is really angry at Jude—she made him look like a fool and tarnished his reputation. He has the power to track her down, and he has a rough idea of where she is.

Jude's troubles really begin if her Enemies decide to cooperate—and in this situation, they might easily do just that.

### USING ENEMIES
Once the gamemaster establishes an Enemy for a character, that Enemy can become more and less influential throughout the course of the campaign. The Enemy's initial rating may increase or decrease depending on the character's actions, the campaign's story line, events elsewhere in the universe—or, to be honest, gamemaster whim. Used judiciously, an Enemy can spice up a campaign, derail a carefully laid plan, launch a shadowrun, add a much-needed or disastrously ill-timed complication (depending on your point of view), or even distract a character by not showing up when expected. Gamemasters choose when, how, and why an Enemy surfaces and may raise or lower the Enemy's ratings and Characteristic Points according to the current threat the Enemy poses. The gamemaster can also simply adjust the Enemy's actions to suit the story's needs, without crunching the numbers. Managing multiple Enemies for multiple characters can become tricky, but if gamemasters can find a way to successfully track all the Enemies of a shadowrunning team, the rewards in roleplaying and storytelling will make the effort worthwhile. From adding a touch of gritty realism to an adventure to contriving the most fantastic and humorous coincidences, Enemies offer a gamemaster a multitude of useful, enjoyable options in his or her **Shadowrun** game.

As in real life, the potential for mayhem increases exponentially when Enemies join forces against a character or team. Though the partnership may fall apart before the Enemies accomplish their shared goal, together they represent a greater threat than any Enemy individually. Combining the Enemy Ratings of multiple Enemies would quickly send their threat level off the charts, and so gamemasters should simply create an operation of appropriate size and menace to let the player characters know that the drek they're standing in has reached new heights.

Circumstances force Jude to make a run into New Orleans, her hometown. While she's there, she's spotted by a friend of the family who informs her father. The gamemaster decides that her father, a Rating 1 Enemy, instantly becomes a Rating 2 Enemy with appropriate increases to his Motivation, Power, and Knowledge Ratings. Similarly, the security head's rating increases to Rating 3. Jude's appearance really rankles her ex-fiancé, however, whose rating jumps to Rating 3. Jude quickly completes her business in New Orleans and escapes to Seattle before any of her Enemies catch up with her. Her father quickly loses interest in punishing his daughter and soon becomes a Rating 0 Enemy. Other business demands the attention of her ex-fiancé, who reverts to a Rating 1 Enemy. However, the security head picks up her trail while she's in town and grows determined to catch her. He remains a Rating 3 Enemy and follows her to Seattle.

### Why an Enemy May Want to Kill Your Character
The following list represents only a fraction of the innumerable reasons an Enemy may have it in for a character. People turn into Enemies for both more and less serious reasons than these, and each of the reasons provided here has many variations. Be creative—imagine the player character's surprise when he discovers that the mysterious force that has been messing with his cred rating for the past two years and causing him no end of headaches and embarrassment is none other than his former accountant, whom the character only left because his sister married a CPA.

* You left her for dead, or something close to it.
* You ruined his career/business/art, and he has nothing left to lose by hunting you down.
* You burned/blackmailed/double-crossed/set her up—was it for your profit or for her own good?.
* You're a (INSERT CHARACTER'S METATYPE/ETHNICITY/POLITICAL AFFILIATION/RELIGION HERE), and he's gonna put you in your place.
* She's been competing with you since childhood. Now it's serious.
* His job or sense of honor requires him to hunt you down.
* You and she used to be friends, teammates, or lovers. She never forgave you when you left.
* He's just plain mean and petty, and you're a convenient target.
* Stuff as dangerous as what you've gotten hold of can't be allowed to fall into the wrong hands.
* For some reason he thinks you're the baddest mage/samurai/decker/detective on the streets, and he has to knock you off to prove that he's the best.
* You killed someone she cared about—a friend, spouse, lover, teacher, or relative—or someone who was useful to them, such as a researcher, informant, or contact.
* They want to "make an example" of you.
* They hate what you represent—your cause, your person, whatever.
* You exposed his underhanded dealings to his superiors—or maybe to the law.
* You have something she needs for career advancement.
* You ruined or delayed their master plan with your deliberate or unknowing actions.
* You're on opposite sides of the law—but now it's getting personal.
* She's jealous of what you can do or the way you live.
* You know that nifty deck/cyberarm/focus you got last month? It once belonged to him or someone he cared about.
* You just uncovered their conspiracy, and they have to silence you.
* She just doesn't like shadowrunners.

### DEATH AT THE ENEMY'S HAND
The primary purpose of Enemies in a **Shadowrun** campaign is to keep the characters on their toes—and nothing keeps a person on his toes more effectively than the constant threat of imminent death. At times, Enemies may devote all their time, energy, and resources toward getting rid of a character or team or, depending on the other distractions occupying their attention, Enemies may limit their efforts toward eliminating a character or team to passive surveillance. Regardless of the Enemy's current level of interest in a character or team, the gamemaster can always find ways to remind the character or team that the Enemy still exists, still knows where they are, and still intends to take care of them as soon as it's convenient. An Enemy is always a threat, even if the character or team is not his or her current target.

After all the build-up of an Enemy hunting down a character or team throughout a series of adventures or campaigns, with each event bringing the character or team a little closer to death, if the Enemy is going to succeed in his goal the final denouement must be dramatic and meaningful. If the gamemaster's group enjoys a realistic style of play, the Enemy may kill the character in cold blood and the player may not object to this harsh ending to his character's life. If, however, players are particularly attached to their characters—as well they might be, considering the amount of time and effort required to create and maintain them—the gamemaster should design a big death scene that will satisfy everyone's sense of fair play and serve as a major event in the campaign. A character's death should mean something: his sacrifice could keep the team alive ; his death might provide the necessary breakthrough in a case to bring down the bad guy ; her heroic action may change the course of someone else's life, and if the character lingers long enough, she might be able to die with the satisfaction of knowing her death accomplished some good ; the character might die in the process of killing the Enemy (a classic climax to a story)—the possibilities are limited only by the gamemaster's imagination.

### Miraculous Escapes
Often, gamemasters and players may be reluctant to let a character die. The player may have spent a lot of time developing the character, the character may play a key role in the gamemaster's campaign plans, the group may simply like the character too much—there are many reasons why a character should escape death. In these cases, gamemasters can arrange circumstances that foil the Enemy's efforts to kill the character. Anyone who's read comic books or seen action films will already know a handful of ways to keep a character alive in the face of obviously superior Enemies and daunting odds. For example, characters may survive explosions by sheltering behind or in a convenient vehicle/steel crate/pile of building materials/vault ; escape from a sniper by being nursed back to health by a kindly stranger ; overcome grievous Injury through cyber- or bioware replacements ; suddenly manifest magical ability under pressure and walk away from an attack completely unscathed (physically, at least) ; and so on.

Alternatively, the gamemaster can decide that a character's Enemies have some fate other than death in store for the character. The following list provides reasons why an Enemy might not kill a character when he or she really should.

* They aren't in it for revenge, they want the money they lost. Placate them.
* They don't want you dead—they want you to suffer.
* They don't want you dead yet—they want you to suffer first.

### KILLING ENEMIES
Killing an Enemy should be a cathartic and momentous event—a climax of biblical proportions. The death of an Enemy should have as much impact in the game as the death of a character, and can happen for as many different reasons. An Enemy might also survive a team's efforts to kill him or her for the same reasons that a character escapes death.

Killing an Enemy, however, does not guarantee that he or she is gone from a character's life. Player characters may learn the hard way that there's more to living a carefree existence than geeking all their Enemies. Usually, attempts to kill bad guys simply make them madder. **Shadowrun** gamemasters can use a wide variety of explanations to justify why an Enemy keeps coming back, even after the team thought he or she was dead. Begin with the ever-popular, "Did you see/find the body?" and move on to escapes based on magic, cyberware, or a combination of any number of devices to explain the Enemy's continued existence. If it serves the story for a character or team to actually succeed in killing their Enemy, the conflict rarely ends there. Enemies are people too, and they will have friends, relatives, co-workers, hive-mates, mentors, protégés, contacts, bodyguards, employers, and any number of other interested parties willing and able to avenge their deaths—and to step into their shoes as a new, improved, unknown Enemy.

The Advanced Rules section provides new ways to look at existing rules. These rules expand and modify the uses of Karma, offer suggestions for returning wonder and mystery to the use of magic, provide guidelines for designing appropriate opposition for player characters, suggest rules for maintaining the state-of-the-art in technology and magic, propose a variety of ways for characters to retire, and offer several miscellaneous rules that tweak specific areas of the current rules system.

# KARMA
The **Shadowrun** game mechanic of Karma represents a character's accumulated experience and actions. By investing time and energy into certain aspects of his or her personal development or by performing good deeds, a character can earn Karma Points—a sort of cosmic "brownie points". In turn, these Karma Points improve the character's abilities and options. (See pp. 190-91, SRII, for further information) .

### AWARDING KARMA: A CLARIFICATION
In SRII, players are instructed to distribute their characters' Karma using the following guidelines: "Of the Karma a character gets, 90 percent of it becomes Good Karma, which is used over the long term for improving the character. Ten percent goes into the character's Karma Pool for short-term butt-saving. A character's Good Karma and Karma Pool are tracked separately. Always round off in favor of Good Karma". In simpler terms, a character who receives 10 points of Good Karma adds the next Good Karma Point he earns to his Karma Pool. Then the cycle begins again. The next 10 points go to Good Karma, followed by a point to his Karma Pool, and so on.

### BALANCING KARMA AND NUYEN
Most experienced **Shadowrun** gamemasters have faced the problem of balancing the amount of Karma and nuyen that player characters earn during a campaign. The problem of too much or too little nuyen or Karma arises because different player characters may have radically different needs. On one hand, characters reliant on technology need nuyen to maintain their cyberdecks and implants and to buy all the latest tech toys. On the other hand, using magic generally requires large amounts of Karma, and characters who use magic often become "Karma vacuums," never having enough Karma to accomplish what they want to do. A few characters hover in the middle, requiring both Karma and nuyen to remain effective in their role on the team. Consequently, the gamemaster must carefully dispense cash and Karma so that players have enough for their needs but not enough to unbalance the campaign. Though gamemasters can easily take excess money away from characters, keeping Karma under control can be a bit trickier. The Karma-for-Cash and Cash-for-Karma exchanges provide options for managing Karma assets.

* **Karma for Cash**: Under the Karma-for-Cash exchange rule, the gamemaster provides opportunities for player characters to cash in Good Karma Points for nuyen or equivalent resources. Such opportunities represent "lucky breaks" that come a character's way—someone paying off an old favor, a sudden windfall, an easy score, winning the lottery, and so on. Gamemasters should determine the amount of money/resources a character receives in exchange for Karma based on the average levels of nuyen characters possess in the campaign. For example, characters in a relatively down-scale campaign might receive 100 nuyen for each Good Karma Point they cash in. In a more upscale campaign, a single Good Karma Point might be worth 1,000 nuyen. For random, infrequent windfalls, gamemasters can roll dice to determine how much money a character receives. For example, a gamemaster might determine the amount of a windfall by rolling 2D6 and multiplying the result by 10. In any case, Karma Points that are cashed in for nuyen or other assets are permanently gone, in the same way as if the character had spent the points to buy a new skill. Additionally, individual gamemasters should set their own limits on how frequently characters can cash in Karma and how much Karma they can exchange at any one time. Because the workings of Luck and Fate are unpredictable and mysterious, feel free to alter these limits throughout the course of the campaign, or set new limits for each exchange.
* **Cash for Karma**: In the Cash-for-Karma option, a character may exchange nuyen for Karma Points. Such exchanges may represent a character giving money to a church or charity, gambling it away in honor of Lady Luck (perfect for a Coyote shaman), spending it on a "magical lifestyle" that enables the character to perform daily devotions and rituals to boost her Karma, and so on. Individual gamemasters should determine the "nuyen cost" of Karma Points in their campaigns. Low nuyen costs will enable characters to more easily purchase Karma and may encourage player characters to take up magic. Higher nuyen costs will have the opposite effect. Regardless of the temptation, players should avoid bankrupting their characters just to gain a couple of extra Karma Points. Having a lot of Karma does a character very little good when she can't pay her rent!.

### KARMA AND THE AMORAL CAMPAIGN
As a race, we humans like to believe that the cosmos rewards constructive and productive actions more readily than greedy or destructive ones. As is clearly indicated in the rules for Karma and the Karma awards suggested in every published adventure, the **Shadowrun** rules reflect this belief by rewarding characters who do good deeds and punishing those who fail to do the right thing. While history and fiction both provide numerous examples of people who live and act outside the law behaving in a heroic fashion, those same sources prove many times over that being bad can be a whole lot of fun. Rich and powerful people don't worry about the cosmos rewarding them ; they have enough money and influence to create their own luck.

By definition, shadowrunners live outside the law. While that doesn't automatically make them evil, it also doesn't automatically mean that they act like Robin Hood. For every group of shadowrunners looking to make a difference in the world and change things for the better, there is a shadowrunning team willing to do anything for nuyen. Neither approach is the only right choice, because in roleplaying the right choice is the one that lets the group have the most fun. Though the **Shadowrun** rules encourage the heroic attitude, the **Shadowrun** universe seems custom-made for skilled opportunists, both player-characters and NPCs. In those **Shadowrun** games where the player characters (and most NPCs) are amoral, if not downright immoral, gamemasters may use a variation of the Cash-for-Karma exchange system to allow characters to purchase Karma. This arrangement enables characters to obtain Karma Points to use for character improvement and growth without performing good deeds against their nature and inclinations. When using this system, the gamemaster makes no standard Karma awards during the campaign ; player characters must obtain all Karma by purchasing it. The gamemaster sets any limits on the amount of Karma characters can purchase at any one time. The player must first announce his intention to purchase Karma for his character, at which point the gamemaster determines the cost using the following formula: 3D6 x 100 = nuyen cost of 1 Karma Point. Keeping the cost of Karma unpredictable prevents players from keeping a running calculation of how much Karma their character can afford at any given time, thereby more closely matching the basically random system for receiving Karma under the standard rules. Per the standard rules, a character must obtain 10 Good Karma Points before he can gain a Karma Pool Point.

### FAVORS AND MARKERS
Favors and markers offer additional optional uses for Karma in **Shadowrun**. A favor represents the obligation of an NPC to perform a service or action for a player character. A marker represents an obligation of a player character to perform a service or action for an NPC. Favors provide a way for characters to spend Karma Points. Markers let them earn Karma Points. Favors and markers may be negotiated between characters and contacts, friends, neighbors, family, business associates, or any other NPCs with whom the character regularly comes into contact ; favors and markers might just as easily be bargained for with strangers who happen to be in the right place at the right time.

For 1 Good Karma Point, a player character can purchase a favor from an NPC. For the purposes of the favor, the NPC acts like a Level 1 contact (see Contact Levels, p. 62) and maintains a Friendly attitude toward the character for the purpose of Social Skill Tests (p.180, SRII). If desired, gamemasters may give player characters the option to substitute favors for Karma awards at the end of adventures. This practice enables characters to store up a few favors that they can collect on when necessary.

When an NPC (never another player character) calls in a marker, the player character must perform the requested service or action. If the player character performs the requested service, she receives at least 1 Karma Point. Gamemasters may increase the Karma Points earned if performing the service is especially difficult for the character. Only players can agree to markers for their characters, though gamemasters may encourage the use of favors and markers by having NPCs negotiate for markers when dealing with characters ("I'll do this for you and you can owe me one."). Characters can also trade a marker for a future favor from an NPC.

### KARMA POOLS
A character's Karma Pool reflects a character's accumulated "luck". Generally, Karma Pool Points give more experienced characters an advantage over less experienced characters with the same levels of ability, lending support to the maxim, "age and treachery will beat youth and skill every time". The following rules enable gamemasters to expand the use of and more closely control Karma Pools in their games. The gamemaster and all players in a group should agree on any variant Karma Pool uses before incorporating them into their game.

* **Limiting Karma Pools**: In some cases, player characters may amass huge Karma Pools that enable them to escape dangerous situations with little effort. By limiting Karma Pools in their games, gamemasters can force characters to reduce their reliance on Karma Pools to escape harm. Reducing the rate at which characters earn Karma Pool Points is the simplest way to do this. Under the standard rules, characters must earn 10 Good Karma Points before earning a Karma Pool Point (see Awarding Karma: A Clarification, p. 76). Reducing this rate, so that characters must earn 20 Karma Points before they can earn a Karma Pool Point, will keep characters' Karma Pools smaller and make it easier for the gamemaster to maintain game balance. Gamemasters may also use a staggered-rate system for increasing Karma Pools. Under this system, a character earns Karma Pool Points at the standard rate until the Karma Pool reaches 5. From 6 to 10, the character earns 1 Karma Pool Point for every 20 Good Karma Points. When the Karma Pool reaches 10 points, the character then earns 1 Karma Pool Point for every 30 Good Karma Points. The staggered-rate system makes acquiring very high Karma Pools extremely difficult and tends to even the playing field between more and less experienced characters.
* **Split Karma Pools**: Split Karma Pools, or subpools, provide another means of reducing a character's reliance on a single, massive Karma Pool. This option also provides players with additional opportunities to "customize" their characters by creating strengths and weaknesses according to the type of Karma Pools designed and the allocation of Karma Points to each pool, and slows down Karma Pool advancement by forcing players to divide all Karma earned between multiple, potentially exclusive pools. Under standard Karma Pool rules, a player character can use his Karma Pool Points to purchase additional dice for nearly any test. Under the Split Karma Pools system, the character must divide his Karma Pool Points among several subpools, which then may be used to purchase dice only for specific tests. For example, in addition to the usual pools—Control, Hacking, Magic, and Combat—the gamemaster may incorporate the Athletics, Social, and Dodge pools described in Skills and Training, p. 48. Depending on what strengths a player wants to emphasize for his character, he may also designate even more specialized skill pools, such as Negotiation, Electronics, or Biology. If the gamemaster approves, characters may use dice from a subpool to make a test for a related skill. For example, because the Negotiation skill is linked to the Leadership skill on the Skill Web, the character could use the Negotiation Subpool dice to make a Leadership Skill Test. For such default-skill applications of Karma dice, subpool points are worth only half their normal value. Though a Build/Repair Subpool would have little impact on game play, characters such as riggers, deckers and others who rely on such skills to maintain their edge on the streets might find such a pool extremely valuable.
* **Extended Actions**: Gamemasters may also allow player characters to use Karma Pool Points when performing time-consuming actions such as writing Matrix utilities, spell research, enchanting and other activities that require hours, days or even longer periods of time to complete. Under this option, the character must allocate Karma Pool Points to the skill test for the action when the extended activity begins, even if the required skill test comes at the end of the task. In addition, the Karma Pool does not refresh until the action is completed. For example, if a decker character spends 2 Karma Points to add dice to a Computer Skill Test to write a program that requires 3 days to complete, her Karma Pool does not refresh until she has finished writing the program.
* **Permanent Karma Loss**: Finally, gamemasters can limit the size of characters' Karma Pools by increasing the number of Karma Pool uses that result in permanent Karma loss. Under the standard rules, a player character loses any Karma Pool Points he uses to buy test successes (see p. 191, SRII). These points are not replaced when the Karma Pool refreshes—the character must earn new Karma Points to replace them. Similarly, gamemasters can simply declare that other specific uses of Karma result in the loss of Karma Points. The gamemaster and all players should agree on any affected Karma uses before using this option in a game.

### HAND OF GOD
The Hand of God rule allows player characters to spend their entire store of Karma—both Good Karma and Karma Pool Points—in a single instant. The rule is designed for use when a character faces dire circumstances and no single Karma Pool will save his hoop—like when that high-powered sniper rifle goes off and the character is seeing that bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This use of Karma represents divine intervention—the Big Wheel of Fate deciding that the character's time on this planet is not yet up and miraculously pulling him from the very jaws of Death. Gamemasters can explain this phenomena with any rationale they like, from sheer coincidence to the intervention of gods, totems, loa and so on.

To use Hand of God, a character must possess at least 1 Karma Pool Point. When the character burns all her Karma at once to avoid certain death, these points are gone. The character has no Karma until she earns new Karma Points. Understandably, losing all of one's Karma can be a traumatic event for a character. To reflect this, the character must make a Willpower (6) Test. If the test fails, the character receives a mental Flaw, selected by the controlling player. After the player selects the Flaw, the gamemaster selects a mental Edge of equal or lesser value (see Edges and Flaws, p. 21) for the character. The Flaw represents the trauma of the experience, and the Edge represents the strength the character gained from surviving the experience. The character retains the Flaw and Edge for the remainder of her life. A character may use the Hand of God only once.
