In the field, reliability means everything. The Walther PB-120 offers total reliability in a low-profile, easy-to-hide, back-up pistol. Constructed primarily of composite materials, the light but rugged PB-120 works like a charm even in the most hostile environment. A merc couldn't ask for a better piece. In addition to the standard 10-shot clip, Walther also produces a 15-shot, extended clip for emergency situations. Despite its small size, the weapon can mount standard barrel and top-mounted accessories made by most manufacturers.

## COLT COBRA
Everyone who's ever seen tridvids like Fireteam Cherokee knows the Colt Cobra by its distinctive silhouette. It's the best submachine-gun on the market today, and not just on trideo. Bench-test it against any other make or model; none of them can match the Cobra's accuracy or repeatability. Specialweapons units around the globe use the Cobra as their standard SMG: the basic TZ-110 model with its barrel-integrated gas-venting system, the TZ-115 with a built-in laser sight, or the TZ-118 with a built-in smartlink. Do what the world's top guns do: pack a Cobra.

> (Despite what they say about the Warrior-10, I've seen more and more Cobras lately. These days I expect to see it, especially in corp territory.) -Seeker (21:23:48/10-15-54)
> (If you see a particular weapon in the hands of regular corp forces, odds are the corps are using it in bulk.

The Colt M-23 assault rifle can mount standard barrel, under-barrel, and topmounted accessories.

> (Developing-world and quasi-corporate weapon dealers have picked up the M-23 and other weapons in bulk and are selling them in the inner cities at an inflated price. Keep that in mind next time your fixer picks up an assault rifle for you on the cheap.) -Findler-Man (11:32:14/9-30-54)

Comes with integral Smartlink Il circuitry and an under-barrel mini-grenade launcher. The Alpha can accept barrel- and top-mounted accessories, but not under-barrel accessories. It offers the equivalent of 2 points of Recoil Reduction.

> (The Alpha has been making the rounds for a couple of years now, ever since Ares quietly distributed prototypes called the CAR-32 to "selected field-testers" and integrated their feedback into the production model. It seems they ignored one joker's request to integrate an under-barrel combat laser.) -Colonel Cobra (12:05:26/11-15-54)

> (Now we're talking. I was working down in South America (won't say where) not long ago, when I got to use my HVAR. Laid myself down a cover screen so tight I was popping caps as soon as they hopped up. Nasty work, chummers, but I get paid well to do it.) -Whisper (02:30:20/9-26-54)

Treat custom ammo as APDS rounds; the ammo costs 200¥ per box of 10, and has the same Availability and Street Index as the weapon. A player must make separate tests to acquire each box.

> (Grade A+ bang-bang! This one's a frightening piece of work. An "associate" of mine uses the Model 121 extensively. I've backed her up on a couple of jobs; when she's fired at anything further away than a couple of meters, I've heard no gun noise whatso-ever. Scary.) -Hatchetman (03:20:45/10-05-54)
> (You can use the Model 121 right out of the box; I had to use it that way once. I've upgraded mine to use Smartlink Il hardware and fire caseless ammo: no casings, no evidence. The Smartlink's rangefinder makes the long shot a breeze. One drawback, though; the weapon doesn't come apart easily. You have to carry it assembled, and the fraggin' thing is almost as long as I am tall.) -Nightmare (12:19:38/10-08-54)
> (Have you ever seen one of the slugs it fires ?? I use them as paperweights.) -Toad (23:08:25/10-12-54)

> (I got my first Remington scattergun when I was 10. My dad spent days deciding exactly which model to buy for me. He tried them out, asked around, and finally decided on the 900 in matte black. I used it until last year, when I lost it in Aztlan. Ah, well.) -Matador (21:19:23/10-18-54)

Designed to work as a personal weapon or a light or heavy mounted weapon, the HV MPLMG is ideal for area control, especially when belt-fed from an independent source. As with other high-velocity models, the HV MP-LMG comes with an integrated Smartlink Level Il; this top-notch computer interface makes for outstanding performance.

six-round bursts that do 15D damage at a maximum autofire rate of 15 rounds. The weapon comes with an integrated Smartlink II and accepts under-barrel and topmounted accessories.

> (While browsing through a restricted Ares catalog the other day, I noticed that Ares is offering the HV LMG not only as part of its Sentry™ system, but also as a light-vehicle weapon. The example given showed the weapon mounted on the Northrup Yellowjacket PRC-44F. Once they field that puppy, I'm going to be very upset.) -Findler-Man (05:13:59/10-17-54)

> (Back to the HV LMG, I still think that super-machineguns, including bigger miniguns, are next to useless as man-portable weapons. Too much recoil, too little control. As vehicle-mounted or stationary weapons, they work great.) -Pullman Beak (08:20:30/10-22-54)

## M79B1 LIGHT ANTI ARMOR WEAPON
The M79B1 Light Anti-armor Weapon (LAW) is the most common weapon of its type in the world. Designed as a disposable, telescoping container, the single-shot LAW is self-contained and cannot accept accessories. Cheap but reliable, the LAW enables its user to take on almost any armored vehicle! Fired from a shoulder mount, the LAW vents launch gases through the rear of the firing tube, virtually eliminating recoil. A simple, non-adjustable aperture permits excellent sighting under standard environmental conditions.

\*Telescoping container can only be fired when fully opened, reducing Concealability to 0. Firing requires a Complex Action. Use the standard rocket rules for this weapon, p. 99, SRII.

The LAW rocket is not compatible with a standard AVR launcher and does not have armor-piercing capability. A 1 x 10-meter blast zone behind the weapon is subject to 10M exhaust blast, reduced by -1 per meter.

> (The LAW isn't anti-armor if you're talking about tanks. It might punch a small hole in some light tanks, especially security vehicles, but it'll barely scratch anything with real armor.) -Hatchetman (02:20:03/10-12-54)
> (Yeah, but it's only meant to take out light fortifications and lightly armored vehicles. For real anti-tank capability, upgrade to a true AVR or AVM. Course, you'd better have deep pockets.) -Mongoose (05:13:19/10-19-54)
> (Yes, but a half-trained soldier with an AVM can take out a light or medium tank at a cost of less than 5K¥ for the dog. The tank plus training for its crew costs at least a hundred times that much. The AVM's well worth the investment.) Colonel Cobra (12:36:49/10-22-54)

## ARBELAST II MEDIUM ANTI ARMOR WEAPON
A heavier version of the LAW, the Arbelast Il Medium Anti-armor Weapon (MAW) fires a heavier rocket and warhead. Unlike the LAW, the MAW's disposable firing canister does not telescope. The weapon includes a permanent, fixed-magnification system and secondary "pop-up" hard sights.

Use the standard rocket rules for this weapon, p. 99, SRII. This weapon cannot accept accessories. The rocket warhead does 15D Damage, reducing the Power of its blast by -1 for every half-meter, and is subject to Scatter of 2D6 + 2. The MAW rocket is not compatible with a standard AVR launcher and does not have armor piercing capability. A 1 x 12-meter blast zone behind the weapon is subject to 12M exhaust blast, reduced by -1 per meter.

> (Continuing Dog Boy's comment under the LAW entry, if you stand within an MBT's primary anti-personnel zone, you're worm food. Both the LAW and the MAW have a range of 1,500 meters, well outside the APZ. But neither the LAW nor the MAW can penetrate MBT armor, so the point is moot.] -Colonel Cobra (05:12:54/10-26-54)
> (If you have the patience and take the time to aim, LAWs and MAWs work great against low-flying aircraft. You probably won't hit your target, but they don't know that. They see the heat signature and the smoke trail, so they jink away. If they've got cojones they'll take the time to check their displays for locking or tracking first, but most don't.) -Matador (06:13:49/10-29-54)
> (If you're smart, you set up a kill zone where you and another chummer have LAWs and a third has a SAM. You fire and the bird jinks away from you; the other LAW fires and the bird jinks again, right into the path of the SAM. Gotta love it.) -Uncle SAM (08:20:10/10-30-54)

## GREAT DRAGON ATGM
Co-manufactured by Mitsubishi and General Motors Military Division, the Great Dragon ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) is a ground-based spinoff of GM's popular Bandit air-to-ground missiles. Fired from a tripod-mounted, reusable canister, the Great Dragon ATGM has proven an effective battlefield weapon. An integral, semi-smart tracking system keeps the launched missile on target, and delayed main-engine ignition helps hide the launcher's location. These features, combined with a shaped-charge, armor-piercing warhead, enable the Great Dragon to stop enemy armor of any size.

\*See the Weapon Range Table, p. 87.
This weapon uses the standard missile rules, p. 99, SRII. This weapon cannot accept accessories, and includes a fixed Optical Magnification II sighting system. The armor-piercing missile warhead does 20D Damage, reducing the Power of its blast by -5 Blast per meter, and is subject to Scatter of 2D6. A 1 x 12-meter blast zone behind the weapon is subject to 12M exhaust blast, reduced by -1 per meter.

> (It can "stop any size of enemy armor?" Hardly. A Great Dragon, or a Bandit for that matter, can hardly scratch a Banshee, let alone a main battle tank, without careful aim. Reality check, anyone?) -Sten (12:32:49/10-21-54)
> (Too bad that on the high end, armor technology is outpacing armor-piercing technology. That state of affairs began nearly twenty years ago, when the new alloy-composite armor hit the field. Fortunately, the best stuff still costs plenty.) -Matador (02:10:09/10-25-54)
> (Remember that the Dragon is a man-portable weapon, not a vehicle-mounted anti-armor weapon. These are nasty fraggers.) -Leaguer (12:25:10/10-29-54)

## BALLISTA MULTI-ROLE MISSILE LAUNCHER
Manufactured by Saeder-Krupp's infamous Special Munitions branch, the sophisticated Ballista consists of a backpack mechanism that deploys a shoulder-firing missile tube. The Ballista missile can be used with the launcher inclined as an indirect-fire weapon, or as a direct-fire weapon balanced on the shoulder. The indirect-fire system revolves around microtronic compensators that align the tube at the proper angle regardless of the firer's position with respect to true vertical, and can fire Ballista Mk I or Mk II rounds. The directfire system operates similarly to other missile launchers and can fire Mk I, II, and III Ballista missiles.

\*See Weapon Range Table, p. 87.
See following page for information on Ballista rounds. Each type of magazine contains 4 rounds and can be replaced in 10 seconds. The Ballista itself takes 30 seconds to remove or put on, and has no rear blast zone. The weapon comes with a Type I Laser Designator (see pp. 85-86) for use in direct-fire mode only.

> (This device is vastly overpriced and too sophisticated for the common merc. Stick with weapons that are internally smart and don't need outside guidance. They're not infallible, but you can fire 'em and forget 'em.) -Matador (02:12:41/10-25-54)
> (It fits the "Future Trooper" concept, though: hardened battle armor, integrated comm and tactical data links, integral weapons, and so on. A laser-designator is only one of many targeting systems the Ballista can use; this weapon is modular and therefore easy to upgrade.) -Colonel Cobra (14:03:20/11-02-54)
> (Picture this: a High-Spy sensor drone roams the battlefield using a multifaceted sensor suite with infrared, thermal and radar imaging, optical recognition, and so on to identify hostiles. When it finds one, it downloads the targeting data-range and angle of launch and descent-to a viable friendly. The Ballista takes the data link, adjusts itself, and fires. The soldier just approves the launch.) -Sten (20:11:29/11-05-54)

## BALLISTA ROCKET & MISSILE ROUNDS
Custom-designed for the Saeder-Krupp Ballista launcher, Ballista rockets and missiles use a variety of warheads and targeting configurations. All types of rounds can be mixed and matched within a single magazine.

\*See Reflected-Energy Designators, p. 85.
The Mk I is an armor-piercing, dumb rocket, used for direct or indirect fire. Apply grenade rules given on p. 96, SRII. The Mk II is an armor-piercing, laser-tracking missile used for direct and indirect fire. See Reflected-Energy Designators, p. 85 of this book. The Mk III is an armor-piercing, semi-smart missile used only for direct fire.

> (Continuing from comments on the Ballista launcher, why bother with a soldier? Why not just use field drones?) -Tony's Tiger (20:41:09/11-08-54)
> (Eventually, they will. Plenty of people are investing meganuyen in hyper-expert and Al systems for combat vehicles. Some designers see flesh as a weak link; after all, you can't scare a computer.) -Colonel Cobra (03:20:18/11-09-54)

## M-12 MAN-PORTABLE MORTAR
An extremely dependable weapon, the M-12 mortar is based on a battleproven design. Its long barrel ends in a four-pronged base that digs into and anchors the weapon against the ground, and a swing-out, bipod brace props the weapon at a firing angle. The weapon's operator enters firing angles and environmental conditions manually into the controls of the barrel-mounted sight. In addition to sighting and firing the weapon himself, the operator can fire based on data from a spotter. The M-12 can fire "dumb" rounds or sophisticated, laser-tracking ammo.
See rules for smoke and white phosphorous mortars, pp. 85-86 of this book. For information on the M-12's special mortar rounds, see the following page. The mortar takes 3 minutes, or 36 turns, to set up and 18 turns to break down. It fires up to 2 rounds per Combat Turn, regardless of the number of Actions the firer has available.

> (Mortars. I keep thinking of the sysop's message up front, that a lot of the stuff in these files would interest shadowrunners. A mortar? A fraggin' mortar? Cut me loose!) -Singapore Sami (21:05:48/10-25-54)
> (A mortar might not be useful? I beg to differ. Maybe it's not part of a runner's dayto-day pack o' goodies, but it can come in handy. I orchestrated a run against a corp compound outside Los Angeles about two years ago, and my team peppered the area with smoke rounds as we went in. Filled the place up good. We used thermal sighting, which the corp boys didn't have. Going out, we also dropped a couple of HE rounds into the motor pool to discourage pursuit. Worked well.) -Kingslayer (20:28:36/10-29-54)
> (Kingslayer has a good point. A runner needs to look at more than the weapons he has on hand; to make a run work, construct a sound plan and then get the gear to make that plan work. Assuming any runner plans realistically, of course.] -Hatchetman (13:07:19/11-05-54)

## MORTAR ROUNDS HE
The M-12 Mortar takes all the types of rounds listed below. All rounds are drop-fired down the mortar barrel, their self-contained motors ignited by a pin at the barrel's bottom. All are fin-stabilized in flight, and arm only after they have cleared the barrel.

> (White phosphorus? I've got scars from that drek. I was working in Africa when a light plane buzzed our camp. Fraggin' plane carried a brace of rockets that the pilot dropped on us like bombs. They burst and spread phosphorus over the whole area. A year later, I found the pilot and skinned him like he'd done to me.) -Night Hunter (13:10:23/10-24-54)
> (Technically, white phosphorus is a chemical weapon and should fall under appropriate international guidelines. Though it rarely kills, it inflicts at least third-degree burns even through normal clothing. Using white phosphorus saddles your opponent with quite a problem-he has to care for many more wounded. It's so much easier to bury the dead.) -Colonel Cobra (05:20:14/11-05-54)

## SENTRY WEAPONS
The long-awaited Ares Arms Sentry™ weapons have finally arrived! The Sentry™ platform's unique modular system allows a merc or sec-force to customize it to suit specific needs. A fully-functioning "smart" system, a Sentry™ can recognize, track, and engage pre-set, situation-determined, or random targets within its zone of control. Its multi-aspect sensors cover the entire electromagnetic spectrum, allowing it to engage any target it can sense for effective, deadly control.

| Intelligence | Concealability | Weight | Cost       | Availability | Street Index |
| :----------- | -------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ | ------------ |

\* Plus weight of weapon, accessories, and ammunition.
\+ Each new sensor purchased adds +1 to the weapon's Intelligence Rating.
tt Standard weapon costs 22,000¥, plus 10 percent of purchase price for customization. Purchase ammo and recoil compensation per standard rules. Additional low-light, pulsed radar, ultrasound, and audio sensors with integration software/hardware cost 2,000¥ each. Improved targeting capability allows the gun barrel to incline 20° and decline 10° at a cost of 3,000¥.

All Sentry™ weapons include integrated thermographic and pulse-radar sensors. All have a base Initiative of 15 + 1D6, which can be raised to 20 + 2D6 at a cost of 10,000¥ or to 25 + 2D6 at a cost of 20,000¥. Every Sentry™ has the equivalent of Firearms Skill 5, increased by +1 at a cost of 5,000¥ and by +1 for every additional integrated sensor purchased. The Sentry™ system takes 5 minutes to assemble or take apart, and is designed around a tripod that holds a motorized weapon mount with 360degree rotation. The tripod provides 6 points of Recoil Compensation. The weapon mount holds any weapon from a submachine gun to a light machine gun, including new HVAR and HV/LMG weapons. Ammunition is belt-fed from a protected store that holds up to 2,000 rounds. For purposes of attacks against the system, the Sentry™ has a Barrier Rating of 12. For rules on Sentry™ gun operation, see Rules, p. 83.

> I've run into these a couple of times during regular merc work and "shadowrun" style ops. Perimeter and "hazardous area" security use them more frequently these days because they're easy to transport and set up. Also damn effective.) -Matador (04:20:45/11-05-54)
> (Ares is building a whole Industry around these bastards. Future options include optical recognition technology (you get shot if you look wrong), active sensor interrogation (you get shot if you don't have the right coded badge), and mobile-platform integration.) -Conqueror Wyrm (20:10:32/11-08-54)

## ARES MP LASER III
Ares Arms strikes again! Four years after introducing their revolutionary MP Laser, Ares has trimmed the price by an astounding 2,000 percent and begun mass production. An ideal weapon for the sophisticated mercenary or security force, the MP-Laser III is a self-contained, single-carrier system designed for instant reaction to and containment of serious threats. Hip-mounted, peak-discharge battery packs, designed for rapid exchange, can be recharged for future use.

To determine range, consult the Weapon Range Table (see Rules, p. 87) and decrease the weapon's Power Level by -2 for each range beyond Short (Medium -2, Long -4, Extreme -6). Ballistic Armor has no effect; reduce Impact Armor by half, rounded down. The laser does not pierce armor, and suffers the standard -1 Damage reduction when used against vehicles. Smoke reduces the laser's Power Level by -1 for every 2 meters of smoke the beam passes through. Recoil modifiers do not apply.

> (Perhaps I can shed some light on this. For years, the Neon Samurai has spread slander against Ares Arms, claiming that the company killed a certain Doctor Elliot Mills-Fargo after he created the key patents for the MP Laser.

To determine range, consult the Weapon Range Table (see Rules, p. 87). Decrease the weapon's Power Level by -2 for each range beyond Short (Medium -2, Long -4, Extreme -6). Ballistic Armor has no effect; reduce Impact Armor by half, rounding down. The armor-piercing beam suffers the standard -1 Damage Level reduction when used against vehicles. Smoke reduces the Power Level by -1 for every 4 meters of smoke the beam passes through. Recoil modifiers do not apply.

## TRACERS
The American Ammo Co. proudly announces improvements to its current explosive and tracer ammunition products. Now, the EX Ammo line provides more explosion and fragmentation than ever before, at a minimal cost increase. The ViewFlight line of tracer ammunition has also been updated to provide an even more accurate ballistic path and brighter burn! American Ammo; for all your ammo needs! 

|              | Concealability | Damage    | Weight | Availability | Cost | Street Index |
| ------------ | -------------- | --------- | ------ | ------------ | ---- | ------------:|
| EX Explosive | 8              | See below | .75    | 6/72 hrs     | 100¥ |          1.5 |
| Tracer       | 8              | See below | .5     | 3/24 hrs     | 75¥  |            1 |
EX explosive rounds add +2 to the Power of the weapon, but use all other standard rules. Tracer rounds can be used only in full-auto weapons, and are loaded every third round in the clip. Non-smartgun users receive an additional -1 target number modifier at ranges beyond Short, cumulative with every third round fired (-1 after first three, -2 after six, and so on). When calculating burst damage for three round, multiple-round, or short-round bursts, do not add a bonus to the Power for the tracer round, but do increase the Damage Level appropriately. For example, a sub-machinegun using a 5M round and firing 10 rounds would have a Damage Code of 12D, normally 15D.

> (It's a common misconception that "exploding" rounds are like microgrenades. Not true. Yes, there's a detonation, but the load is so minor it's really like an impressive fragmentation. Also, the rounds tend to detonate early, especially when punching through body armor of any weight. So no, you don't shoot somebody and then get to watch him blow up.) -Teague (12:10:13/8-22-94)
> (I've heard that Ares or someone is working on an explosive compound that detonates on contact with moisture. It's like a plastic explosive, so it blows up good when # hits, say, a body. That will let you shoot somebody and watch them blow up.) Gabe (21:51:52/8-22-94)
> (Geez! What are you, twelve years old or something? Think about what you just said. Moisture? That's got to be one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. Grow up. Get a life. Leave us alone.) -Monster Eater (08:20:17/8-23-94)

## GEL-PACK ARMOR
When you need something tougher than soft-cloth ballistic armor, step up to real protection. Kelmar Tech's patented gel-pack technology provides hardened protection against penetration along with maximum comfort and flexibility. Kelmar gel-packs remain liquid and flexible until the shock wave of a projectile impact solidifies the gel into an impenetrable barrier. As the kinetic energy dissipates, the gel liquefies, ready to absorb the next impact. Kelmar's military-spec combat armor is the best of the best!
Mil-spec gel packs can be added to any available armor. With the addition of gelpacks, treat armor as Hardened at its normal Ballistic and Impact ratings. If applicable, reduce Concealability by half (rounded down). The gel-packs increase all armor's weight by 25 percent, multiply its cost by 5, double its Street Index and Availability target number, and quadruple the time required to get it.
If a weapon's Power, before burst or autofire modifications, does not exceed the modified armor's rating, the round does not penetrate and does no damage. If a weapon's Power exceeds the armor's rating, reduce the rating per standard Shadowrun rules. Penetration reduces the armor's rating by 1 per penetration.

> (I used this gel drek once working in the south of France. We're geared for a little night action, so I'm strapped into a set of mil-spec light security armor and running a full electronics suite, interlinked with all my team members, exchanging data at the speed of light. We penetrate the complex and BOOM! my happy feet trigger a Sentry gun (sorry I ain't gonna type in that fraggin' (TM)!) sporting an HV/LMG. The burst knocks me back a couple of meters and leaves me staring at stars. Am I alive? Yup. Do I hurt? Oh, yeah. Can i move? Nooooo. Know why? The gel doesn't liquefy. It stays hard and leaves me stiff as a plank. The tech-heads told me it was a "multiple shock-wave resonance effect." One in a million, they said. Never happen again, they said. I won't play those odds.) - Night Fighter (08:23:14/11-10-54)
> (I've found that mil-spec versions of most conventional armor is pointless against ballistics. It doesn't stop a round all that much better than soft cloth armor, which is a misnomer: after all, plates are standard in soft body armor. Against blades, though, milspec comes in handy-assuming a troll doesn't take a stab at you.) -Tuna Boy (10:20:11/11-13-54)
## MILITARY GRADE ARMOR
The military traditionally kept the best for themselves. Now, Esprit Industries of France brings you mil-spec quality on the open market! Esprit's new line of military-grade combat armor offers full protection, hard and softarmor integration, energy dispersal, thermal dampening options, intrasuit wiring conduits, surface antenna matrices, the works. Available in standard or custom camouflage patterns, these suits are a must for the serious fighter.

|                       | Ballistic | Impact | Weight    | Availability | Cost    | Street Index |
| --------------------- | --------- | ------ | --------- | -----------: | ------- | ------------ |

| Medium Military Armor | 12        | 8      | 14 + Body |     24/1 mth | 45,000¥ | 3            |
| Heavy Military Armor  | 14        | 9      | 16 + Body |  28/1.5 mths | 70,000¥ | 3            |
| Heavy Military Helmet | +2        | +3     | 3.0       |     24/1 mth | 2,500¥  | 3            |
Treat military-grade armor as Hardened. Suits are designed to integrate combat electronics, including the BattleTac™ system. Military-grade armor reduces the wearer's Combat Pool by 1 for every 2 points of Ballistic Armor Rating above the character's Quickness Rating.

> (Shadowrunners shouldn't even think about this stuff except in the most extreme circumstances. It looks like what it is-military-grade armor. I've seen people wearing this gear with all the accessories, and they don't look human. Makes me shake to think about it.) -Rapid Fire (08:21:28/11-09-54)
> (I heard Fuchi's working on a fully-powered version of this kind of armor: strength amplification, jump-pack system, integrated weapons, the works. Anybody else heard anything?) -Shade (20:21:28/11-13-54)
> Just rumors, but I heard it was Ares, not Fuchi.) -Hyper-Volt (17:25:40/11-24-54)
> (Fuchi? That'll be the day.) -Nightfire (08:27:35/11-25-54)

## COUGAR FINE BLADE KNIFE

The Fineblade knife has no special properties.
> This is an interesting weapon option that offers much the same effect as Dikoting™ at a greatly reduced price. Ironically, at a weapons show in Cairo last year I watched a salesman show this weapon to an interested young lady, in the process severing two fingers. Quite a demonstration.) -Tyrus (8-15-94/3:20:14)
> (Dikote™ is more effective, especially because it has antiarmor capability. Fletcher, a friend of mine with an almost unnatural affection for archery, uses Dikote™ arrowheads almost exclusively- to great effect. I've also seen Dikote™. coated crossbow bolts blow straight through an armored passenger car and come out the other side pretty bloody. ) -Dennis 'D' (13:11:18/8-21-94)

> (One of my best career moves was to learn mountaineering. I feel much more confident, so I can ascend, descend, and traverse much faster and more efficiently. My exposure is down significantly, and I am a much happier troll.) -Able (04:28:28/11-05-54)
> (WOW! Sorry, I just flashed on walking down the street and seeing a troll rappelling down a skyscraper toward me. One question that only just occurred to me: how easily available is troll- and ork-sized gear? I see socalled "normal" stuff everyday, but what about "Real Big Man" stuff?) -Lord Fly (21:28:15/11-08-54)
> (Some things are more common than others. For example, I can simply buy some climbing gear at a greater tensile strength than anything small folk would buy for themselves. In general, though, ork-sized stuff costs 50 percent more and troll-sized stuff doubles in price. Bulldrek like that keeps my people in the slums.) :- Able (05:10:13/11-10-54)

> (Truthfully, I wonder if the upgrade is worth the price. Most of the improvements really only matter to tech-heads. The weapon feels more alert (weird sensation), and the range finder linkage becomes handy at longer ranges, but I just don't know.] -Fitzburg (03:29:16/11-12-54)
> (Fitz, old boy, for some of us that uncertainty makes the package.) -Grouper (20:18:16/11-13-54)
> (The specs don't say anything about it, but I just got a Smartlink Level Il and it interfaces with my vehicle control rig. I get full status and targeting info off any "smart" vehicle weapon when I'm rigging, in addition to the standard basic data overlays. I'm definitely more accurate with smartlinked weapons now. I found all this out because I needed to swap out an LMG that had fouled. The only one we had was already "smart," and I didn't have time to take out the brains.) -Georgi (23:29:41/11-15-54)

Using BattleTac™ requires a Special Skill: Small Unit Tactics and BattleTac™. Users receive an additional -2 modifier to all target numbers whenever the network is active. For more information, see p. 84.

> (Sorry, chummers. This drek means the "Future Trooper" is now. See, vehicles can also use BattleTac™. Let's say Dog Soldier Sylvia sees an enemy unit approaching her hideaway. She feeds that data into the network, and seconds later a trio of Stonewall MBTs sitting silently in a field kilometers away start dropping death on the enemy unit. Imagine this kind of hook-up with artillery, air-to-ground weapons, homing mortar rounds, and so on. The modern battlefield is data, people. Believe it, or die.) -Matador (11:34:29/11-19-54)

> (I've used the Nightglider on several occasions. It's a pretty good transport, but don't try anything fancy or it'll come apart. Avoid ground fire and hard landings at all costs.) -Matador (04:29:17/11-10-54)
> (I also question the landing/takeoff information. Landing vertically is easy, because the stall-speed is so low you can pretty much coast in and land it, like a hang glider. Taking off is another story. You can take her up almost vertically by redlining the engine, but that sucks away about 25 percent of your battery power. It also kicks engine heat way up, which wrecks the bird's signature-but if you've got the watts to spare, go for it. You'll get off the ground fast.) -Desert Vet (20:14:23/11-15-54)
> (I wish the airframe was a little tougher. It can take a firmpoint, and I usually bring up light cargo like ECM/ECCM gear and some sensors, but I still feel vulnerable.) -Trap Door Tex (21:18:41/11-16-54)

## GMC MPUV
The GMC multi-purpose utility vehicle (MPUV) is the world's most popular light combat vehicle, perfect for every use from light scout to personnel transport. Lightly armored against small-arms fire, the four-wheel drive MPUV can handle almost any situation.

Additional Features: Accessories include a radio transceiver, white-light searchlight, roll bars, and roof pintle mount with access hatch. Some MPUVs come with a single hardpoint. Weapons not included.
\*Off-road speed is 30/90.

> (Ah, the ubiquitous MPUV. You can even see street-legal versions in some areas. Trés chic, don't ya know.) -Hummer Hal (08:29:37/11-28-54)
> (This entry is too vague about the vehicle's real capabilities. I've seen versions mounting anti-tank weapons, local-area sensor platforms, even light anti-aircraft missiles or autocannons. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is that its armor is too weak to stand up to real weapons and its relatively poor signature.) -Colonel Cobra (21:02:21/11-30-54)
> (Sure, but trying to improve signature cripples the vehicle. The engine can't handle the extra load. I knew a merc unit that sensor-masked a bunch of MPUVs. Fraggin' things kept overheating. They could have installed extra coolant systems, but that gets expensive.) -Tiger Team (20:54:28/12-02-54)

## LAV-98 "DEVIL RAT" APC
The major transport of both the Confederated American States and California Free State, the Devil Rat armored personnel carrier (APC) is part of the arsenals of the world's major militaries and corporations. Able to deploy up to eight soldiers while providing fire support, the Devil Rat is the perfect choice for combat and combat-support missions.

> (Devil Rat's a death trap if you ask me. I've seen too many of them light up after a hit near the ammo or fuel. The armor seems sufficient for its job, but ya gotta wonder when they go off like grenades all over the battlefield.) -Cougar Punch (03:21:27/11-30-54)
> (Poor maintenance, Coug. Check those maintenance and tech people. Are they sealing all the conduits after servicing? Checking regularly for micro-leaks in the fuel lines, too small to notice but big enough for a fireball or spark to set off? Are the seals on the ammo feeds and bins solid or rotted? If someone's checking and you still got problems, you got a saboteur.) Flying Wallenchek (21:34:09/12-01-54)
> (I'll second that. We field Devil Rats regularly and have had no problems. Sure, they pop when an ATGM hits them, but that's no surprise.) -Winter Rat (18:43:55/12-05-54)

## LAV-103 "STRIKER" LIGHT TANK OR THUNDER THIGHS
Based on a reinforced version of the popular Devil Rat suspension and drive train, the LAV-103 "Striker" light tank has heavier armor and packs a heavier punch without loss of speed! Improvements to the engine and transmission enable this heavy fire-support vehicle to match the speeds of lighter tanks. Comes in amphibious and anti-air configurations, making the Striker a popular vehicle in many theaters of operation.

Additional Features: Comes with telecommunications system (Rating 0), and EnviroSeal™, and medium remote turret. Weapons not included.
\*Off-road speed is 15/45.

> (The Striker configuration we use most often mounts a Victory rotary assault cannon. We've tried to construct the unit around the same class of heavy weapons so that they all use variants on the same ammo. It works pretty well, though obviously we'd like the heavier firepower of an actual autocannon on occasion.) -Ultra-Drek (23:59:30/12-01-54)
> (Ultra, you are weird. I've never heard of such a thing on the scale you're talking. Maybe for small arms, but for cannon rounds?) -Tuber (20:20:14/12-02-054)
> (Not really weird. I've worked with plenty of low-budget countries that bought their vehicles surplus. Want to hear about a logistical nightmare? Of the seven different kinds of light combat vehicles they fielded, none fired the same ammo. Yeeesh.) -Merc Mania (18:28:41/12-030-54)
> (Seven different cannons in the same class ?? That's stupid !!! ) -Weasel (04:21:40/12-06-54)

## C-60 TITAN MEDIUM TRANSPORT
A common sight in corporate, military, and mercenary forces around the world, the C-260 is the perfect workhorse. With the right modifications, this transport can become a powerful air-to-ground weapons platform or a long range sensor platform. An excellent all-purpose aircraft!

> (This sucker flies like a fraggin' brick wall. If you're flying one of these and somebody shoots a marginally intelligent missile at you, or (god forbid) comes after you in an aircraft, you'd better hope you've got enough electronics to spook them. You sure as hell ain't gonna fly out of trouble.) -Wildcat (13:56:41/12-03-54) > (Heh. You've never seen one of our Titans, have you? Sensor suite to dream over: underwing AAMs, chaff and flare dispensers, the works. Costs money, but it's cheaper than losing the plane.) -Winter Rat (04:20:53/12-05-54)

> Why risk personnel unless you have to? These days I see plenty of Condors, Condor IIs, and Dalmatians over the battlefield. Well funded units (read: corp) even put up BattleTac™ electronics with a full sensor package. The things you can do with that kind of tactical information!) -Widgit (04:20:14/12-05-54)
> (Drones are too vulnerable. Any dog with a rocket can drop them. It's got a good signature, but still makes too easy a target. I stopped using them a few years ago.) -Wombat Warrior (21:48:39/12-06-54)
> (Just because drones loiter well doesn't mean you want to limit their movement in such a way. I've seen plenty of poorly trained drone controllers spot a target and circle it while they tell somebody what they've seen. Bad move.) - Matador (18:20:00/12-07-54)
> (Always keep your drone moving, even if it's on autopilot.) -Flyer XX (02:19:10/12-10-54)

## FERRET RPD-VI PERIMETER DRONE
The small, silent Ferret RPD-VI makes the perfect low-maintenance perimeter-security drone. Equipped with sophisticated sensors and a smart autopilot, the Ferret can patrol an area quietly, alert central security when it detects an intruder, and illuminate them with its searchlight or a targeting laser on demand. Use several to cover acres of ground-nothing gets past the Ferret!

Additional Features: Remote-control gear installed. 3 CF available for sensors, ECM/ECCM equipment, or vehicle control gear. Also includes white-light searchlight.
Laser designator not included (for more information, see p. 85).

> (Maximum security installations love these things. They lay 'em all over an area, and an intruder can't tell where they'll be because the little bastards wander in random patterns. Th|Typeey're all over the slot who breaks in-lights, lasers, sensors, the works. Next thing the poor slob knows, sentry weapons are opening up from everywhere-with the Ferrets telling the gun where to aim, they ain't gonna miss.) -Shadow Vault (23:21:01/12-02-54)
> (Ferrets only matter if you're going in quiet. If it doesn't matter, drop a grenade. Kills them like flies.) -Howler (20:18:41/12-04-54)

## WASP/YELLOWJACKET "F" SERIES UPGRADE.
After careful analysis of years of field-use and after-action reports, Northrup Industries offers the "F" series upgrade for its PRC-42 Wasp and PRC44 Yellowjacket light security helicopters. The "F" series offers enhanced small-arms protection, improved handling, engine upgrades to maintain performance, and a reduced signature that makes the Wasp or Yellowjacket a competitor in any market! Fleet-upgrade discounts are available through all Northrup representatives.

| Type                 | Handling | Sig | B/A |     Cost |
| -------------------- | -------- | --- | --- | --------:|
| Wasp Upgrade         | -1       | +2  | 2/6 |  74,000¥ |
| Yellowjacket Upgrade | -1       | +2  | 3/9 | 110,000¥ |
For standard Yellowjacket and Wasp statistics, see pp. 70-71, Rigger Black Book, or p. 74, Street Samurai Catalog.

> (After-action reports !!! How about "Some kid with a BB gun shot me down ?? Or "I'da caught him but he outran me on foot ?? " Give me a break! These things are like toys; hit them with anything and they fall down. No upgrade can cure that!) -Wylie Eye (23:28:17/12-06-54)
> (You didn't read the entry very carefully, did you, Wylie? This upgrade lets the Wasp bounce light pistol ammo and absorb the heavier stuff, and the Yellowjacket bounce pretty much everything that classifies as a non-heavy weapon. I'd think twice about playing with these Insects.) -Mooch (10:18:45/12-07-54)

## VEHICLE SMOKE GENERATOR
Need fast cover? Need a way to break a laser designator's beam? Vehicle smoke generators are the answer to your prayers! Spew smoke on demand from an externally mounted canister that can be triggered from inside the vehicle. Huge, dense clouds cover the battlefield in no time! Special thermal smoke blocks IR-sensing thermographic sensor systems, at only 20 percent over standard costs.

| Type                  | Number of Charges |   Cost |
| --------------------- | ----------------- | ------:|
| Small Smoke Generator | 6                 |   700¥ |
| Large Smoke Generator | 12                | 1,000¥ |
Each charge covers a given area. For smoke rules, see p. 85.

> (Heh-heh. Reminds me of the time I chased down a well equipped rebel force in Nicaragua. One of the Appaloosas we were after decided to blow some smoke. The scout was running at more than 100 KPH trailing this long, thin black line. Sensors or no sensors, we could have found the fools by that smoke. Made me laugh.) -Winter Rat (03:20:14/12-07-54)

## ABLATIVE VEHICLE ARMOR
Looking for a little more armor protection for your vehicle? European Arm Works (EAW) has the answer in its new line of modular ablative armor. Designed to attach to the vehicle's exterior, ablative armor absorbs the kinetic energy of any blast. A hit blows the armor plates clear, but they save you from sudden death! Three different available levels let you choose the degree of protection you need! Not usable on aircraft.

| Armor Level | Availability |   Cost | Street Index |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------:| ------------ |
| 1           | 8/14 days    |   700¥ | 2            |
| 2           | 12/14 days   | 1,600¥ | 2            |
| 3           | 14/21 days   | 2,500¥ | 2            |
Ablative armor adds twice its level to a vehicle's effective Armor Rating, to a maximum equal to its Body. When struck by an attack with a Power greater than 3 times the armor level, reduce the increase in the Armor Rating by -1. It takes 6 hours to install ablative armor, which cannot be concealed. Ablative armor is not Hardened.
