### ADVENTURE IDEAS

Cop and corporate-security campaigns offer opportunities for more roleplaying and social interaction than the average shadowrun. Characters must work reasonably within the law, and so will almost always try to solve things by talking before resorting to violence. Despite Lone Star's brutal trid image, any cop who consistently shoots before speaking will find himself in court or on the streets pretty quickly. Cop and corporate-security characters also have to work within a corporate structure, answering to higher-ups, working together or competing with contemporaries and mentoring newbies. This offers opportunities for social Interaction beyond contacts from whom characters get weapons and information, and also for enemies who subtly attack a character's career and ego rather than his physical person.

When running cop/corp campaigns, keep in mind that when the dangerous drek goes down, the first thing most cops do is call for backup. This action may be realistic, but it isn't much fun for the players to know that their characters will always have fifty fellow cops ready to cover them should they screw up. The gamemaster must make sure that the characters can get into high-suspense situations where a lot depends on a few moves made only by the protagonists. In other words, look more to cop movies for inspiration than to "real-world" police operations. Encourage characters to have moral codes, doing the right thing even if the chief has been bribed to look the other way, or to use their contacts and skills to help a group on the side of "good" but not on the side of the law (metahuman rights, ecoterrorists and so on).

Another technique is the "nobody ever goes in or comes out" ploy. The characters may not be able to call for backup for some reason-for example, they've been kidnapped and their radios taken, or they're inside a barrier like the Bug City containment zone. Alternatively, backup may not be able to reach them-terrorists may control of the building they're in, or they started exploring some mysterious sewer tunnels and now they don't know where they are. Techniques like these put the story Into the hands of the player characters, making for a more exciting and memorable game.

The cop character has an ambiguous relationship with the streets. He or she may have come from there, his or her most interesting work takes place there, and yet the people of the streets most likely despise and fear the cop. Nonetheless, cops must be able to work with people in the shadows. When conducting an investigation, having contacts is as helpful for cops as for shadowrunners. Cops tend to use their contacts much more actively to "get a feel" for what's happening on the street. The Negotiation rules (Spilling the Beans, p. 69) can make these interviews interesting. Some contacts may also have a hold over the character: for example, a yakuza oyabun who helps a cop out with the occasional bit of information may successfully blackmail that same cop to open a smuggling channel into a local prison.

When running a cop campaign, the gamemaster should have a plausible reason for involving a small group of people rather than a large team. Creating specialty teams or SWAT teams is one way to do this: having a big event occur elsewhere that drains all the NPCs away so that the player characters are the only ones left is another. This type of campaign also works well If you have a very small group of players (1-3) and would like to run an intimate game that requires a lot of investigation rather than combat.

Corporate security functions in the same way as cops for the most part, save that they have an even more limited range of operations. Most often they stay on the grounds of their parent corp. To keep the game varied, consider sending CorpSec characters on undercover missions or varying the types of security crises (a gang attack, an assault by chromed-to-the-teeth or magically powerful runners, an internal-affairs investigation, a rampage by wild paranormal animals, a wageslave gone postal and so on). You can also create campaigns around personal friendships and enmities, or have the characters inadvertently uncover their corp's dirty secrets. Starting out with characters who work for Aztechnology with no idea of its reputation, then having them stumble over increasingly clear evidence of blood magic and sacrifices, can lead up to an emotional climax as the characters decide whether to continue working for the corp they now know is evil or risk everything they have to do what is right. (If they leave, of course, they can go directly to traditional Shadowrun.).

Corporate characters often have shaky relationships with their street contacts. Most often they are either bribing the contact for information-and they'd better keep up the payments in the game or suffer the consequences-or they are personal friends from before the corp character went legit, in which case the character must consider how deeply he or she wants to drag a friend into trouble.

Corp/cop adventures do not center around making money, and characters can't really steal and/or loot bodies because they have no access to a black market at which to sell their pickings. An easy way to make the campaign tougher is to slash the corporate or precinct budget: this means the characters may not be able to get their hands on the best equipment, or even equipment that works, and they may also not have the cash to grease all the palms that need it. As with special-forces campaigns, corporate and cop characters are more likely to have normal lives than shadowrunners. If a character's whole family is tied up with the corporation, might he or she think twice about leaving after finding out about Aztechnology's evil experiments?. Or if a cop spends months tracking down some piece of shadowrunner scum only to find out that the runner is her little sister who ran away two years ago, how will she react to that discovery?.

### Going Undercover

An adventure in which an individual or group must go undercover is difficult to pull off and poses some obvious problems, such as the short life expectancy of an undercover character if his or her cover is broken. Also, the gamemaster must create a complete undercover environment for the character or the group. Finally, an undercover adventure is likely to be high on social skills and sweet talking, and low on combat action. If well-roleplayed, however, an undercover campaign can create an interesting story and loads of opportunity for character interaction.

When playing an undercover character, design him or her as if the character actually is the person he is disguised as (shadowrunner, organized-crime member, gang member). The character must also have a Skill Rating of at least 3 in Corporate (Police) Etiquette and the type of Etiquette most needed to succeed at his or her undercover profession.

If the players are willing to risk it, an undercover campaign can lead to some intense and memorable scenes when a character's cover is broken and he must break the law in order to prove his loyalty to his new bosses. A super twist is to have an undercover cop be a member of a shadowrunning team. Keep in mind that no matter how well the character plays his or her runner role-or even if the character decides he prefers his runner buddies to being a cop and ultimately takes to the street himself-other players and their characters don't like feeling foolish. When the character's cover is broken, as it will be eventually, that character will have to do some quick and convincing talking to stay alive, and even then the enraged runners may kill the character out of spite.

### CAMPAIGNING WITH THE LAW

The following section complements the Archetypal Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.

- **The Premise** The characters are trying to hang on to the moral high ground in a world of chaos. They stick to the ideal of the law, if not always the letter of it, and must often face corruption in their own organization. This premise makes an interesting change from most campaigns, where the characters are "criminal scum" (shadowrunners): cop characters might even find themselves outsmarting and hauling in a few shadowrunners from time to time!.
    

Law enforcement characters try to uphold the ideals of "good cops" and deal with crime and corruption in their jurisdiction as well as within their organization. The player characters are members of a single crime squad, or perhaps an elite unit such as a Lone Star Fast Response Team. They work together all the time, and form the kind of bonds that people only form with those who save their necks on a regular basis; there are no loners in a cop squad. The unit may include magicians and adepts as magical support, though such characters must answer to the magical specialty division of the organization for which the characters work. Most cop squads also include a decker to provide needed technical support.

The characters work in a distinct locale, dealing with criminal activity in their particular city or precinct if they're cops and keeping tabs on the corporate site to which they've been assigned if they're CorpSec. Though they may have to deal with their company's or organization's home office at times, most of their attention is confined to the local area. Cop/corp campaigns lend themselves to any good-sized city or metroplex like Seattle. The gamemaster can create some interesting variations by choosing cities outside the UCAS or CAS and focusing on those cities' unique aspects and problems, such as Los Angeles, Denver, Vancouver (in Salish-Shiche) and Portland (in Tir Tairngire).

- **The Goal** To a cop character, being a "good cop" is the most important thing in the world. Without good people to uphold the law, anarchy reigns and people get hurt. There is nothing worse than a bad cop, because a bad cop corrupts the law. People deserve protection from crime, and so sometimes you have to bend the rules a little to put criminals away. But you can't bend the rules too much, even if sometimes that means letting the bad guys go.
    

Cop and CorpSec characters have an immediate reason for working together and clearly set goals for dealing with criminal scum; they also have enough leeway to act on their own initiative. They have fewer worries about getting gear than the average shadowrunner character, and the gamemaster has more control over character advancement. The cop/corp campaign shows players "the other side of the street" and lets them be on the side of Law and Order for a change.

- **Opposition** The player characters have plenty of ready-made opponents In the criminal element with which they must deal daily. Organized crime offers quite a few powerful adversaries: the characters are also likely to tangle with small-time criminals such as gangs, smugglers, gamblers, con artists and shadowrunners. Other interesting opposition may be corruption within the characters' organization or precinct. Bad cops, corrupt political officials, political pressure from higher-ups and the like can be much more difficult for the characters to fight than simple street scum. Cop characters might also have trouble from rival police or security organizations, especially if a contract dispute is going on or some other company wants to muscle in on the police business in the player characters' city.
    

The campaign is likely to see plenty of violence with characters who work the mean streets every day, but the mayhem is of a different kind than most shadowrunners encounter. Cops are bound by the law and company regulations about the use of deadly force; sensational trid stories to the contrary, they should never deal with a problem by shooting first and asking questions later. Cop and CorpSec characters will have the advantage of the best modern weapons and armor that nuyen can buy (unless their department is underfunded, as many are); however, they should still be careful. Shadowrunners can be tricky opponents, after all.

- **Complications** Some players may find the rules and restrictions of working in a police organization-especially the limits in equipment and advancement-too constricting. Certain "square peg" character types such as shamans might have a tough time fitting into the campaign. Also, the players can become complacent and lazy if all their characters' activities are dictated by their superior officers.
    

Unless the characters are part of an elite group like an FRT, they probably aren't cyber-gods or Nth-grade initiates; they're most likely just ordinary cops trying to do their job. The characters have the advantages of professional training and whatever backing and equipment their organization provides, so they shouldn't have to worry much about scrounging for gear unless they want something that isn't regulation. Magician characters will have free access to the organization's magical equipment and resources, and may also have an in-house initiate group to teach them the higher mysteries at some future point. Decker characters will have the chance to play with a number of systems legitimately (for a change), and they also have free access to their own organization's hi-tech systems. The company rules and regulations offer a plausible rationale for the gamemaster to control character advancement and any new cyber or magical abilities that players want their characters to acquire.

As a general rule, the player characters stay in one area most of the time, leaving only when transferred to a different unit. However, such transfers may be as frequent as the gamemaster desires. Corp security teams come up for review fairly often in the fast-paced economy of the Awakened world, and so player-character teams could be transferred to anywhere in the world. They may be ordered to shore up existing security, request a transfer upon realizing that their superiors are corrupt or inefficient, or arrange for their own disappearance to another corp or the shadows.

### DOUBLE, DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE

The magical campaign puts an interesting twist on a Shadowrun game because it revolves around encounters with, research into and exploration of the eerie and often formidable mystic powers of the Awakened world. From uncovering the truth behind Aztechnology to discovering the real purpose of the Atlantean Foundation or the ultimate scheme of the Illuminates of the New Dawn, magical investigations have an otherworldy feel that players may find appealing. Less like shadowrunners and more.like scholarly investigators, characters in a magical campaign face all kinds of dangers-especially the fear of the unknown.

### CHARACTER CREATION

Most or all of the player characters in a magical campaign should have some kind of magical ability, though the occasional mundane character can be added to make things interesting. This type of campaign works best if all the player characters are members of the same magical order or lodge or other initiatory group: this automatically gives them a history together and will likely give them a goal as well. Many of the characters' activities must remain hidden in order to conceal the order's secrets from mundane humanity. The group may work toward the goals of their order, lodge, government or organization, or may work against another organization. The magical campaign offers a perfect opportunity to use the adept characters that appear in many Shadowrun products.

A magical campaign can be more aggressive on all levels if its members are working for someone else, preferably a powerful backer. In this case, not all the team members need be magically active. The Atlantean Foundation's Mystic Crusaders (p. 58, Threats) are an excellent organization for this type of campaign, as is the Dunkelzahn Institute for Magical Research (p. 25, Portfolio of a Dragon).

### ADVENTURE IDEAS

The world of Shadowrun is full of magical sites, items, people, creatures, spirits and organizations. Most are secret: some are so secret that the only evidence of their existence is the occasional whispered rumor. A magical campaign can easily take on the feel of a regular shadowrun-for example, sneaking into the local Aztechnology facility to find out what magical research is going on there. Others may feel like an archaeological expedition-such as investigating a power site, mana line or magical anomaly like the Mojave Desert. Still other adventures may cast the player characters as astral investigators looking into the metaplanes. And of course, an ongoing covert war against another magical group or society is always a good adventure hook.

### CAMPAIGNING WITH MAGIC

The following section complements the Archetypal Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.

- **The Premise** Characters in a magical campaign travel wherever they must for their work. They might hit the Bermuda Triangle one week, Egypt the next and Glastonbury. England the week after that. This type of campaign lets the gamemaster offer a wide variety of exotic and magical settings for adventures, but also makes it extremely important for the characters to have a stable "home base" with their organization so that they can deal with regular recurring NPCs.
    

Magicans as a group tend to feel that they have a greater stake in the workings of the universe because magic is neither good nor bad-that judgment applies only to specific uses of it. And "bad magic" is almost always very, very bad. Therefore, magical campaigns tend to be large-scale, with far-reaching implications for at least the characters' magical order and possibly even the world.

- **The Goal** This type of campaign is ideal for players who want to explore different aspects of magic in the Sixth World, including the metaplanes and the many different types of spirits and paranormal critters. It also offers the chance to use different exotic locations. The tone of a magical campaign is open to interpretation, but assumes that the player characters are all seeking knowledge and truth (however they define it) and have plans for using that knowledge. If the players can handle the complexity, their group might even have a mixture of goals and motivations. Some characters might seek knowledge for its own sake, some might be looking for magical power, and others may be seeking to protect mundane humanity from various magical threats.
    

The moral tone of the campaign, whatever it may be, can be strongly expressed through the strictures of the magical group to which the characters belong (p. 54, Grimoire). This set-up gives the campaign some added weight because a character who violates too many strictures can be expelled from the order. If this happens, the character would most likely have to leave the group.

- **Opposition** The major opponents characters are likely to face in this type of campaign are members of rival magical orders. Knowledge is power, and magicians seek knowledge above all else. Rival groups working at cross purposes may contend with each other to get their hands on some valuable magical lore, or to snatch a hidden magical treasure from some ancient site or ruin. Groups like the Illuminates of the New Dawn. Aztlan blood mages, the Black Lodge, Winternight and the Atlantean Foundation are all possible rivals for the player characters (for more information on these groups, see Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon). Individual magicians such as toxic shamans can also provide hefty challenges.
    

Other major antagonists for a magical order are powerful spirits: free spirits, insect spirits and even the mysterious Enemy. if the gamemaster so desires. The free spirit Tutor (p. 92, Threats) makes an excellent opponent, as do many of the other magical enemies described in that sourcebook.

Though the magical campaign is primarily investigative, it has the potential for some truly spectacular magical battles, as well as grand-scale physical conflict on the astral plane and the metaplanes. Mundane characters may be most useful in this type of campaign as bodyguards for the less brawny magicians in the group. If desired, the characters might be members of a physically-oriented organization, such as a martial arts dojo. Such a campaign would be well-suited for physical adept and physical magician characters (see p. 119, Awakenings).

- **Complications** The campaign's focus on magic can be its greatest weakness as well as its greatest strength. For players not especially interested in magic, a magical campaign can quickly grow tiresome. Also, a magical campaign's narrow focus can tend to make all the player characters seem the same; they all know the same spells, have similar magical skills, and so on. To avoid this pitfall, the gamemaster should encourage players to create more specialized characters than a typical Shadowrun magician.
    

Player characters are likely to develop considerable magical power as the campaign progresses, and so gamemasters are advised to keep a close eye on how characters spend their Karma for advancement. Remind your players that non-magical skills and abilities are useful in various situations, and encourage the players to buy them. The gamemaster may also wish to set an upper limit on magical skills such as sorcery and conjuring so that no character grows out of control.

### THIS IS OUR TURF, MEAT

Shadowrun makes an ideal environment for a gang campaign. This type of campaign allows players to play characters who don't have it all under control. They're just above squatters on the food chain and have to fight for every inch of ground they get. They can't fight without thought because there are predators a lot bigger and meaner than they are on the streets. So if gang characters want to survive, they have to think. A last-resort home of sorts for people who've been used and abused by the system, a gang is a social club, shadowrunning group, terrorist organization and law enforcement (of a sort) for their home turf. Usually led by a charismatic leader, gangers tend to belong to disenfranchised groups: racial, ethnic or economic. They band together and form mini-societies with their own rules, attitudes, prejudices and goals.

A gang campaign offers an immediate means of getting a group of characters together and keeping them that way by forging bonds of cooperation and loyalty between them. The campaign also allows for a lower power level so that the players and gamemaster can concentrate on character development and personal interaction rather than simply accumulating various toys. The following campaign notes apply to small neighborhood or area gangs, not city-wide or national forces.

### GANG CREATION

Forming a gang gives outcast individuals the protection of numbers and the advantage (physical and psychological) of backup when on the offensive. They also provide the only way for a shadowrunner wannabe to have something to hold onto in a world gone crazy. The gang gives him a group of friends his own age, to whom he is loyal and who are loyal to him. He gets to feel a part of something bigger and more powerful than his own insignificant self. He gets status within the gang that he could never have outside it, which attracts girls and makes him look tough to other guys. To reflect these factors, all gangs have the trappings of an intiate group; they must maintain rituals, know codes and undergo intiations.

Using the following guidelines, the gamemaster should develop the concept for a gang before the players create their gang characters.

- **Gang Focus** The gang focus is the reason why this group of individuals got together. Because gang members are all like-minded individuals, the gang focus is usually narrow and frequently based on hatred of something or someone. The most common gangs are those in which the members are all one race: trolls, elves, humans and so on. The flip side is almost as common-multi-racial gangs whose focus is mutual hatred of one race in particular. If a gang's focus is to unite all the neighborhood trolls, then obviously all of the gang members will be trolls. If a gang's focus is hatred of trolls, people of any race aside from trolls can join. A gang's focus might also be to fight a megacorp whose activities or products have been killing "our kind": these types of gangs are especially common in Oakland, California Free State. Gangs like this will accept recruits of any race who pledge to help bring down "the enemy.". Still other gangs are generally anti-corp, anti-government, and so on.
    
- **Initation Rituals** These rituals can be anything that a ganger must undergo to become a member. The ritual can include personal pain, a particular mission, hazing, tattooing or scarring and so on, and usually also involves an oath or vow. The initiation ritual to become a lieutenant may be different than the ritual to become a member; the ritual might change with a gang's leader, or a new leader might require the gang members to renew their vow or oath to show loyalty to him or her. Upon successfully completing the ritual, a new recruit is considered a full-fledged member of the gang.
    
- **Uniforms** Known commonly as colors, gang uniforms can be anything from red bandannas and red socks to the complete uniform of the New York Yankees baseball team circa 1918. Everything from a particular piece of clothing worn to a type of weapon used may be part or all of the uniform. Uniforms let people know exactly what gang a gang member belongs to, and gangers consider it dishonorable to remove their colors for any reason.
    
- **Symbol** A gang's symbol is used to mark their territory: gangers may also wear the symbol as a tattoo or a logo on their jackets.
    
- **Territory** Territory is the gang's home turf, its boundaries usually marked by their symbol. Any given gang's turf is usually in one area of a city and is patrolled by the gang members. Patrols are especially likely if a gang shares a border with an enemy gang. Territory is a gang's ego reflected: members of other gangs are rarely allowed to cross a rival's territory, though a gang's turf may include limited "free" or "safe" zones such as the local street doc's clinic or a school. A good rule of thumb for determining the size of a gang's territory is to make it a number of city blocks equal to the number of gang members (including NPCs). Keeping within that limit should make it possible for the gang to patrol its turf.
    
- **Operations** Operations are the gang's main cash cow (or cows). The gangers may be front men for the yakuza, roughing up businesses that don't pay their protection money on time. Or they may run their own protection racket. They may sell BTLs, smuggle contraband, strip cars, or anything else likely to earn them money to live on and to finance their particular war.
    
- **Uniqueness** Each gang has a unique style; maybe they only fight with katanas, or maybe they're all orks. Go-gangs are a unique type of street gang because they only ride cycles; one of the more unique go-gangs is the one that only deals in highway robbery between Seattle and Portland. They rarely kill anyone and always take the customs papers for the border. Other gangs are known for the type of shadow businesses they take on, as well as how they perform that business. Names, pets, main squeezes, hobbies and fighting tactics may all define a gang's uniqueness. The only limits are the players' imaginations and the gamemaster's approval.
    

### CHARACTER CREATION

No gang character may start with more than 90,000 nuyen. If you are using the priority system of character creation, that means the character cannot make resources Priority A or B. Depending on the gang's make-up, a character's race may or may not matter.

All gangs have Enemies, most of them other gangs. To find out how many gangs are Enemies for the player characters, the gamemaster should divide the number of gang member player characters by 2 (round fractions up). (The bigger you are, the more people want to take you down, right?). For gamemastering purposes, treat all rival gangs as Rank 2 Enemies. Each player character will also have an individual Rank 1 Enemy: a member of a rival gang, a squatter, a BTL dealer, a prostitute or other street person whom the ganger has slotted off, a corporate wage slave that he has inadvertently (or intentionally) hurt, even a member of his own gang who dislikes him because of some past slight. These Enemies will often prefer to humiliate the character rather than kill him outright.

If a player purchases Gang Background for 50 percent of his character's starting nuyen, then that character is the gang leader at the beginning of the campaign. If more than one player wants his character to be leader, the one who spends the highest percentage of his or her starting income on Gang Background wins the honor. If a player cannot roleplay a charismatic leader, don't expect the other player characters to be willing to listen to him. NPCs may stay loyal for a little longer, but they won't stick by a complete frag-off either. Gangs are nothing if not disorganized, and a leader who can't keep his followers' loyalty won't last very long (see Leadership Battle, p. 124). The rest of the player characters are lieutenants, to differentiate them from NPCs and regular gangers. Because of his or her position of power, the leader gets a a second Rank 1 Enemy. (It's tough at the top.).

The gang as a whole gets a single Fixer Contact at Level 1. This contact is established when the gang is created, and does not count as an individual contact. The fixer fences the gang's booty (if any; see Special Rules, p. 123).

Gang members usually aren't a well-educated bunch. Many have not completed high school and extremely few have gone to college. To reflect this, no ganger can have starting Knowledge, Technical or Magical Skill ratings above 3, including Sorcery, Conjuring. Magical Theory. Demolitions and Computer skills. In addition, the Edges of High School Education, College Education and Technical School are all double the standard cost. The point of a ganger campaign is to have fun without being the best at anything.

Gangers tend to have less money than other types of characters and they don't know very many people with money. This means they can't always get their hands on what they want, even when they have the nuyen. To reflect this, gangers cannot have any starting gear with an Availability higher than 5.

When creating a gang, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 per the rules for Gangs/Tribesmen (p. 44, SRII). Gang members created this way are NPCs that the gamemaster may allow the players to control. These gangers belong to the entire group, not to any individual gang member or leader, and do not count as contacts for character creation. All gangers are assumed to know others in their gang; aside from that, ganger characters get the normal number of Contacts or Buddies per standard rules. Gangers are not likely to have non-Street contacts; if they do, there should be an interesting story behind the friendship. For more information on generating a gang, see Gang Creation, p. 121.

Because most gangs lack resources and funds, they rarely boast mages among their number. Cyberware is also a relative rarity, though the less expensive stuff trickles down to the back streets. Deckers are the rarest characters in a gang because of the cost of equipment and most gangers' lack of training and cyberware. Many a gang member sports a datajack, but actual Matrix access is uncommon. Riggers, by contrast, are common. Taking vehicles and borrowing parts to jury-rig faster or more powerful vehicles are all a part of life for many gangs.

- **Gang Options** The character creation rules above apply to the "typical" street gang: by using a few variations, the gamemaster can create several other gang types.
    

The basic concept behind an all-elf gang might be a bunch of bored rich kids convinced of their own superiority. Unlike other gangs, they aren't fighting for their lives; instead, they're out to destroy their "inferiors.". They would have more money and prestige than a regular street gang; characters can have up to 400,000 nuyen (Priority B to Resources) as starting money. Mages are more common in all-elf gangs than in regular gangs, and the members are generally better educated. On the other hand, elf gangs have twice as many Enemies as a regular gang, and must maintain at least a Medium Lifestyle.

The tribesmen gang is not the usual urban gang; this type of gang operates between cities or on very localized turf. Tribesmen are almost always human Native Americans: metahuman members must also be from NAN lands or have Native American blood. The tribesmen follow the standard rules for street gangs, except that one character-usually the leader-must be a shaman. Whether or not the shaman is the leader, his or her totem will be part of the gang's symbol. Deckers and riggers are scarce in tribesmen groups. Only the leader will have City or Street contacts; all other contacts should be Rural or Tribal.

The decker gang is a specialized type of gang whose leader must start the game with 1,000,000 nuyen (Priority A to Resources). The 50-percent Gang Background fee buys the leader not only his position, but also pays for random jackpoints that he has set up in at least 10 locations (determined by the gamemaster and the player running the leader character) and two hidden micronics shops. The Gang Background/Leadership fee in this case serves as a recruitment tool. Decker gangers have no cash or education limits, though only the leader should have any Street contacts. The rest of the gangers have contacts via the Matrix. The gamemaster determines if a given Matrix contact is the real deal or a Matrix poser.

### ADVENTURE IDEAS

Gang campaigns operate on a different scale than shadowruns; they usually boil down to helping your own gang, hurting a rival gang, or internal power plays. Because gangs function In many ways like miniature crime families, most gang campaigns should use the Karma and the Amoral Campaign rules (p. 78). Gangs run small smuggling and theft rings, protection rackets, BTL deals, even prostitution rackets. The point of playing a gang is to fight the gang's Enemies, and in order to do that the gang needs nuyen to equip themselves for their ongoing war. The economics of the gang's operations is determined by the gamemaster, but keep in mind that the average small-time street gang usually acts as middlemen (see Special Rules, below).

Gang wars are the bread and butter of a gang's existence. Gang wars can run the gamut from bragging and posturing to fist and knife fights to blazing firefights and all-out destruction. Many gang wars are one-on-one battles; for the character being "called out" in this way, even a knife fight can be as intense and suspenseful as a war. Gang rivalries are also dynamic; an exciting mini-campaign might involve the characters needing to make peace with a rival gang, and having to convince both sides to sit down and do it.

Ganger campaigns can often be humorous; gangers can be putzes. Without money or training, they aren't going to be good at much, and the kindest thing the gamemaster can do is to keep the opposition at a manageable level. The point of the game is fun, so if the players come up with an in-character creative solution, give it to them even if it's not quite plausible. Gang campaigns can make a nice break from other campaigns or other games. The weight of the world is not on the characters' shoulders in this type of campaign; they shouldn't feel much pressure to do things right, and no matter how dumb, clumsy or inept they are, they know that others are worse.

If you want to showcase the dark side of the streets of the future and the bleak life of the poor, a gang campaign is perfect for that, too. Gang characters have nothing; they have to watch their friends and family suffer without much power to help them. Most NPCs treat them like dirt, and when they try to earn some money shadowrunning, people take it as confirmation that they are nothing but worthless killers.

### CAMPAIGNING WITH GANGS

The following section complements the Archetypal Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.

- **The Premise** The characters are all part of an urban gang or tribe trying to survive and prosper in the Barrens or similar abandoned areas of the metroplex. They must deal with all the challenges of the mean streets, but have few resources to call upon. Any major metroplex can serve as the setting for a gang campaign, with different settings offering different atmospheres and story opportunities. Choose a setting with which the gamemaster and the players are comfortable; most of the campaign's stories will take place there and so the gamemaster needs to generate a large amount of detailed information about the setting.The characters' turf should be especially well-defined. Many of the campaign's stories will have a personal tone because they deal with small-scale events.
    
- **The Goal** The gang is family and tribe, and so loyalty to one's fellow gang members is the most important quality. Never show weakness in front of another gang. Answer all challenges to your gang's turf and honor. Never cooperate with "the man" or anyone else in authority from outside your gang. Oh, and survive until tomorrow. Simple, eh?.
    
- **Opposition** Major antagonists for a gang campaign are other gangs who want to cut into the characters' turf and squeeze them out. Conflicts between various gangs in the campaign can also be influenced by corporate interests working behind the scenes for their own purposes. The hardware and resources available to shadowrunners rarely fall into the hands of a bunch of scroffy gangers. Therefore, conflict between gangs and the fight for day-to-day survival in the urban jungle offer plenty of opportunities for violent conflict, as much to get money and gear as for any other reason. Gang violence often erupts in large-scale combats between two gangs, but can also show up in small-scale brawls and challenges between individual gangers. Finding ways to solve problems without violence can be posed as an interesting challenge to characters in this type of campaign.
    
- **Complications** The restrictions on power may prove frustrating to some players; also, constantly tending to the needs of the gang may take over the campaign and leave no room for other types of stories.
    

### SPECIAL RULES

The rules below answer some major questions and offer strategies for dealing with some of the problems that may arise when running a gang campign.

- **Earning Money** Shadowrun is usually a do-the-job-get-paid world. In a gang campaign, however, characters aren't working for Mr. Johnson, so there usually isn't any pay for their efforts. Gangers do what they do for pride, honor and the amount of pain they can inflict on those they hate. That said, gang members must still earn cash to live and improve their lot in life. Therefore, gangs usually run a money-making operation of some sort-nothing big, but enough to keep them flush.
    

Most gangs get their cash by acting as middlemen in smalltime criminal deals-say. BTL dealing or selling illegal weapons. A simple way to figure rates of pay for this work is to assume that the gang pays 10 to 60 percent of an illegal item's price and then sells it for the prices listed in various Shadowrun products. For example, a gang selling BTL chips at approximately 50 nuyen apiece might purchase them for 25 nuyen from their fixer; this nets the gang a 25-nuyen profit per chip. As always, the gamemaster can simulate the randomness of real-world economics by basing the percentage that the gangers pay on a D6 roll. The gamemaster can also add or deduct an extra 5 or 10 percent, depending on whether or not the gang won its last turf war or completed its most recent mission.

Gangs can also make money by stealing vehicles. Assuming they don't steal the vehicle to use (which saves them money because they don't have to buy one), they can sell it or strip it. If they keep it, they can do anything they want with it-repaint it, smash it into buildings, live out of it, whatever. If they decide to sell it, they can net up to 50 percent of the listed price. If the characters decide to strip the vehicle and sell the individual parts, they will get the full price for the vehicle as listed, but cannot collect until a number of days equal to the total of the vehicle's Body and Armor ratings has passed.

The Sploches steal a Mitsubishi Nightsky out of a parking lot near Dante's Inferno. They weigh their options. They can keep the kick-butt car and use it against the Zero Hours, with whom the Sploches are at war. But the Sploches need nuyen. If they sell the car whole, they can (maybe) get 125.000 nuyen-enough to keep the gang in arms, BTLs and synthehol for a long time. If they strip it, they can get the entire 250.000-nuyen purchase price, but the cred would take 8 days to arrive (Body 5 + Armor 3 = 8). The Sploches can't be sure the Zero Hours won't attack in those 8 days, so they decide to sell the car (after a couple of hits on a cash register or two on the way back to their home turf).

- **Reputation and Leadership** Essentially, a gang's leader is the gang. The leader is the glue that keeps the gang together, and the leader's rep is the gang's rep. The leader of a gang relies on a combination of fear, reputation and honor to retain his authority, rather than the standard Leadership skill. To determine a gang leader's (and therefore the gang's) Reputation Rating, use the standard Reputation rules (p. 199. SRII), but use the character's total Karma Points. In addition to representing the target number for people outside his gang to know of him or her, the Reputation Rating reflects how loyal the other gang members will be in a leadership battle (see below).
    
- **Leadership Battle** Gangs get involved in infighting more often than gang wars. Invariably, a gang member will challenge the leader for control of the gang in a one-on-one battle. Rules for a leadership battle are determined by the gamemaster and the player or players controlling the character or characters making the challenge. The fight can be unarmed combat, a "one knife, two fighters" combat, an old-fashioned duel or any other known or imaginary version of single combat. The battle and the results can be humorous or a bloodbath. The fight can be to the death or to humiliation (which many gangers consider far worse). The winner becomes (or remains) the gang leader.
    

In a leadership battle between the leaders of two gangs or the leader of a gang and an outsider trying to take control of an established gang, one "contestant" may have a higher Leadership Rating than the other. For each 2 additional points of Leadership Rating of the higher-rated opponent, that opponent subtracts 1 from all tests made during the leadership battle. The winning gang gets the losing gang's assets and turf. At that point, each member of the losing gang makes an Intelligence Test against the result of the new leader's Reputation Rating minus his or her (the new leader's) Charisma. (Subtracting the leader's Charisma represents his or her efforts to sway the gang members into following his or her leadership.). Those whose tests fail will walk away, either forming their own gang to exact revenge against the leader or becoming that character's personal Enemies.

Red, the leader of the Ladies from Hades, decides to take on Goldy, the leader of the Medusas. Red wins. Red's Reputation is 15 and her Charisma is 6, and so the nine surviving Medusas each make an Intelligence Test against a Target Number 9 (15 - 6 = 9). Five of the Medusas make successful tests. The remaining four take off, to form a new gang or seek revenge.

- **Gang Creation on the Fly** When a group forms a gang, the opposition is usually another gang. To create an entire gang out of whole cloth, the gamemaster should use the Creating Prime Runners rules (p. 84). The gamemaster should also make sure that the rival gang's numbers match those of the player-character gang, or at least come close. No matter how tough its members, a smaller gang will always lose to a larger one in the long run, and so the gamemaster should aim for a roughly equal balance of forces. Gangs have one of four possible ratings: Inferior, Equal, Superior or Superhuman. There are no Ultimate gangs. All gangs follow the standard rules for ganger NPC statistics.
    

If an Inferior gang has double the numbers of the player characters' gang, they are considered Equal for the purposes of Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. An Inferior gang should have fewer lieutenants than the player characters' gang.

If an Equal gang is twice as large as the player characters gang, consider them Superior for purposes of Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. If an Equal gang has less than half the numbers of the player characters' gang, treat them as Inferior for determining Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. An Equal gang should have the same number of lieutenants as the player characters' gang.

If a Superior gang has double the numbers of the player characters' gang, they are considered Superhuman for purposes of Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. If such a gang has less than half the player-character gang's numbers, consider them Equal for determining Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. A Superior gang should have more lieutenants than the player characters' gang: the exact number is up to the gamemaster.

A Superhuman gang follows the standard rules for NPC statistics, but usually wins its battles no matter how much smaller they are than the player characters' gang. The Superhuman gang has at least twice as many lieutenants as the player characters' gang.

A Superhuman or Superior gang may have divisions in any of the less powerful classifications. For example, the gamemaster may decide that the Inferior gang you just destroyed is actually a division of a Superhuman gang that was looking to move into the player characters' turf. The player characters just made a powerful gang leader very, very unhappy.

As with player-character gangs, the size of the turf should determine the size of the gang. The minimum number of gangers is one per city block; there is no maximum.

---

**THE HALLOWEENERS**
* **Gang Focus**: This gang started as a small group of humans out to rob the rich folk of downtown Seattle of their cred and trinkets. Renraku Security eventually decided that enough was enough; they sent operatives to follow the Halloweeners and their then-leader, Funky Errak, to the gang's hideout. The ensuing gun battle left the hideout in flames and most of the original Halloweeners dead. Only the current leader (known as Slash and Burn) and two other founding members survived. Slash has decided that all megacorps will pay for Renraku's crime, and has opened the ranks of the Halloweeners to anyone willing to take on the corps. This gang has a reputation as one of the most psychotic in the sprawl.
* **Leader**: Slash and Burn, human. An incredibly skinny freak, he likes to burn those who oppose his gang.
* **Lieutenants**: 5.
    * **Zazz**: a human mage and an original Halloweener who survived along with Slash. Zazz still suffers nightmares about fire and has a mental block against using any kind of fire spell.
    * **Zany Janey**: a human razorgirl and another original member. She just loves to cut people—the more blood the better. Janey is Slash's girl.
    * **Honest Jack**: a dwarf. He rescued Zazz, Slash, and Janey from the fire, which also destroyed his home. He became the first new member of the Halloweeners, and he wants every corper dead. He loves to shoot guns.
    * **Sister Love**: a female elf and a rigger. Sister is Zazz's main squeeze.
    * **Bobby Blue**: a troll. He likes to hit people—any people.
* **Gang Rating**: Superior.
* **Head Count**: Approximately 25-40 members.
* **Initiation Rituals**: The Halloweeners use two rituals. The first is the Circle of Fire, in which the gangers build a fire around the recruit. The recruit remains in the middle of the fiery circle for about as long as Slash remembers being in the burning building during the Renraku attack (approximately 5 to 10 minutes). The second ritual is to break into a megacorporate office and bring something back as proof.
* **Uniforms**: The colors of the Halloweeners are orange and black, befitting their name. Most often they wear black clothing, with orange bandannas tied to their arms, legs or neck. They dress up to commit their crimes and almost always wear masks. Ever since the fire, Slash prefers to wear a big ape head when having his fun. Zazz favors a hellhound mask that looks freakishly real in the lights of the downtown arcologies.
* **Symbol**: Originally a pumpkin with an evil leer, the gang's symbol has evolved to the now-familiar vague representation of a pumpkin (usually a circle with eyes and mouth) smiling demonically against a fiery background. The eyes and mouth seem to be coming out of the fire.
* **Territory**: The Halloweeners consider all of downtown and every arcology their turf (that's where they fight their never-ending war, after all). Their headquarters is just outside the downtown area, in the docks south of the Renraku Arcology. They control and patrol the docks up to and including the ones behind the Renraku Arcology, plus the entire area west to the river (including half of Kobe Terrace Park) up to the border of downtown.
* **Operations**: The Halloweeners make their nuyen in straight crime sprees. Most of what they sell goes to the Triads or the Seoulpa Rings.
* **Foes**: The Halloweeners rarely fight other gangs. They prefer to concentrate on their main enemies: Renraku security forces, Lone Star and (surprisingly enough) the yakuza and the Mafia. The Halloweeners will steal from anyone they think looks corporate enough, and the yaks and the Mob fit that bill. The Halloweeners sometimes run into trouble with other gangs because they tend to ignore turf borders. Several gangs in the downtown area and south of downtown Seattle have fought with the Halloweeners at various times.
* **Uniqueness**: Aside from Slash's weird fire fetish, the Halloweeners have no specific modus operandi. They attack those they perceive to be corporate wage slaves, make the occasional hit on the Renraku docks, and every once in a while pull a run on Renraku or some other downtown corp. Their crimes tend to be brutal: multiple deaths, plenty of property damage, fires and so on. The Halloweeners like to set fires. From fear of their bloodthirsty reputation, no one hits them very hard or for very long. Certainly no one wants to be on Slash's hit list.

---

**THE SPIDERS**
* **Gang Focus**: More than anything else, this multi-racial gang is characterized by its members' implacable hatred of bug spirits. This loathing is personal and visceral. Every one of the original Spiders fell into the hands of the Universal Brotherhood at some point in his or her life, and none of them have gotten over the horrors they experienced. Living to destroy bugs, in the company of a like-minded "family," is their way of dealing with these traumas. Their links with the Spider totem, which each gang member meets as part of his or her initiation ritual, reinforces this fiercely anti-bug mindset. The gang is extremely violent, but keeps a relatively low profile nonetheless. Unlike other violent gangs, they never leave "calling cards" or other clues to their presence. Like the spiders they emulate, these gangers prefer to strike silently as well as lethally. They recruit new members by snatching likely prospects off the Seattle streets and brainwashing them into joining the gang over the course of several days. Their methods are brutal and effective: most prospective recruits become true believers in short order.
* **Leader**: Widow, a human Spider shaman. She wears black all the time, to set off her pale skin and gray eyes. She could be anywhere from 20 to 35 years old—no one can tell for sure. She is incredibly vain about her hands, which are long and narrow and extremely graceful.
* **Lieutenants**: 5.
    * **Tarantula**: a young ork recently promoted after singlehandedly killing two roach spirits with a jerry-built contraption that she refers to as "my Raid can". Barely out of her teens, Tarantula is Widow's protégé; the gang leader treats her almost like a daughter. Tarantula repays this regard with fanatical loyalty, Imitating everything Widow says or does.
    * **Fiddler**: an elf and founding member of the gang. Skinny and undernourished, with piercing black eyes, Fiddler is a city-dweller down to his toenails; he claims he can't breathe if he goes too far away from the concrete jungle. His arms are covered with puckered scars, about which he refuses to speak.
    * **Trapdoor**: a dwarf. He hates wasp spirits above all other bugs, though he'll gladly kill any bugs he can get his hands on. Trapdoor plays incessantly with a cat's cradle, and can make more shapes with it than anyone alive ever knew existed.
    * **Wolf**: a human who escaped from the Chicago Containment Zone just a year ago. He is convinced that his Spider totem led him to Seattle, the one place on Earth where he could hope to find people capable of "casting out" the fly spirit that he believes was attempting to possess him. The Spiders picked him up in the Redmond Barrens within weeks of his arrival in Seattle, sized him up as a potentially powerful magician, and made him their own in record time. Wolf believes that Widow is divinely appointed to rid the world of bugs, and that she will ascend into Heaven on spider-silk wings when her task is finished.
    * **Recluse**: a troll and Fiddler's squeeze. She rarely talks to anyone except Fiddler, and even to him rarely uses more than two or three words at a time. She's deadly with almost any kind of blade, but is especially partial to a jagged-edged hunting knife that she's named "Sweeney". Somewhere, Recluse picked up detailed knowledge of anatomy (though she doesn't remember where anymore), and so she supervises the bulk of the gang's organlegging activity.
* **Gang Rating**: Superior.
* **Head Count**: Approximately 50-100 members.
* **Initiation Rituals**: Each prospective recruit goes on a vision quest to meet Spider and receive his or her gang name (always the name of a spider). Those who survive this ordeal become gang members; those who don't generally die raving with a day or two of the quest's end. Once a new ganger receives a name, he or she is assigned a specific task as part of "guarding the Web". In practice, this usually means a specific building to protect, area to patrol, or other job to do that somehow relates to keeping the gang's territory bug-free. More experienced gangers explain carefully to each newbie exactly what their assigned task is, how best to do it, and why it's important in the Scheme of Things. After proving themselves by fulfilling their assigned tasks well, new gangers move on to Part 2 of their initiation—kidnapping a potential initiate. They usually also take part in the brainwashing of their victim, sometimes even assuming the leading role. Once they accomplish this, they are eligible to become lieutenants. To become a lieutenant, a ganger must kill a bug spirit singlehandedly. The ganger in question seeks out a nest of bugs and informs at least five fellow gangers of his or her intent to kill one. These witnesses accompany the gang member to ground zero, where they watch the ganger attempt to kill the bug. They do not intervene unless their fellow ganger looks likely to lose the fight, in which case they will jump into combat to save the ganger's life. The ganger does not become a lieutenant, however, and must spend at least a year living down the disgrace before being permitted to try again.
* **Uniforms**: The Spiders wear synthleather jackets in the gang's colors: black or dark brown and red. Most often, black or dark brown is the background color, with a red design on the jacket in synthleather, embroidery, paint or (occasionally) colored tape.
* **Symbol**: Each Spider makes (or finds) his or her own variation on a web—anything from the classic spiderweb to a butterfly net to a schematic representation of a Matrix network. These symbols may be painted or embroidered on jackets, worn as shoulder patches or jewelry, tattooed on the ganger's body, or anything else the ganger desires. All gang members wear web tattoos on their shaved scalps.
* **Territory**: The Spiders claim all of Redmond as their territory, which they refer to as "the Web". According to rumor, their headquarters is an abandoned warehouse in a particularly godforsaken section of Redmond known as Brain Heaven.
* **Operations**: To finance their bug-hunting expeditions and pay for their living expenses, the Spiders most often serve as couriers, fences and other types of criminal middlemen. They also frequently resort to petty theft. The most lucrative of their activities is organ-legging, as they have a steady supply of failed recruits to carve up for spare parts.
* **Foes**: The gang considers bug spirits of all types as its primary foes, and will go out of its way to assault bugs or anyone the gang perceives as being somehow "in league" with the bugs. (This definition can be fairly loose, depending on who's making the call) . The Spiders also have occasional run-ins with other gangs in Redmond, generally when another gang "refuses to accept the Spiders' protection from the evil bug spirits".
* **Uniqueness**: The Spiders pride themselves on acting like their namesakes—moving silently and striking so swiftly that the "enemy" is immobilized or dead before he knows what hit him. They mark their territory with signs rather than patrols; an intruder into Spider turf will suddenly find himself surrounded by gangers who seemingly materialized from thin air, and will shortly afterward be unconscious or a corpse. This "guerrilla warfare" approach has made the Spiders a force to be reckoned with, against bug spirits and in more ordinary criminal activities. Spider couriers have a reputation for being able to deliver the goods in record time; Spider fences are known for webs of contacts so dazzlingly vast that most attempts to trace the sale of illegal goods back to the gang end in failure.

---

**THE SPIKES**
* **Gang Focus**: Once a run-of-the-mill go-gang, the Spikes (formerly the Spike Wheels) have recently come under the leadership of a charismatic troll named Lord Torgo. Torgo became the gang boss after singlehandedly destroying one of its major rivals, the Silent Ps; after the victory, he changed the gang's name to reflect its improved status. Always anti-elf, the gang has stepped up its operations against Tir Tairngire under Torgo's control.
* **Leader**: Lord Torgo, a troll of awe-inspiring dimensions with a bloodthirsty streak to match his size. Though as poorly educated as any other lifelong resident of Seattle's slums, he is fantastically intelligent, and reads everything he can get his mitts on. His favorite books—actual paper books with battered covers and dog-eared pages—are Sun Tzu's **The Art of War** and Machaivelli's **The Prince**. Though no one dares mock him for his interest in reading (though many consider it a waste of time and energy better devoted to survival), the information contained in his best-loved books allowed him to dispatch the Silent Ps in the spectacularly messy and unquestionably personal manner that solidified his fearsome reputation throughout Seattle.
* **Lieutenants**: 2.
    * **Goddess Ursula**: an enormous female troll and Torgo's main squeeze. She can barely write her own name, but has an instinct for fighting tactics that won her Torgo's respect. She loves to ride at full speed toward large armored trucks, firing away with an Uzi in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other.
    * **Manny One-eye**: only half Torgo's size but fanatically loyal to him. Manny has not a brain in his head, and is so hideous that his appearance alone will intimidate almost any enemy. He claims to have lost his eye in a brawl with a Tir Ghost patrol, of which he was the only survivor. Current rumor among the Spikes says he actually lost it in a poker game with the gang's previous leader, and that Torgo won it back for him. Torgo is said to keep the eye in a lock-box under a floorboard in the gang's HQ.
* **Gang Rating**: Superior.
* **Head Count**: Approximately 15-25 members.
* **Initiation Rituals**: To join the Spikes, a prospective recruit must kill an elf. He can accomplish this any way he wishes, but must have at least two witnesses to the killing and must bring back a "trophy" for Lord Torgo to put on display. Favorite trophies are ears and scalps—the latter especially if the victim had hair of an unusual color.
* **Uniforms**: All gang members wear camo fatigues, in keeping with Lord Torgo's conceit that the gang is actually a disciplined private army. Gang members also wear gold bandannas, most often tied around their heads or upper arms.
* **Symbol**: Usually spray-painted on the sides of vehicles they've trashed, the Spikes' symbol is a crudely drawn elf head with Xes for eyes; the head is pierced by a spike, which frequently (though not always) has blood dripping from it.
* **Territory**: The Spikes claim Interstate 5 and the neighborhoods surrounding it, from just south of downtown Seattle all the way to the Tir Tairngire border—this area includes Fort Lewis, Puyallup and Hell's Kitchen. Their HQ is rumored to be in Fort Lewis, though no one knows exactly where.
* **Operations**: As the "tollkeepers" of Interstate 5, the Spikes are perfectly placed to indulge in their favorite activity—attacking anything and anyone going into or coming out of Tir Tairngire. Any vehicle on the road is fair game, but favorite targets include shipments of goods with potentially high value in Seattle's shadows. In addition to (literal) highway robbery, the Spikes are known for particularly vicious hate crimes against elves.
* **Foes**: Lord Torgo's personal ambition is to destroy the Ancients, Seattle's best-known elf gang. He and his fellow gangers love to use Tir border patrols as target practice. As the gang's primary enemies are elves, they rarely bother ork or human or dwarf gangs unless provoked.
* **Uniqueness**: One of the few all-troll gangs in the Seattle sprawl, the Spikes are known for their unorthodox mode of attacking their chosen targets. Like the ancient Mongol hordes who galloped across the steppes of Central Asia, the Spikes ride down their victims en masse; the sight of a posse of troll bikers thundering toward a truck or armored car, howling all the way, has given more than one driver heart failure.

---

**THE RED HOT NUKES**
* **Gang Focus**: The Red Hot Nukes prefer to think of themselves as a neighborhood association rather than a gang, despite their clearly illegal activities. They regard their primary mission as protecting and aiding residents of their neighborhood any way they can. Though membership is only open to dwarfs, the Nukes display no prejudice against other races; they will defend their people against any threat, and define "their people" as being everyone who lives on their turf.
* **Leader**: Grinder, a young black dwarf and ex-runner with an anarchist bent. Grinder is a physical adept, and is personally training every member of the Nukes to be as talented a physad as he is. On the rare occasions when Grinder gets tipsy, he hints at his deep dark reason for founding and training the gang—he claims to have discovered some horrible future event while on an anti-megacorp run a few years ago, which he is grooming the Nukes to prevent. He refuses to tell anyone exactly what this future is; the mere mention of it gives him nightmares.
* **Lieutenants**: None.
* **Gang Rating**: Equal.
* **Head Count**: Approximately 15-25 members.
* **Initiation Rituals**: Each new recruit must prove himself by disarming a bomb built by Grinder. Those who fail this test are blown to smithereens.
* **Uniforms**: The Red Hot Nukes wear gray and red, and each of them sports a baseball-style cap.
* **Symbol**: The gang's insignia is a mushroom cloud, which commemorates both their name and their skill with explosives. The symbol appears somewhere on every ganger's clothing, often painted on their jackets or worn as a patch on the jacket or cap.
* **Territory**: The Nukes claim Redmond as their turf; their headquarters is in the Hollywood neighborhood.
* **Operations**: The Nukes specialize in jobs that require expertise with explosives. In addition to demolitions, they build small bombs for use in protection rackets and insurance scams; local businessmen who need ready cash frequently call on the Nukes to destroy their businesses so that they can then pocket the insurance money. Part of every ganger's training involves bomb-building with a wide variety of materials: the Nukes go out of their way to avoid "signature" bomb-making styles so that law enforcement can't trace explosive devices back to them. The gang also pulls the occasional theft, or even wetwork if the price is right.
* **Foes**: Perhaps reflecting their leader's ex-runner background, the Nukes are anti-corporate to the point of paranoia. Though they do most of their demolition work for pay, they carry out a certain number of sabotage runs against corporate research installations, the more obscure the better. They regard most of the other gangs in Redmond as "enemies of the people," and fight them when they must; however, they don't go looking for trouble. The Spiders and the Rusty Stilettos are the most frequent targets of punitive action by the Nukes, as they are more likely than other gangs to challenge the Nukes' authority.
* **Uniqueness**: As far as anyone knows, the Red Hot Nukes are the only gang composed entirely of dwarf physical adepts. They're also the only ones who specialize in bomb-making to the virtual exclusion of anything other moneymaking activities.

---

**THE NIGHT HUNTERS**
* **Gang Focus**: The skinheads of the 2050s, this human-only gang and its various like-named splinter groups live to hassle and intimidate metahumans. Unlike their twentieth-century counterparts, the Night Hunters don't discriminate based on skin color or gender: only metahumans are the targets of their hatred. They lean toward the Humanis policlub party line, and proudly act as front-line thugs in the policlub's war "to make the world safe for true humanity". They are often violent, but actually kill their victims far less often than most people believe. Most gang members are well under thirty: many of them are heavily into body-piercing and chains.
* **Leader**: Stiv (main group: the various splinter gangs have their own leaders). Stiv grew up in a respectable middle-class home, ruled by his father's iron hand. Father was a preacher of the fire-and-brimstone variety, and as the oldest child Stiv got the lion's share of harsh paternal attention. He is a classic sociopath—highly Intelligent and completely lacking in empathy or conscience. When under extreme stress, he burns himself with cigarettes as a way of proving himself impervious to pain.
* **Lieutenants**: 2 (main group; splinter gangs vary).
    * **Splitter**: a stocky half-Amerind woman with vicious knife scars on her cheek and throat. She claims to have gotten the scars on the Night of Rage, when a rampaging band of trolls broke into her home and murdered the rest of her family. The trolls left her for dead, but she managed to drag herself to the household PANICBUTTON and call DocWagon. Orphaned and homeless, she survived as best she could on the streets of Seattle until the Night Hunters took her in when she was ten years old. She has never tried to challenge Stiv's authority: she considers it a waste of time as long as there are metahumans around to hurt.
    * **Shank**: a skinny mulatto of nineteen who has been Stiv's right-hand man for the past five years. Shank hails most recently from Redding in Northern CalFree, and has an especial loathing of elves (though other metas aren't much better, to his way of thinking). Abandoned by his mother at a young age, Shank doesn't know who his father is; lately, though, he's been fantasizing that Daddy is really Kenneth Brackhaven. Shank would never presume on the relationship, however; he merely wants to admire his "father" from afar. Right now, the Night Hunters are all the family he needs.
* **Gang Rating**: Equal.
* **Head Count**: Approximately 20-30 members.
* **Initiation Rituals**: Each new recruit must brand a metahuman with the Night Hunters' symbol. Some Hunter gangs will accept painting the symbol on a metahuman's skin, but most gangs prefer more painful methods. The favorites are burning (like cattle branding) and carving the symbol about a quarter-inch into the skin with a rusty knife. Particularly sadistic gangers follow up the second method by sprinkling salt into the cuts.
* **Uniforms**: Night Hunters favor head-to-toe black leather ornamented with chains and studs. All of them, male and female, wear their hair in mohawks dyed bright green. Every Night Hunter sports three hand razors on one hand, which they use to make their distinctive slashing mark.
* **Symbol**: A talon slashing the moon. They wear the symbol most often on clothing or as a scalp tattoo. Many of the gang members like to draw the symbol on their jackets in glow-in-the-dark paint: that way, their intended victims can see them coming and feel the appropriate terror.
* **Territory**: The Hunters claim all of Renton, but lack enough members to patrol the area. Countless splinter gangs exist, all but one of whom continue to call themselves the Night Hunters: the single exception is the group known as the Werewolves, which split from the main band of Hunters three or four years ago and has managed to share the gang's turf relatively peacefully.
* **Operations**: The Night Hunters trade in BTLs for money: aside from that, they commit whatever crime seems like it might be the most fun way to kill a slow afternoon. They are partial to vandalism—there's nothing most Night Hunters like better than making lots of noise and smashing things, especially if they can terrorize some metahumans in the process. They rarely kill their metahuman victims: for most Hunters, the thrill is in humiliation and torture. A corpse doesn't cringe or beg for mercy, and so is no fun any more.
* **Foes**: The primary foe of all Night Hunter gangs is the entire metahuman population of Seattle. From the high-level elf corporator to the ork janitor down the street, all metas are equally fair game (though they prefer the very old and the very young as the easiest to intimidate). Other Night Hunter groups, formed when one lieutenant or another tried and failed to unseat Stiv, are hostile to the main gang (and to each other). Each splinter group sees itself as the "true" Night Hunters to a greater or lesser degree: the various groups act out this belief by assaulting each other or else refusing to acknowledge each other's existence. On occasion, one Night Hunter gang declares a holy war against another; these wars invariably fizzle out after the first couple of casualties, however.
* **Uniqueness**: More than any other human-only gang, the Night Hunters are obsessed with humiliating metahumans. If a ganger's day goes by without his at least being able to spit on an elf or trip up a troll, that day has been an utter waste of time. Night Hunters love to collect trophies from their metahuman victims, especially elf ears, troll and ork tusks, and dwarf beards (complete with the layer of skin that used to cover the unlucky dwarf's chin). The gangs' distinctive triple arrangement of hand razors is highly unusual.
