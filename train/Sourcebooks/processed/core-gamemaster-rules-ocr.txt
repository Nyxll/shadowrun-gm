# BEHIND THE SCENES
"Never relax. Your run might be over, but someone, somewhere, is just starting his, and the target could be you." -Kirk Hoff, street mage

This section is primarily the domain of the gamemaster, though players will also find it helpful to read. As with all the Shadowrun rules, these are primarily guidelines. If players and the gamemaster do not agree with the working of a particular rule, or more important, how it feels, they are free to change it. No one is going to come by their house late one night to find out if they are playing by the published rules. We stopped doing that years ago.

## DICEY SITUATIONS
As an adventure unfolds, players are going to want to use the skills and Attributes of their characters to get things done: con their way past a guard, fix a broken detonator before the trolls find their hiding place, or try to understand what that corp-type who speaks only Japanese is saying to them. The gamemaster, meanwhile, will want to know whether the player characters saw that all-important clue or whether they inadvertently kicked it under the trash.

For many of these situations, gamemasters will have to rely on their own judgment to decide which skills are needed for the situation, to determine the target numbers and situation modifiers, and to interpret what a "success" means. The following guidelines and rules will help resolve some of the more common situations.

## USING SOCIAL SKILLS
To influence a non-player character (NPC) through Social Skills, the player character uses a mental statistic of the NPC as the base target number. If he or she is attempting to influence a group of NPCs who have no designated leader, use the average of their ratings. Groups tend to react as a whole, the reluctant members being drawn along by the enthusiastic ones. Otherwise, simply make all attempts against the leader of the pack (varooom).

The base target number is modified by circumstances according to the Social Skill Modifiers Table, below.

Social Skills offer a prime opportunity to use extra successes as a measure of accomplishment. Judge the exact effects according to the specific circumstance.

---

## SOCIAL SKILL TABLE
| Situation | Target Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| **With respect to the character, the NPC is:** | |
| Friendly | -2 |
| Neutral | +0 |
| Hostile | +4 |
| An enemy | +6 |
| Suspicious | +2 |
| **Player's desired result is:** | |
| Advantageous to NPC | -2 |
| Of no value to NPC | +0 |
| Annoying to NPC | +2 |
| Harmful to NPC | +4 |
| Disastrous to NPC | +6 |

> Dodger wants to do some snooping at a local Mitsuhama subsidiary. To get in, the elf tries, with a little fast talk and a somewhat tattered ID card, to negotiate his way past the gate guard. Dodger has a Negotiation Skill Rating of 4. The elf uses the other chummer's Mental Attribute as his target number, in this case, the guard's Intelligence of 3. The guard is suspicious (+2, it's his job to be suspicious) and will be in trouble if he allows unauthorized personnel into the compound (harmful to him, +4), but the elf's got an ID card (the gamemaster awards a special -1 for supporting evidence). That brings the target number to 3 + 2 + 4 - 1, or 8.
>
> Because of Dodger's Negotiation Skill of 4, he rolls 4 dice and gets 6, 6, 6, and 4 (lucky pixie). The elf's got a good line tonight. He re-rolls the three sixes and gets 2, 3, and 5. Adding each result to 6, he gets a final result of 8, 9, and 11, for a total of 3 successes. One would be enough to get him past the guard, temporarily convincing the poor fool that Dodger really is a Mitsuhama employee. That wouldn't last long, though, because the guard is no idiot. Unless distracted, he would begin to notice holes in the elf's story. Because Dodger has 3 successes, the guard is convinced enough to wait until the end of his shift before checking his log book to see whether the ID was valid (and because it wasn't, setting off alarms). If the elf had been skillful enough to get 5 successes, the guard might never have twigged to the deception and might not even have logged in Dodger's presence.

**RACISM AND CHARISMA**
Charisma is the gut-reaction Attribute. It influences an NPC's reaction to a character before any words are spoken or actions taken. It is a reaction that comes with a character's first glance across a crowded room, out on the street, or in a dark alley.

Before a character can interact with an NPC, the gamemaster must determine whether or not the NPC is racist. To find out, roll 2D6 and subtract 6. If the result is a positive number, then yes, the NPC is racist. The number itself determines how racist the NPC is, in effect creating **Racism Points**. (A roll of 9 gives a result of 3, meaning the NPC has 3 Racism Points). Next, determine where the NPC's bias lies. Roll 1D6 and consult the following table.

---

## RACISM TABLE
| Dice Result | Racial Bias |
| :--- | :--- |
| 1 | All, except own race |
| 2 | Humans |
| 3 | Elves |
| 4 | Dwarfs |
| 5 | Orks |
| 6 | Trolls |

---

If the result is the NPC's own race, ignore that result and continue to roll 2D6 until two racial biases are indicated, or the result is all races.

An NPC with Racism of 3 against orks would have that listed as Racism (Orks) +3 in the Notes section of the Character Record Sheet.

This information modifies the interaction numbers between a character and an NPC in the following manner. When making a Social Skill Test, as described in the previous section, add any Racism Points the NPC harbors against the character's racial type to the Social Skill target number. The character can offset these points by making a Charisma Test against a target number (known only to the gamemaster) equal to twice the NPC's racism. Each success generated counteracts 1 point of racism. Successes from this test do not directly help the Social Skill Test; they are only used to offset Racism Points.

If the character is defaulting to Charisma for the Social Skill Test, he may not make a separate Charisma Test to offset racism.

## USING BUILD/REPAIR SKILLS
Characters performing a Build or Repair task are primarily interested in how long it takes. A very successful character can reduce that time. Divide the time specified for the operation by the number of successes achieved to determine the total time required.

As a guideline to the time required to build things, find the price of a comparable item on the Equipment Table, p. 254, and divide that figure by one of the following numbers to get the typical time in hours. Divide by 10 for armed-combat type items, by 20 for vehicles, and by 50 for electronics, cyberware, or other technical gear. Ordinary, everyday equipment would have a Target Number 4. Fancy or technical stuff gets a 6. The real exotics start at 8.

The following skills and skill groupings have corresponding Build/Repair Skills or are Build/Repair Skills themselves: Aircraft, Armed Combat, Biotech, Boats, Computer, Demolition, Electronics, Firearms, Ground Vehicles, Gunnery, Projectile Weapons, Throwing Weapons.

---

## BUILD/REPAIR TABLE
| Situation | Target Number |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Working Conditions:** | |
| Bad | +2 |
| Terrible | +4 |
| Superior | -1 |
| **Tools are:** | |
| Unavailable | Usually not allowed |
| Inadequate | +2 |
| Reference material available | 0 |
| Working from memory | +(5 - Intelligence) |

> Dodger's sweating hard, but he can't feel it under the water from the sprinkler system as he fumbles with the soldering iron and probes (inadequate tools, +2) he scrounged up. He wishes Grinder hadn't blasted the door lock to keep the corp cops from coming through it behind them. The runners need to go through it now, before the whole place blows up in their faces. Between the sprinkler system and the stress, the gamemaster decides that Dodger is working in terrible conditions, and the water from the sprinklers splashing on the circuits does not help one bit (+4). To override a door control without a lock would normally be a typical task (Target Number 4). Dodger faces a Target Number of 4 + 2 + 4, or 10. He has Electronic Skill of 4, and so he rolls 4 die for this test. The results are a 3, 4, 5, and 6. The re-rolled 6 yields a 5, for a total of 11, and Dodger breathes a sigh of relief.

## VEHICLE OPERATION SKILL
Normal vehicle operation does not require any dice rolls. Unless things are really bad, most people can safely operate a vehicle for which they are trained without any problems. Unfortunately, shadowrunners are not most people. They ask their vehicles to do things that would make the most hardened driver's ed teacher drop dead. When those situations come up, the gamemaster can use the Handling Rating of the vehicle as a target number and apply the following situation modifiers.

These modifiers apply only to non-combat situations.

---

## VEHICLE OPERATION TABLE
| Situation | Target Number Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Complex controls | +1 |
| Unfamiliar vehicle | |
| Nonstressful situation | +1 |
| Stressful situation | +3 |
| Large vehicle of type | +2 |
| Very large vehicle of type | +3 |
| Bad conditions | +2 |
| Terrible conditions | +4 |
| Rigger in control | -(VCR Level Ã— 2) |

> Whiz Kid's a rigger. He's also into aircraft, helos to be exact. He's got Rotor Skill of 6. Being a rigger, he has concentrated on Remote Operation and specialized in Fixed-rotor. He can operate any fixed-rotor aircraft, remotely or jacked in, at a rating of 8.
>
> Whiz Kid's Ares Dragon has hit a sudden squall and he decides to land before it gets worse. The chopper is big (+2) and the squall makes for bad conditions (+2). With his Vehicle Control Rig Rating of 1 he gets a -2. Too bad he's never flown a Dragon before (+1), but least he's not under fire. His target number is the Dragon's Handling Rating of 5, plus the modifiers, for a final Target Number of 8. Whiz Kid rolls a 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6, and 6. Re-rolling the three sixes, he gets 1, 1, and 4, for a final result of 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7, and 10. The last 1 saves his butt because it gives him one success. The Dragon sets down safely.

## USING KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
Does the player know the capital of Tir Tairngire? What about the metals that make up orichalcum? What are the normal operating parameters of a smartlink and why does this chipped ork, who the player just offed, have something that seems to work differently? Players may not know this information, but their characters might. Below is a list of suggested target numbers and a Success Table for using the various Knowledge Skills.

---

## KNOWLEDGE SKILL TABLE
| Situation | Target Number |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Character is seeking:** | |
| General knowledge | 3 |
| Detailed knowledge | 5 |
| Intricate knowledge | 8 |
| Obscure knowledge | 12 |
| **Number of Successes** | **Result** |
| 1 | General knowledge, no details |
| 2 | Detailed information, with some minor points inaccurate |
| 3 | Detailed information, with some minor points obscure or missing |
| 4+ | Detailed and accurate information |

> Fastjack has never had much use for magic, but he knows science (Physical Sciences Skill 6). He got his hands on a strange, white rock and he wants to know what it is. The gamemaster, who knows that the object is a piece of metamorphosed flesh, secretly sets the Target Number at 12 because the rock is not natural and because magical workings are not common knowledge, especially to Fastjack. Fastjack rolls his dice and manages to get 2 successes, which is not enough to learn the whole story. The gamemaster informs Jack that his analysis tells him that the rock is a metamorphic carbonate of unusual structure, possibly a fossil, because of the presence of some apparently biological structures.

---

## USING LANGUAGE SKILLS
When using languages, failure to achieve the required number of successes usually means that the attempted communication was only partially successful, and possibly misunderstood, to the character's detriment. The gamemaster may want to make any required die rolls himself, so that the players will not know whether or not what they intended to say got across.

---

## LANGUAGE SKILLS TABLE
| Situation | Target Number |
| :--- | :--- |
| Speaking dialect (variation of a particular language) | +2 |
| Universal concept (hunger, fear, bodily functions) | 2 |
| Basic conversation (concerns of daily life) | 4 |
| Complex subject (special/limited interest topics) | 6 |
| Intricate subject (almost any technical subject) | 9 |
| Obscure subject (deeply technical/rare knowledge) | 11 |

> A beautiful elven woman comes running up to Dodger, babbling something in Elvish. His knowledge of the language is minimal (Elvish 2). He rolls his 2 dice and gets two sixes. As it turns out, these are successes, and so he understands that she is looking for help because someone is following her (Complex Subject, Target Number 6). When she tries to explain just who it is and why they want her (Intricate Subject, Target Number 8), the convolutions become too much for Dodger (he rolls a 2 and a 5) and he loses the sense of what she is saying. Still, she is a maiden in distress, and he must help her!

---

## USING EQUIPMENT
As listed in the Equipment Table, p. 254, most Shadowrun equipment carries a rating, but the ratings are generally unimportant. The equipment does what it does, unless some other piece of equipment opposes it. A good example of this action-counteraction is a radio transmitter and a jammer. As long as the radio transmission is unopposed, it works fine and no tests are necessary. If a jammer is also being operated, the equipment must also make a test to see whether it overcomes the transmitter. Each piece of equipment uses its own rating for the number of dice to roll, and the rating of the opposing piece of equipment as the target number. Ties have no result; the device that was activated first remains active. This equipment rating is the item's **ECM/ECCM** (electronic countermeasures/electronic counter-countermeasures) Rating.

Equipment that does not normally have such a rating (like cyberware radios) can be upgraded to include rating points of ECM/ECCM. Simply multiply the list cost by the ECM/ECCM Rating installed. Use this rating for any tests the gamemaster must make for the equipment.

Equipment listed with a base cost in nuyen are assumed to have an ECM/ECCM Rating of 1. If the purchaser wishes to acquire the piece of equipment at Rating 0 (no ECM/ECCM, and opposing equipment automatically dominates), then multiply the base cost by .75.

Items acquired at a higher than ECM/ECCM Rating 1 add that value to the Availability of the item (see below).

**Availability**
Availability determines how easy it is to acquire a particular item, and how long it takes to do so. Associated with Availability is the **Street Index**, which affects the price of the item if purchased through the shadow or gray markets.

Both numbers are intended as guidelines for the gamemaster, who should make adjustments to these values based on the particular campaign and the specifics of the situation.

When a character wishes to purchase something that is legal and generally available, he can do so, unless the gamemaster has some reason for wishing to limit access to that item. Some legal items have Availability Codes that reflect their limited supply but that do not necessarily imply that these items must be purchased through "other means."

To obtain the desired item, the character contacts the source, usually a fixer, though this may vary (a Mr. Johnson, for instance, might have access to a piece of relevant technology). For this **Acquisition Test**, the gamemaster rolls a number of dice equal to either the source's relevant Special Skill (such as the fixer contact's "Equipment Acquisition" Skill) or the standard Etiquette Skill (Street, Corporate, and so on), adding +2, against the first value of the Availability Code, which serves as the target number. For certain items, especially those with a variable rating, the gamemaster may wish to increase the Acquisition target number by 1 for every 2 rating points of the item.

Divide the resulting number of successes from this roll into the base time it takes to obtain the item, which is the second part of the Availability Code (to the right of the slash). This part of the code appears in hours ("hrs") days, and months ("mths"). The base time divided by the number of successes achieved provides the actual time it takes for the source to locate the item. Halfway through this period, the source actually finds out that the item is available and contacts the buyer. If the gamemaster (the source) rolls no successes, the item is not available at this time.

When the source contacts the buyer, a **Negotiation Test** should be made. The character rolls his Negotiation Skill dice (or Charisma or related Skill Web default) against a target number equal to the source's Willpower Rating. The source does the same, using the character's Willpower Rating as its target number. The price of the item is equal to the Cost multiplied by the Street Index. Whoever generates the most successes (source or buyer) may adjust the price in their favor by 5 percent for every success they rolled above the opposition's success total.

If the buyer cannot, or will not, pay the resulting price, the deal is off. If the buyer agrees to pay, the item shows up at the time indicated and a meet is arranged to exchange the item for the money.

If a piece of equipment with an ECM/ECCM Rating greater than 1 is being purchased, the Availability of that item should be increased appropriately, and the Street Index increased by .1 per rating point.

## HAULING THE LOAD
Players have a tendency to equip their characters with every conceivable item, from assualt cannons to toasters, along with enough ammunition and bread to keep them operating continuously for five years. If the players' equipment seems to be getting a bit out of hand, the gamemaster can impose the following **Encumbrance** rules.

A character can carry up to his Strength x 5 in kilograms without appreciable effect.

Twice that load (Strength x 10 kg) will leave the character in a state equivalent to Lightly Wounded on the Stun Condition Monitor (see p. 111).

A character carrying three times the load (Strength x 15 kg) is Moderately fatigued, cannot run, and his movement is cut in half.

Four times the load (Strength x 20 kg) makes the character Seriously fatigued, he cannot run, and his movement is cut to one-quarter the normal rate. Any heavier load makes the character pass out from exertion.

If the character is only trying to lift a load, but not carry it, he may add (Strength)D6 kilograms to his maximum load (Strength x 20 kg). A character can only hold this weight for a number of turns equal to his Body, however. Any longer increases the character's Stun Condition Level by one level per turn.

## PERCEPTION
The gamemaster usually keeps the player informed of obvious information about the character's surroundings. But what about the not-so-obvious information? Like whether or not that corp-type suit over there is packing heat. Or whether the character can hear that sneaky elf coming up the alley behind him. Or smell the chromed ork hiding under an invisibility spell.

To determine what a character is aware of in such situations, the gamemaster tests the character's **perception**. He uses the character's Intelligence Rating for the number of dice to roll; the target number will depend on the circumstances.

An individual making a Perception Test should roll the dice as described above. The gamemaster may want to make one Perception Test for the entire team, but this should not be done when surprise is possible (as described on p. 86 of Combat). For a group Perception Test, find the average Intelligence Rating for the team and roll that many dice plus an additional die for each member of the team.

A Perception Test can be made for any situation that involves one of the five senses; sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. Set the base Target Number at 4 and use the Perception Test Modifiers Table to determine appropriate modifiers. The table is not meant to cover every situation, but merely to offer some guidelines.

Some things, like the Concealability of guns, have specific numbers assigned to them, as listed in the Equipment Table in the Gear section of the rules, p. 254. The Perception Test should be made against that number.

A single success indicates that someone has noticed something. Consult the Perception Success Table to determine other levels of success.

## PERCEPTION TEST MODIFIERS TABLE
| Situation | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Perceiver is distracted | +2 |

| 4+ | The perceiver knows what it is, but has no specifics without further information or examination. |

## DISEASES AND TOXINS
Toxins (drugs and poisons) and diseases can do damage from which a character may recover normally. Many also have side effects that affect the character as long as the nasty stuff is active. As the disease or toxin runs its course through the character's body, some of these side effects may only manifest at certain stages. Countermeasures to toxins and diseases are called **antidotes**. These will increase the victim's dice by their rating for the Body Test if no damage has yet been done. If the patient has gone down (Deadly Damage Level) from the effects of a nasty, the injection of the correct antidote counts as professional attention. See Deadly Wounds and First Aid, p. 115.

Many **vaccines** can be administered before a character is exposed to a disease or drug. These provide immunity to the toxin, and so the character is not required to resist the damage at all.

Diseases and toxins are rated for the damage they do and the speed with which they take effect.

The **speed factor** determines how soon after exposure the victim will have to resist damage. For toxins, this is usually immediately, but the time period can be hours or even days for diseases. The victim must use a Body Test to resist again if that time period elapses again and he is still in contact with the toxin, or still infected by the disease. Some kind of technological or medical attention must be given during this period.

The description of the disease or toxin will specify any side effects or symptoms and include notes about how the nasty stuff gets into the victim's system and any special treatments that might be necessary.

To resist diseases and toxins requires making a Body Test using the Power of the attack as the target number. Every 2 successes reduces the Damage Level.

**Toxins**
* **Neuro-stun VIII**
    * Damage: 6S Stun
    * Speed: 1 turn
    * Description: Delivered as a gas in an organic binder, N-S VIII takes effect if inhaled, or on contact with the skin. At the end of the turn during which a character is exposed to N-S VIII, he suffers Stun damage. Even if he resists this, he suffers disorientation for about an hour, adding +2 to all target numbers.
* **Narcoject**
    * Damage: 6D Stun
    * Speed: Instantaneous
    * Description: Injected. Can be used in drug darts, because a touch is sufficient to inject. No side effects.
* **Fugu-5**
    * Damage: 3D
    * Speed: Instantaneous
    * Description: Injected or eaten. This is a hyped-up version of one of the deadliest neurotoxins in nature. No side effects if the character resists.

**Diseases**
* **VITAS-3**
    * Damage: 6D
    * Speed: 12 hours
    * Description: Aerosol virus transmitted by close contact or by infected person sharing a confined space with another person. After the incubation period, fever, chills, and vomiting occur until damage is reduced to Light.

---

## NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS
The gamemaster can use the various archetypes and contacts provided in this book for the **non-player characters (NPCs)** with whom the player characters interact during the course of the game. Often, the game statistics presented for the archetype or contact will work as published and require no modification. Most times, however, the stats will need modification to better suit the particular character or situation.

The system provided for creating a character, p. 40, is not the best way to generate an appropriate NPC. That system is designed to create starting player characters, not non-player characters of varying experience levels. The main difference is that NPCs need not be balanced to anything beyond the gamemaster's needs for the story. The attributes, skills, abilities, and gear of the NPC should be tailored to the story, not to a creation system.

If a gamemaster would like to use a system to create experienced NPCs, the following formula may be helpful: Use the character creation system provided, but for every two years of experience the NPC has, increase the Attribute, Skill, or Resource values by 10 percent. For non-player characters that have been around the block more than a few times (in the biz longer than 10 years), increase the values by 10 percent for every 4 years beyond 10. The appropriate values of a character in the business for 25 years would increase by 50 percent for the first 10 years, and then another 30 percent for the next 15 years (not quite 16 years, so not 40 percent), for a cumulative 80 percent increase.

Another way to create experienced, or, perhaps more appropriately, more dangerous NPCs is to use **Threat Ratings**.

**THREAT RATINGS**
Threat Ratings are a simple way to increase an NPC's toughness without going through extensive character-creation back-flips. Each point of Threat Rating gives the NPC an extra die for any tests, offensive or defensive. Threat Rating dice are not the same as a Dice Pool; Threat dice are always available and need not refresh. A number of dice equal to the Threat Rating is available for multiple tests within a Combat Phase. If using Threat Ratings, do not use standard Dice Pools for that non-player character.

No clear-cut way exists to determine the amount of Threat Rating an NPC should have, as Shadowrun offers no easy means to determine the relative toughness of characters. The two possible angles of attack are:
1.  Base the Threat Rating on the Skill Success Table, p. 68 of the Skills. Use the adjective in the first column (Difficulty) to describe the NPC's "threat level," then use the target number from the second column as the Threat Rating.
2.  Give the NPC a Threat Rating related to the team's total Team Karma (see Karma, p. 190), at a ratio of 1 point of Threat Rating per 100 Karma points earned, for example.

Each gamemaster will probably need to experiment to find the most effective way to assign Threat Ratings.

The Threat Rating is not added to Initiative dice for the purpose of determining the NPC's Initiative. Use the standard Reaction plus Initiative dice formula.

Threat Rating dice should be treated as Combat Pool dice for determining a clean miss. See Combat Pool, p. 84.

**NPC ACTIONS**
Non-player characters are rated by their professionalism and how well their courage holds up under fire. NPCs can be rated as **Average, Semi-Trained, Trained**, and **Professional**. The NPC's **Professionalism Rating** determines how long after he is injured a character will remain in a fight. The gamemaster should take the NPC's level of professionalism into consideration when that character gets into a fight, but should never feel constrained by it.

* **Average Non-Player Characters (Rating 1)**
    Average NPCs are untrained and unfamiliar with combat situations. They tend to react poorly, slowly, and without a plan. Examples of non-player character types with a Professionalism Rating of Average are pedestrians, wage slaves, and so on.
    Average NPCs will withdraw from a fight or else stop fighting immediately after they receive a Light wound. The gamemaster may choose to make a Willpower (4) Test for the character to determine whether or not he is able to steel his will and remain in the fight.
* **Semi-Trained Non-Player Characters (Rating 2)**
    Semi-trained characters have some training and/or combat experience. They will remain in a fight until the situation is obviously no longer going their way. They tend to act in a deliberate manner and with a plan, but do not have the cool head of the true professional. Some examples of character types with a Professionalism Rating of Trained are street cops, low-ranking corporate security guards, and the like.
    Semi-trained characters will withdraw from a fight or else stop fighting immediately after they receive a Moderate wound. The gamemaster may choose to make a Willpower (4) Test to determine whether or not the character is able to steel his will and remain in the fight.
* **Trained Non-Player Characters (Rating 3)**
    Trained characters have received special combat training and, in general, know what they are doing. They are not stupid and will not take foolish chances. Some examples of character types with a Professionalism Rating of Trained are bodyguards, mercenaries, ranking or experienced street cops, corporate security guards, and so on.
    Trained characters will withdraw from a fight or else stop fighting immediately after they receive a Serious wound. The gamemaster may choose to make a Willpower (4) Test to determine whether or not the character is able to steel his will and remain in the fight.
* **Professional Non-Player Characters (Rating 4)**
    Professional non-player characters live for combat. They will remain in a fight till the bitter end, or until personal motivation dictates otherwise. Examples of character types with a Professional Rating are any shadowrunner, elite law enforcement or security characters, or important non-player characters (gamemaster judgment).

## FENCING THE LOOT
A character's got an optical chip full of hot data, fresh off some corp's database. As an added bonus, the character nailed some exec's limo, and has the ordnance from half a squad of bodyguards in the trunk. How does he get rid of it all?

If the team has a prearranged deal for disposing of loot, then ignore these rules. If they have a pile of stuff and nowhere to sell it, then it's time to find a fence. The fence could easily be one of their regular street contacts, like a fixer or a talismonger, depending on what the runners have to sell.

**FINDING A FENCE**
Finding a fence requires a successful Etiquette (Street) Test. The base Target Number is 4, modified per the situations on the Finding a Fence Table.

---

## FINDING A FENCE TABLE
| Situation | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Using a regular contact | -1 |
| Disposing of standard gear | -1 |
| Disposing of hi-tech or other important loot | +1 |
| Disposing of hot loot | +3 |
| While being sought by police | +1 |
| While being sought by a corp or organized crime | +2 |
| Magical loot (foci, spell formulae, and so on) | +2 |

---

**THE LOOT**
Most fences will buy loot that is easy to dispose of before taking on the fancy stuff. A fence typically prefers to buy in the following order:
* Standard gear, including weapons, clothing, armor, vehicles, jewelry, credit balances (money), and so forth.
* Hi-tech loot, including ordinary data, equipment, research files, and such.
* Hot loot, including unique items, specific datafiles, prototypes, procedurals for new processes, magical items, or anything that belonged to a big, big boy and is irreplaceable.

If a team is working together to find a fence, roll a number of dice equal to the average Etiquette (Street) Rating for the group looking for the fence plus 1 die for each member against the modified target number (determined by adding or subtracting the situation modifier from the Finding a Fence Table to the base Target Number of 4). All the characters who contribute their Etiquette (Street) Rating to the total must attend the meeting at which the loot will be sold. If one or more of them cannot show, the fence will get nervous and skip the meet.

Successes achieved on the roll to find a fence can be used in two ways.

* **Hustle It Along**
    It takes a base time of 10 days to locate a fence and set up a meet. Characters may allocate successes to reduce this time (to a minimum of 1 day). Each day spent looking for a fence increases the chances that the former owners of the merchandise will learn that the player characters are trying to move it. At the end of each day, the gamemaster rolls a number of dice equal to the days spent searching against a Target Number of 6. Even 1 success means the bad guys are on to them. If the gamemaster thinks the bad guys would hunt down the team, he can set up an ambush at the meet.
* **Financing the Fence**
    Fences have limited means; they are just ordinary businessmen, trying to turn a dishonest nuyen. Instead of using their successes to reduce the time required to find a fence, the team can allocate successes to increase the fence's bankroll. The gamemaster secretly rolls 2 dice and multiplies the result by 100,000Â¥ to determine the base bankroll. He then multiplies the base amount by the number of successes the team allocates to the fence's bankroll to get the total amount of money the fence will have available for their meet. Of course, this total does not represent the amount of money the fence is going to spend, just how much he has available.

**THE MEET**
A meet can take place anywhere. Once the meet is in progress, make a Negotiation Test between any one character and the fence. Roll a number of dice equal to each opponent's Negotiation Skill, using the other's Willpower Rating as the target number. Naturally, both sides are suspicious of the other, adding an automatic +2 modifier to the target number. The gamemaster sets the ratings for the fence.

The base price for any loot is 30 percent of its actual value, as listed in the Equipment Table, p. 254. For other loot, the gamemaster sets the prices.

Whichever side wins the Negotiation Test alters the price paid by 5 percent per extra success. If the fence won, the percentage paid will not drop below 10 percent. If the team won, the percentage of the actual cost paid will not rise above 50 percent.

The fence will almost certainly bring enough muscle along to forestall any unscrupulous business practices the team may consider. If the original owners of the loot are coming after it, they will show up at the meet as well.

## LIFESTYLES OF THE RICH AND SHADOWY
Even though it may sometimes seem that many Shadowrun characters live in a bar, that is not so. Each character has a unique lifestyle, and the following information can be used to flesh out events that might occur in his life in between adventures. Most important is the effect a character's lifestyle has on healing, described at the end of the Combat chapter, p. 113.

**Lifestyle** measures the quality of the character's daily life and his or her living expenses, including shelter, food, entertainment, clothing, and so on. It does not cover technical resources, weapons, magical equipment, professional hirelings, or other major impersonal items. The player and the gamemaster can also make other decisions about interesting details of the character's lifestyle. Almost infinite variations are available. For example, a character might live in an abandoned building, but install enough conveniences to qualify as having a Luxury lifestyle. Keeping all those gadgets running, buying security, maintaining water supplies, and keeping a low profile will cost as much as a mansion in a ritzy neighborhood.

A character living a Middle lifestyle or higher can support guests at a rate of 10 percent above his own cost of living per guest. A host can also keep a guest at a lower lifestyle than his own by paying 10 percent of the lower cost of the guest's lifestyle. Servants are often maintained in this manner.

**LUXURY**
This lifestyle offers the best of everything: spacious, ritzy digs, lots of hi-tech toys, the best food, drink, and you-name-it. The character has a household staff or a maid service or gadgets to do the mundane chores. He has a powerful car, maybe even a hot sports model or a chauffeured limo. Whether it's a big house, a snazzy condo, or the penthouse in a top hotel, this is the life for the high-stakes winners in the business: top executives, government big shots, high-level yakuza, and the shadowrunners who pull off the big scores.
* Cost: 100,000Â¥ a month and up-up-up!

**HIGH**
A High lifestyle offers a roomy house or condo, good food, and the tech that makes life easy. So what if the character does not have the same perks as the big boys, but neither does he have as many people gunning for him. His home is in a secure zone or protected by some good solid bribes to the local police contractor and gang boss. There is a housekeeping service or enough tech to take care of most chores. A luxury commuter car is at his beck and call. This is the life for the well-to-do on either side of the law: mid-level managers, senior yakuza, and the like.
* Cost: 10,000Â¥ a month

**MIDDLE**
The Middle lifestyle is not the best of everything, but is far from the worst. It offers a nice house or condo with lots of comforts. So characters eat some nutrisoy as well as natural food, but at least the autocook has a full suite of flavor faucets. Characters also have a commuter car or first-class tube pass. This is the lifestyle of ordinary successful wage-earners or criminals.
* Cost: 5,000Â¥ a month

**LOW**
With this lifestyle, the character has an apartment, and nobody is likely to bother him much if he keeps the door bolted. Meals are regular. The nutrisoy may not taste great, but at least it's hot. And power and water are available during their area's assigned rationing periods. When those of the Low lifestyle travel, they ride the tube. Factory workers, petty crooks, and other folks stuck in a rut, just starting out, or kind of down on their luck tend to show up here.
* Cost: 1,000Â¥ a month

**SQUATTER**
Life stinks and most of the time, so does the character. He eats low-grade nutrisoy and yeast, adding the flavors with an eyedropper. His home is a made-over building, converted into barracks, divided into closet-sized rooms, or maybe he just rents out a coffin-sized sleep tank by the night. The only thing worse than the Squatter lifestyle is living out on the streets.
* Cost: 100Â¥ a month

**STREETS**
The character lives on the streets! Or in the sewers, steam tunnels, condemned buildings, or whatever flop he or she finds for the night. Food is where he finds it, bathing is a thing of the past, and the only security is what he creates for himself. The bottom of the ladder, inhabited by down-and-outers of all stripes.
* Cost: Hey, chummer. Life ain't all bad: it's free.

**HOSPITALIZED**
This is a special lifestyle, applicable only when a character is sick or injured. The character is confined to a hospital, be it a real one, a clinic equipped as a hospital, or a private location with the necessary equipment installed. Characters cannot own this lifestyle. They only pay for it until they get well or go broke, whichever comes first.
* Cost: 500Â¥ a day for basic care. 1,000Â¥ a day for intensive care.

**KEEPING UP THE PAYMENTS**
Characters have to shell out the nuyen each month to keep up a lifestyle. If they miss a payment, they may end up in debt and living a lower lifestyle.

Each month that a character misses a payment, roll 1 die. If the result is greater than the number of consecutive months of payments missed, no sweat. The missed payment is absorbed by the character's credit, which is part of the cost of his lifestyle. If he makes the next payment, everything is fine again.

If the die roll result is less than or equal to the number of missed months, the character is in trouble. His lifestyle gets downgraded to the next lower level. This means being evicted from his former home, having some of his tech repossessed, having to hock some clothes, and so on.

The character is also in debt, and owes somebody one month's cost of his former lifestyle. If the character is mostly legit, he's in debt to a credit company. If the character is a criminal or shadow person or now lives a lifestyle lower than Middle, being in debt may mean that he or she has defaulted on less-formal financial obligations. This can lead to earnest discussions with large persons on the subject of debt management. After the character gets out of the hospital, the loan can be paid back. And it had better be paid back. There's always a good market for fresh body parts. "Taking [a debt] out of your hide" takes on a whole new meaning in the year 2053.

**BUYING A LIFESTYLE**
A character can permanently buy a given lifestyle by making a payment equal to 100 months' upkeep. Ten million nuyen buys a permanent life of luxury. This represents investments, trust funds, and so on, that take care of payments. Admittedly, there is not much reason to spend 10,000Â¥ buying a permanent lifestyle as a squatter, though it might be useful if the character wants to maintain a getaway or hideout somewhere.

Nothing in life is certain, however. A character can lose a permanent lifestyle through an enemy's action or through sheer bad luck. A decker can rip investments to shreds, or enemies can simply blow holdings into scrap. These things depend on the way the character's story unfolds, not on how much is on his credstick at the time.

A permanent lifestyle of Middle or better can be sold. If the character has a couple of months to broker a legitimate deal, roll 2 dice. Multiply the result by 10 percent to determine how much of the purchase price the character is paid for the property. If the character is a shadow person, i.e., lacking a SIN, roll only 1 die. Also roll only 1 die if the character has to dump the property fast or through an agent because he is on the run.

## KARMA
In Shadowrun, **Karma** measures the experience characters get when they go out on an adventure. They do not get Karma for doing the laundry, unless the laundromat is in an urban combat zone. Karma is used to improve Attributes, skills, and special resources.

Karma is awarded at the end of an adventure, but not necessarily after a single playing session. The gamemaster decides who gets Karma and how much they get. Every character in a group receives Karma for some things, but some awards go only to individuals.

Each surviving member of a team gets Karma for staying alive, succeeding at a mission, and for the degree of danger in the mission.

Individual characters can pick up additional Karma for good roleplaying, gutsy fighting, smart planning, sheer luck, and other personal feats.

Of the Karma a character gets, 90 percent of it becomes **Good Karma**, which is used over the long term for improving the character. Ten percent goes into the character's **Karma Pool**, which is used in the short term for general butt-saving. A character's Good Karma and Karma Pool are tracked separately. Always round off in favor of Good Karma.

**GOOD KARMA**
Good Karma is used between adventures to improve character ratings or gain benefits. A character can increase Physical and Mental Attributes 1 point by paying a number of Good Karma Points equal to the rating to which the Attribute is being raised. Raising a Strength of 5 to 6 would cost 6 Good Karma Points.

Attribute Ratings cannot normally exceed the character's racial maximum. However, if the gamemaster agrees, paying double the Good Karma Points can raise the Attribute above the racial maximum. For example, a human character who wanted to raise her Strength from 6 to 7 would have to spend 14 Good Karma Points to do so. The gamemaster should probably discourage players from raising a character's Attributes to beyond 1.5 x the racial maximum.

Good Karma can also raise Attributes that have been reduced for some reason. Though it is NEVER possible to use Karma to directly raise Reaction, Essence, and Magic, Reaction may change if Quickness or Intelligence is improved.

**Skills**
Skill Ratings can also be raised using Good Karma. Once the Karma has been paid, the Skill Rating goes up 1 point.

Once the character has begun the game, improvements in general skills, Concentrations, and Specializations all happen separately. Increasing a general skill does not automatically change the Concentration, and so on.

---

## GOOD KARMA COST FOR SKILLS
| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| General skills | 2 x New Rating |
| Concentrations | 1.5 x New Rating |
| Specializations | 1 x New Rating |
| Languages | 1 x New Rating |

> Iris has specialized in Firearms Skill. Her current ratings are Firearms 1, Pistols 3, and Beretta 101T, her chosen weapon, of 5.
> * Raising her general Firearms Skill from 1 to 2 costs 4 Karma Points.
> * Raising her Pistols skill from 3 to 4 costs 6 Karma Points.
> * Raising her Beretta 101T skill from 5 to a Specialization 6 costs 6 Karma Points.

New Concentrations are based on the existing general skill score. If the character has Firearms 4 and wants to concentrate with Pistols at 5, the Concentration would cost 5 x 1.5, or 8 Karma Points.

New Specializations are based on the existing Concentration score. If the character does not have an appropriate Concentration, use the general skill. Thus, if the character only wants to improve with the Remington Roomsweeper, the Specialization would cost 5 x 1, or 5 Karma Points, to reach Rating 5 in that specialized skill.

New skills cost 1 point of Good Karma for the first rating point.

A Hermetic magician must have unrestricted access to a sorcery library with a rating equal to, or greater than, the Sorcery Skill rating he wishes to acquire.

**KARMA POOL**
One-tenth (round up) of all Karma earned goes into the character's Karma Pool. The character can draw from it as needed during an encounter, but once the Karma Pool is emptied, it is no longer available for that encounter. The full value of the Karma Pool returns with the next encounter. (What constitutes an encounter? A single scene or event in the story. It might be a single location or several closely related areas. A running gun-battle might be a single encounter, or it might be a series of them. If the runners have time to catch their breath, it usually means a new scene, or encounter, has begun.)

Points from the Karma Pool can be used a number of ways.

* **Re-rolling Failures**
    A character can use 1 point from the Karma Pool to re-roll any test dice that failed. For example, the player rolls 4 dice and scores 2 successes. For 1 point of Karma, he can roll those 2 failed dice again. This process can be repeated, but each time it is done on a single test the Karma cost goes up by 1, until all the dice are successes or the character runs out of Karma.
* **Avoid an "Oops"**
    The Rule of One can be partially avoided. If all the character's dice come up 1, it usually means a disastrous failure. Paying 1 point of Karma does not allow a re-roll, but does turn the disaster into a simple failure. Additional Karma cannot be spent on the failure.
* **Buy Additional Dice**
    A character may spend 1 point of Karma to buy an additional die for use in a test, up to a maximum of however many skill, Attribute, or rating dice are in use, not including other Pool dice. These karmic dice score, and are used, normally.
* **Buying Successes**
    It is also possible to purchase raw success at a cost of 1 Karma Point per success, but on two hefty conditions. First, the character has to generate at least 1 success normally through the test. No natural, regular successes, no karmic successes. Second, Karma Pool dice spent to buy a success are gone (pffft!) forever, expended permanently. The do not refresh with the pool in the next scene. Replacement Karma must be earned.
* **Adding to the Team Karma Pool**
    A character can permanently transfer points from his Karma Pool to the Team Karma Pool. These points are gone for good, even if the character later leaves the team. (What's a Team Karma Pool? Read on!)

## TEAM KARMA
Just as a character has a Karma Pool, so does a Shadowrun team. Members of the team contribute points from their personal Karma Pools to the **Team Karma Pool**. Points from the Team Karma Pool can then be used exactly like points from a personal Karma Pool, but by any member of the team.

The Team Karma Pool refreshes every scene or encounter, in the same way as a personal Karma Pool. Any points from the Team Karma Pool used to buy successes are permanently lost, just as they are from a character's own Karma Pool.

When a team agrees to become a team, they make a list of the members, and each member must contribute at least 1 point of Karma from his or her own Karma Pool to the Team Karma Pool. Additional points can be added to the Team Karma Pool between scenes or encounters, or between adventures.

Points may not be removed from the Team Karma Pool unless one of the team members chooses to leave the team, or is asked to leave by the other members. In that case, one-half of the current Karma Points are removed from the Team Karma Pool. The departing character does not take these points with him, and if that character ever rejoins the team, he must add new Karma to the Pool. Those lost points do not reappear.

When a new member joins the team, he or she must pay the initial 1 point of Team Karma.

No Team Karma is lost when a team member dies, and a replacement for that character is treated as a new character.

A character can be part of more than one shadowrunning team, but each team that character belongs to subtracts from the value of his Team Karma contributions. The actual value of a Team Karma contribution is equal to the number of Karma Pool points transferred, minus the number of additional teams the character is a part of. If a character is part of two teams, it costs that character 2 Karma Pool points to contribute 1 point of Team Karma to either team.

Points can only be drawn from the Team Karma Pool if a majority of team members agree to do so. All the characters of the team need not be present in a scene or encounter for the Team Karma Pool to be used, but all the players present at the gaming session must still vote. In ties, the gamemaster should cast the deciding vote.

## GAME LETHALITY
Face it, not everyone likes the same thing in a game. One of the biggest points of contention is how lethal a combat system should be, especially for a dark, gritty game like Shadowrun. Some players and gamemasters want a "realistic" system, where any punk with a gun is a threat. Others prefer a combat style like those found in pulp-fiction or action films, where the major criteria of success is the number of rounds fired. Others like it somewhere in the middle.

To that end (and to keep everybody happy) the design of the Shadowrun system allows the gamemaster to adjust combat lethality. As written, the game is pretty deadly. A punk with a gun and decent skill is definitely a threat. Gamemasters and players who like that style should use the rules as written. For a less-lethal game, increase all armor's Ballistic Armor Rating by 50 percent (round up). For an even less lethal system, double the Ballistic Armor Ratings. In all instances, the rating of impact armor should remain the same. The gamemaster can also make other adjustments.

Melee combat, as written, is fairly survivable. To make it more lethal, increase the Power Ratings of the attacks by 50 percent. For really deadly combat, double the calculated Power. (We do not advise this. Who wants to deal with a troll that can hit with a Power of 24+?)

If magic seems too powerful, double the base Drain target number from one-half Force to Force. This adjustment does not make magic any less deadly, but it will give magicians second thoughts about the power of the spells they want to cast. If the magic in the game is really too powerful, then use Force as the base Drain target number, and halve the Spell Resistance target numbers.

Matrix combat can be balanced by adjusting Security Ratings and IC Ratings.

Remember, though, that none of these options is more right than any other-it's all a question of taste. As always, players and gamemasters should agree on any modifications to the rules before beginning play.

## SHADOWRUNNING
The 2050s are an exciting, dangerous time with plenty of opportunity for adventure. And that is where the player characters come in. Whether making a run on some megacorp's mainframe or providing security for a visiting dignitary or busting a friend out of a detention center, they are the heroes. The adventures a gamemaster creates should challenge the players' wits even more than their guns, and he should reward good roleplaying as much or more than lucky dice-rolling.

When getting a group of players together, the gamemaster ought to learn something of their interests or else his adventures are likely to flop. One of the most important matters to consider in planning the mission is to invent one the players would really like to tackle. But don't expect a lot at first. They probably know less about the ways of the game universe than the gamemaster, and may have only vague ideas about what they want to do. They might want to make money, take on a corrupt corp, deal with elves, and so on. Once they get a few runs under their belts and their characters' life stories take some shape, the players' goals and ideas will gradually become more defined. They may want to hunt down a particular enemy, or find a lost love, or take revenge on a corporation that did them dirty, or find a specific teacher or piece of custom gear. The gamemaster can and should build these ideas and suggestions into major themes in his adventures.

Encourage the players to write out their characters' histories, including background on family, friends, and previous employment. The gamemaster can then draw on those histories to develop adventures that get everyone involved.

**Be Aware!**
The gamemaster has to keep a lot in mind. Listen to what the players say. Keep track of the NPCs: their whereabouts, plans, and so on. Keep a note pad handy for jotting down memos as the adventure rolls along.

**Be Knowledgeable!**
A gamemaster needs to be familiar with the whole game. That does not mean memorizing the whole rulebook, but he or she should be familiar enough with it to be able to find a particular rule or rules quickly when needed. The gamemaster should also have a good knowledge of the basic game systems.

Keep a written outline for the adventure handy for quick reference when necessary. Experienced gamemasters usually improvise more, but those just starting out will usually find it best to think through the adventures in advance and to keep them relatively simple.

**Be Fair!**
Stick to the rules. If the gamemaster or players hate something written here, change it. Make sure everyone knows what the new rule is.

Remember that the gamemaster knows much more about what is happening than the NPCs do. The gamemaster may know the player characters' skills, weapons, spells, and so on, but the NPCs do not. It would be unfair to let the NPCs behave and make plans based on that knowledge.

**Be Realistic!**
Remember also that the NPCs played by the gamemaster are people, with fears, needs, hopes, and desires. By giving them life, the stories that come out of the game will be more memorable for everybody involved.

Play critters like real critters, too. For example, most animals have little or no interest in killing for pleasure. They fight out of necessity-to eat, to protect their young, to save their own hides.

**Be Flexible!**
If a player wants to do something not explicitly covered in the rules, don't just refuse on principle. There is always a skill rating of some kind that can be used for a test. Tell the player what skill or Attribute applies to the situation and whether the chances are good, indifferent, or terrible. Don't reveal the precise target numbers, just hint at whether or not the intended action or move is possible.

If a new rule is created to cover a special situation during a game, decide later what to do with it. It might become a new "house rule" that will always apply in future, or a one-shot solution that may or may not be used again. The middle of a shadowrun is no place to discuss the fine points of game mechanics.

**Be Tough!**
Challenge the players. If they don't sweat to get that Karma, they haven't earned it. Two goons armed with baseball bats would not be the only security guarding the corporate data center, and the local yakuza won't keep their main database on a home computer.

Once everyone is comfortable with the way the rules work, it'll be easier to fine-tune the "threat level" of an adventure. For now, keep in mind that on a really rough run, the player characters should, ideally, win it only by the skin of their teeth, if they win at all. But if the gamemaster doesn't get it right at first, nobody's gonna fry him (we hope).

**Be Kind!**
How can a gamemaster be tough and kind? A gamemaster can kill off a character anytime. He can throw enormous risks at the player characters until their luck runs out and they fail a test. But only cheap bullies do that. Gamemasters who measure their success in trashed character sheets soon find themselves without players.

Better to be too easy on the characters than too deadly.

When the player characters get in over their heads, remember that bad guys like to take prisoners. Prisoners can be made to talk. Prisoners can be used as hostages. Prisoners can also pay ransoms. Most important, prisoners have a chance to escape and live to fight another day. If fictional villains were smart enough to kill off the heroes at the first opportunity, then all the adventure movies ever made would end after the first 10 minutes.

## DEATH AND SHADOWRUNNING
In any roleplaying game, death is a touchy subject. Nobody likes it when a favorite character buys the farm. In Shadowrun, agricultural property can come very cheap. Characters can get splattered before they know what is happening. Despite all the special rules and hi-tech medicine, player characters are going to die.

Sometimes, the gamemaster may have to cheat to keep characters alive. If, in the gamemaster's opinion, the player did everything right and just had bad luck in rolling dice, the character does not have to die. Knock the character out! Stick him in the hospital! Whatever! Don't let a well-developed character die just because the player rolled a 2 when the character needed a 3. The gamemaster can and should decide that he stays alive long enough to get to a hospital.

The same goes for the best NPCs. If the villain the gamemaster spent hours designing gets hit by a lucky shot and does not resist the damage, the body can always be buried under a collapsing building or suffer some other disaster that "no one could possibly survive." A few months later, the villain can show up, held together by glue and cyberware, ready for revenge against the player characters.

## CREATING AN ADVENTURE
There are lots of adventures to play and lots of ways to play them. Each of dozens of roleplaying games published has taken a swing at describing how to write a good adventure. There have been hundreds of articles on the subject, too. Experience is the best teacher, but some suggestions and tips for taking care of certain details may help.

The main elements of an adventure usually include **objectives, motivations**, and **opposition**.

**Objectives**
In order to "win" the adventure, characters usually have to survive, for starters. Beyond that, the team has to carry out some specific task: find the lost gizmo, rescue the kidnap victim, pay off a debt, kill or capture the villain, or foil his plan. At first, the real objective(s) may not be obvious. The adventuring team may have believed they were doing a run on a corporate mainframe to get the nuyen to pay off their bookie-until they find a file with the plan to clear out a tribal holding so the corp can build a plant. If it so happens that one of the characters belongs to that tribe, the team gets a new objective: foil the plan.

When writing an adventure, keep track of the objectives and give characters a chance to fulfill them. Let them find clues or be given assignments that reveal objectives. Objectives are worth Karma, so this is important.

**Motivation**
Suppose the gamemaster has an adventure all worked out and sends Mr. Johnson to the team with a job offer that will catapult them into the adventure. After listening to the pitch, the team says, "No thanks, Mr. J. We'll take a big pass on this one."

This may be the time to talk to the players about why they don't want to tackle the adventure. Too dangerous? Too little reward? If the problem is money, push the fees up a little. Some characters might want payment in kind rather than credit: magicians want teachers or supplies, deckers want time on a mainframe to design programs; samurai like access to new hardware, and so on. Everybody likes information, so maybe Mr. Johnson can come up with the passcodes to a certain mainframe, hmmm?

If the whole premise of the adventure bores the players silly, it may be better to simply scrap this session in favor of a bull session on the kinds of things the players want their characters to do.

The more information players give the gamemaster about their characters' lives, beliefs, and psychology, the more material the gamemaster has to build motivation into the adventures. As the players get into the game, characters will acquire friends, enemies, obligations, and quirks. These also can be used to motivate adventurers.

**Opposition**
Most adventures involve some opposition. The team must face and defeat an enemy in order to achieve their objectives. Enemies can be anonymous forces, or they can be very personal. The world of Shadowrun provides a wide array of possible enemies.

Shadowrunners often tackle big organizations. When possible, they do so obliquely, rather than risk getting smeared by standing in the open and challenging the opposition to come out and fight. Big organizations are usually bureaucratic nightmares, riddled with politics and slow to react. Shadowrunners can dance around the giant, stinging it instead of going head-to-head. Often, corporate opposition is actually an individual who runs a piece of the organization, rather than the whole show. If the team defeats that individual, the larger organization will usually throw the guy to the wolves. Organizations rarely try to exact revenge, because revenge shows no gain on a balance sheet.

Opposition can also come from individuals or from small groups more on a level with the team itself. This can get personal very quickly.

A good enemy is a valuable resource in writing future adventures. Depending on how seriously the shadowrunners work him over, such a foe may want to waste the team for no other reason than revenge. Adventures become a series of duels between the player characters and their relentless foe, building up to a final showdown.

The following descriptions of some typical organized foes may be useful.
* **Corporations:** The enormous megacorps of 2053 offer plenty of niches for ruthless individuals willing to use any means necessary to advance their plans, whether it be winning a corporate objective or feathering their own nests. Corps are at least nominally sensitive to public opinion and government oversight; after all, boycotts, lawsuits, and investigations are bad for business. If the characters run up against a corporate executive and trash his illegal plan, the parent company will, more than likely, piously disclaim any knowledge of the criminal's actions.
* **Organized Crime:** Crime is a growth industry in the 2050s. The team, especially if its members are SINless, are themselves members of the underworld. The underworld is also a rich source of enemies. The Big Boys are still around, typified by the yakuza, Japan's equivalent of the Mafia. Tackling any criminal organization can be deadly because such groups can move quickly and decisively. There are power struggles in the underworld that characters can exploit, and the samurai-like code of the underworld can also work to the shadowrunners' advantage. If they play "by the rules" and their opponent does not, their foe's own fellow-criminals may turn on them.
* **Government:** In the chaotic politics of the Sixth World, government can be an enemy or an ally. Governments are big and powerful, but clumsy when trying to swat a mosquito-sized enemy. A typical government enemy is an intelligence organization or a bureaucratic office. If the opposition is operating covertly or illegally, then it can be defeated by exposure, because the government will disclaim all knowledge of these activities and leave the head of the agency to twist slowly in the wind.
* **Police:** The cops can be with you or against you. The typical law enforcement contractors in Shadowrun are stretched thin trying to keep the people they protect from going under in a wave of crime. Widespread corruption often leaves the clean cops powerless. The typical police opposition should be a crooked officer, possibly a precinct commander, whose schemes cross the team's trail. Of course, if the characters are simply a bunch of thugs, preying on the innocent, then every cop in the city will be out for their blood, and rightly so.
* **Policlubs:** Policlubs, or front groups for policlubs, or the hidden masters of policlubs, make good opposition. Stinkers like the Humanis are prime villains. Policlubs are usually riddled with internal politics and extremely sensitive to bad publicity. Unlike the other groups, they don't have crack mercenaries on call, but their people are often fanatics. Typical policlub opposition will be a local chapter or splinter group with an agenda that includes blackmail, assassination, terrorism, and the like.

**Adding Color**
An adventure needs to engage the imagination, which is really what roleplaying is all about. Players need to see the scenery, hear the gunshots, feel the sweat trickling down their necks. Some players will do most of the work. Others will make the gamemaster want to tear his hair out because they refuse to play along. Most will fall in the middle.

As a wise old gamemaster once said, "Don't tell me what is happening, show me!" Good advice. Avoid reciting descriptions in a dull monotone. Overact! Ham it up.

If possible, use some kind of display with miniatures to show players the territory. It's much easier to draw a wall with a door in it than to try and explain the layout verbally. This kind of display also avoids all manner of arguments as to who is standing in the line of fire, where the grenade goes when someone tosses it, and so on.

When the team taps into a datafile containing a fiendish corporate plan, don't just read it to them. Write one up before the adventure and hand it to them. Every such prop speeds up play and adds color.

Make the NPCs as colorful as possible. A lot of gamemasters act in character when playing NPCs, complete with funny voices. Being a ham helps. Steal wholeheartedly from comic books, movies, TV, and fiction. If the gamemaster wants to play a fixer like Groucho Marx, go ahead. If, on the other hand, this kind of play-acting doesn't suit the group, don't bother with it.

Color should not come only from the gamemaster. Players should try to stay in character too. Besides providing players with enemies, loot, and Karma, adventures include subplots to advance the shadowrunners' life stories when they are not in a firefight or decking into the Matrix. Do they have a love life? If not, do they want one? Who are their friends? How do they spend their time? Try and have at least part of each adventure develop these details.

**Prep Time**
This is time the characters will need to get ready for the run (the gamemaster should take some, too). The players will always want to do a lot of preparation before taking on anything they think is tough. They will need to scope the place out, check on the principal opposition's background, look for subordinates to suborn, and such. They can spend a whole session getting ready. Don't let them.

To keep it moving, have some of that info available for them. Pass it on through a contact or their fixer. If they want to double-check or do their own snooping, compress the time. If the decker wants to hunt around, have the player make a single dice roll and use the number of successes to decide how much info he or she finds. If one of the team wants to get friendly with somebody in the target organization, or monitor activities to learn schedules and/or procedures, let the player make one die roll for an appropriate skill or Attribute. Weigh the number of successes rolled and how little time is left before you give them the information that they want to know. Give it some probability of accuracy. ("You're pretty sure the wage slave thinks you're an okay dude." or "They've changed the passcodes at two o'clock for three of the last four days. The other time it was at three o'clock and they had a fire drill that day.") After all, the characters are still guessing at how likely it is that what they've seen or learned represents standard conditions. If they want special gear, let them put the word out. The stuff may or may not be available in the time given them. The gamemaster decides.

In short, give the team a little prep time, but don't let them keep the curtain from rising on time. If the clock's ticking, let them know. After all, how long is it going to take Aztechnology to mess up the mage they grabbed? Can't wait too long before the runners spring her. If they're not moving fast enough, turn up the heat.

**Techniques for Less Stressful Shadowruns**
Here are some tips that gamemasters can use to keep track of story lines, NPCs, combat, computer networks, and the zillion and one other things that go into an adventure.

* **Equalizers:** Sometimes the team is going to get into more trouble than they can handle alone. If the gamemaster wants to bail them out, he can add an equalizer to the adventure. Say the player who runs the team's magician is sick and does not show up. The team is hosed without a mage, so the gamemaster can whip up an NPC magician to work with the team. Try letting a player run the equalizer, but be ready to take control of the NPC's actions if the player does not remain in character.
* **Displays:** A visual aid is so useful it is almost essential. Draw it on a big pad of paper, or use the various plastic mats made for gamers, with hexagonal or square grids. For figures, 25mm-scale metal miniatures (we kinda like the official Shadowrunâ„¢ figures) pack a lot of atmospheric detail and are small enough not to need an auditorium for a firefight.
* **Maps:** Maps are powerful tools. A map of the city where the campaign is set, even if it's just a sketch with shapes showing neighborhoods, is also darn near essential. Try using two: one to show the city that everyone knows (share this with the players) and another that shows the locations of all those secret places (keep this one). As the team discovers these locations, they can add them to the "public" map.
* **Masterminds:** Whenever writing an adventure, even a small one, consider whether it might be part of some vast conspiracy. The mastermind could be an organization or an individual. Drop occasional clues for the player characters and hint at such conspiracies, even if one does not exist in this particular case. Paranoia is not a problem in Shadowrun. It's a way of life.
* **NPC Files:** A file of major NPCs is a great help. Use a card file, a notebook, or a computer database to store profiles on contacts, family members, lovers, major specialists (magicians, doctors, lawyers), major NPCs in your game, the local police commander; any NPC likely to be used in adventures again and again. Easy access is important to keep the game moving.
* **Secrecy:** There are a lot of situations in Shadowrun that would benefit from a bit of secrecy. Sometimes simply announcing a target number tells the players some important piece of information that they shouldn't know. One alternative is to have the player roll the dice and announce the results. Then the gamemaster figures out the successes and relates what happens.

**AWARDING KARMA**
Characters get Karma for surviving an adventure and more Karma if they do well in the process. The gamemaster makes the awards. Give all surviving team members Karma in equal amounts, based on the following criteria.

* **Team Karma**
    A typical adventure should be worth maybe 3 to 4 team Karma Points. One for survival, a couple of objectives, and a point for the danger along the way. A real horror show would be worth 6 to 8 points or so, but that requires combat, danger, and powerful opposition, where the objective is wrapped in twisting paths of mystery!
* **Survival:** If the characters live, they get a point of Karma. Ain't life grand?
* **Success:** For every objective in the adventure that the team achieved, give each member a point of Karma. Partial awards are allowed. If they foiled the evil plan and stole the technological gizmo but the villain escaped, they get 2 out of a possible 3.
* **Threat:** Award extra Karma for dangerous adventures. A simple mission might not carry any bonus, but a mission against high odds or one where a dangerous enemy is involved is worth 1 or 2 extra points. A whirling nightmare of combat, confusion, and betrayal is worth 3 Karma Points each to the survivors. Let the level of opposition influence this. Even a simple run against a superior enemy (a powerful corp type or a yakuza oyabun) is worth extra Karma.

**Individual Karma Awards**
Team awards are made to everybody who participates in an adventure, even if a character did not get into the spotlight this time around. Individual Karma is awarded to characters who personally advance the story or the overall gaming enjoyment in some way.

If a character has an absolutely amazing run, and the group succeeds at a very nasty mission, he might get up to 10 or 12 Karma Points. A Karma award greater than 12 points for a single adventure should probably never happen.

* **Roleplaying:** Award 1 Karma Point to players who mostly stayed in character. Really good roleplaying is worth 2 Karma Points. The standards of roleplaying will depend on how a gamemaster and his or her group like to play. Be flexible! This is supposed to be fun, not a course in method acting.
* **Guts:** Brave and/or effective fighters should get a point or two of Karma. Stupidly brave fighters don't earn this award. If they are lucky enough to survive, that is its own reward. This would include gutsy magical battles in astral space and desperate combat in the Matrix as well as shoot-em-ups in the physical world.
* **Smarts:** Players who come up with a clever strategy, or solve a puzzling clue, or pull off a good scam, should get at least 1 point of Karma for their characters. This includes those smart enough to know when to surrender or run.
* **Right Place-Right Time:** Characters who are in the right place, with the right skill to do some necessary job, should get a point of Karma. Don't award Karma just for making good die rolls. The award is for having a skill that is vital and knowing when to use it. If the players knew they needed a lock picked and so had a character slot the Lockpicking Skill beforehand, a Karma award is unsuitable. If the team got trapped in a dead-end alley, with the bad guys closing in, and one of them spotted the old doorway and picked the lock under fire so the team could escape-well, that's different story.
* **Surprise:** Players can surprise you with plans that absolutely kill the story line. A surprising and effective strategy is worth a Karma Point to the player who comes up with it. Surprising and silly actions, on the other hand, get zip.
* **Humor:** If a player, acting in character, can paralyze the entire gaming group with laughter, that is worth 1 Karma Point in an adventure. We are in this for fun, after all.
* **Drama:** Likewise, if a player, acting in character, impresses the group with a particular piece of high drama (maybe even high melodrama), he should get a point of Karma.

**REPUTATION**
For a convenient measure of a character's reputation, keep a running total of his Karma. Keep two scores: **private rep**, which is the total Karma gained, and **public rep**, which may be a lesser number.

Private rep is known only in the shadows. No matter how cool the character may be, how slick the runs are, word will get out that the character's the one to see for a quiet job.

Public rep is how well known the character is outside this elite community, among the cops, petty fixers, and the media, for example. The gamemaster decides how much of the Karma for an adventure is public. If the character is really good, he may be able to stay in the shadows.

To determine if a character is known or not, subtract the public or private rep of the character from 1,000. Then divide that value by 50. That number is the target number for any Etiquette or similar tests that a non-player character makes to see if he has heard of the player character.

## CONTACTS
"You are who you know." -Street proverb

This chapter includes brief descriptions, including Attribute and Skill Ratings, for non-player characters likely to appear in Shadowrun adventures. The quotes may help the gamemaster get a "feel" for the character to help him add life and color to his own roleplaying. In many cases, some items of equipment have not been listed so that gamemasters can tailor the gear to their own needs.

**LEGWORK**
To follow up on or discover clues in an adventure, the player characters need to investigate people, places, and situations. One of the best ways for runners to get the information they need is through their contacts.

A success test using Street or Corporate Etiquette, Target Number 4, typically serves to find out what a contact does or does not know. The amount of information available from the contact depends on the number of successes the player achieves. Characters who achieve more than one success gain all the information available to all previous levels of success.

The gamemaster should try to make the player character's interaction with his contact consist of more than a few abstract die rolls. Play out the meeting in full: contacts are characters with their own lives, points of view, and needs, not simply spigots of information to be turned on and off automatically.

The player character rolls a number of dice equal to his Etiquette Skill to determine what information the contact knows and is willing to impart. Once the number of successes is determined, the gamemaster can roleplay the encounter with the appropriate information level in mind. Meetings should be tailored to the "personality" of specific contacts. Some will prefer a straightforward meet in a specific place, while others will only feel comfortable with elaborate forms of information exchange.

Contacts are generally considered trustworthy, as long as the runners play it safe. A player character should never compromise his contact by later making it obvious where he obtained the information or by revealing that the team may be planning to hit some group with which the contact is affiliated. Are the contact's ties stronger to his group or to the runner? A good runner never tests those ties by placing his contact in a position where he must choose.

Whether or not the runner has to pay for his contact's services and how long before the contact may want information or a favor in return are questions that add another dimension to these encounters. Dealing with a contact is a two-way street. Those gamemasters who need a base-line value to determine fees for information can use a formula of multiplying the contact's Skill Rating in his or her most appropriate Etiquette by how many successes the player rolled in his Etiquette Test. Multiply that total by the total of the contact's Charisma and Intelligence. Then multiply that final value by 10. The result is in nuyen. Gamemasters will, of course, adjust the base result to reflect the actual contact involved. Normal Negotiation procedures (p. 72) apply to determine the final payment for the information.

Runners may also ask their contacts to "check around," "keep their ear to the ground," or some other idiom describing generally listening for news. In such a case, the gamemaster makes an appropriate Etiquette Test for the contact at +2 against the target number given in the information table. (See published Shadowrun adventures.) If the Etiquette Test results in any successes, the contact reports the appropriate information to the runner in 2D6 hours, or at a time determined by the gamemaster. This is an excellent way for gamemasters to make sure that a certain piece of information makes it to the runners. The cost of this service is determined as if the contact had had access to the information initially.

The gamemaster can add another dimension to legwork by acknowledging that contacts are not always available at the convenience of the runners. Arrangements must be made before the actual meeting can take place. When a player character wants to meet with a contact, the gamemaster rolls 2D6, then multiplies the result by 30. The resulting base time is the number of minutes it will take to arrange the meeting with the contact. Players may elect to trade off successes from their Etiquette Test to reduce the time it takes to reach the contact, and so receive faster, but potentially less helpful, information. In this case, the gamemaster can have the player make the character's Etiquette Test at the time he announces his intention to meet with the contact. The player should also decide at that time how many successes he will trade off to reduce the waiting period. The base time value should be kept secret.

Deckers may also take an active role in acquiring general information. Many electronic information services exist in the era of Shadowrun-public, private, and secret-and these contain many gigapulses of data comprised of on-line conversations, rumors, stolen and dumped files, and the like. Deckers can create simple programs to search vast databases for key words and related terms, then download the information to their cyberdeck or Matrix-connected personal computer. To actually create the search program is a trivial matter; gamemasters should assume all deckers have one. Virtually any information available in this section can be found in the Matrix, if one knows where to look and has the time. The base time for such a search is 2D6 hours. The decker makes a success test against his or her Etiquette (Matrix) Skill, or defaults to Intelligence on the Skill Web. The target number is the same as given on the information table. Hacking Pool dice may not be used to supplement this Success Test roll. Etiquette Test successes can be traded off to reduce the base time for receiving information. No effective Appropriate Contact restrictions can be applied to obtaining this information, though the player must indicate what kind of information sources he is searching. If the character is searching corporate-related databases, Corporate Contact information is appropriate. If the character is searching a street-level chat-line database, Street Contact information is appropriate.

A decker is limited in the number of subjects he can research simultaneously, based on his own abilities and the available time. The maximum number of searches that the decker can conduct at any one time is equal to the character's Intelligence, divided by 2, rounded up. This base value assumes the decker does nothing else but sit and search, continually adjusting the search paths and parameters. If the character wishes to actively perform other activities, the gamemaster must decide how much time is taken up performing those other activities and adjust the base value accordingly.

### BARTENDER
"I been tending bar here for a lot of years now. Seen it all in my time. Know all the regulars real good. Their problems mostly, but their happy times, too. We're like family around here. Always looking out for each other. We're peaceable folks, though. Don't like no trouble. Trouble is bad for business."

**QUOTES**
* "Whazappening, man? Ain't seen you for a while. The usual?"
* "I caught a little something about that. Not first-hand, mind you. I heard from a man who knows a man. Understand?"
* "There was some suits in here asking after you, but I told them you ain't been around."

**COMMENTARY**
The bartender is a common source of information on current conditions in the streets and on the club circuit. He is discreet and reliable, for a price. Discounts for old friends and good customers, of course.

### BOUNTY HUNTER
"Nobody asked you to like me. You want the guy or not? I can bring him back alive, but that's extra. If all you want is a body, no problem. Of course, I'll guarantee identification. It's all part of the service."

**QUOTES**
* "Dead. Alive. Don't really matter to me. Of course, dead is a lot easier."
* "What do think you're paying for? Some fumble-fingered ork who doesn't know a circuit board from a bread board?"
* "Now ain't that sweet! Them furriners sure like to make their circuits small."

**COMMENTARY**
The bounty hunter is a hard woman. She lives by tracking those people that the corporate cops and hitmen don't have the time or inclination to track down. She's very good at what she does.

### CITY OFFICIAL
"We have a fine city here, one of the best-run metroplexes on the continent. All those rumors you may have heard about corruption in the current administration are just smoke from the opposition parties. Smoke and lies from malcontents. We are all hard workers, proud of our city and proud to serve the public as best we can."

**QUOTES**
* "No comment."
* "I'm sorry, but I really can't comment on that at this time."
* "I assure you that there is no conflict of interest in the present circumstances."

**COMMENTARY**
The city official is a typical member of the bureaucracy that runs the metroplex. Though concerned about his public image and the reactions of the voters, he is more concerned about his party bosses and his sponsors. He is most trustworthy during a campaign, but will gladly sell you out for a political or career advantage.

### COMPANY MAN
"I'm a company man. I know that doesn't make me very welcome in some places, but that doesn't bother me. I'm not here to make people happy. I'm here to do a job and I'll do whatever it takes to get it done. The company'll take care of the mess afterwards. It always does."

**QUOTES**
* "Nothing personal, friend. It's just business."
* "I'm just in it for the money and the benefit package, sweetheart."
* "You're being an annoyance to somebody important, chummer. I've been asked to resolve the matter."

**COMMENTARY**
The company man is the special executive agent for the corporation. He does his job, no questions asked. He is loyal, often unto death. After all, the corporation can even fix that.

### CORPORATE SECURITY GUARD
"Sure, I been through hard times, but I've got a good job with the corporation now. I'm a company man all the way. It's got just enough glamour and excitement to keep me happy right now. Someday, though, maybe I'll work my way up, and get myself a slot in the special ops division. Be one of those guys who push all the buttons. Yeah, that would be nice."

**QUOTES**
* "Hold it right there, chummer. Let's see your corp card."
* "Are you authorized for this section? Let's see your corp card."
* "Your card checks O.K. How about them Sonics? Quite a game the other night."

**COMMENTARY**
The corporate security guard is a simple man who is really more interested in his own private life and survival than dangerous action and adventure. He greatly values his position with the corporation and will work in its best interests, especially when there is a corporate official nearby watching him.

### CORPORATE SECRETARY
"I know what a lot of people think about us here at the company. Believe me, I've heard it all. I also know this is a strange thing for me to say, but ... I'm a company woman. All I can say is that the corporation's been very good to me and I intend to do anything I can to keep things that way."

**QUOTES**
* "I'm sorry, but Mr. Johnson is not available at the moment. May I take a message?"
* "Could you hold, please?"
* "I'm sorry, but Mr. Johnson is still unavailable."
* "He'll get back to you as soon as he can."

**COMMENTARY**
The corporate secretary is cool, efficient, loyal, and discreet. You'd want her working for you, if you could have her. She's as much a part of the corporate office as the furniture and telecom.

### DWARF TECHNICIAN
"I know it's a stereotype, but what do you want? Stereotypes make sense sometimes, you know. I happen to like tech, that's all. It's not like it's in my blood. It's just a knack, an interest. And I am very good at it."

**QUOTES**
* "Nobody appreciates good craftsmanship anymore."
* "What do think you're paying for? Some fumble-fingered ork who doesn't know a circuit board from a bread board?"
* "Now ain't that sweet! Them furriners sure like to make their circuits small."

### ELVEN HITMAN
"You came looking for the best and now you've found me. I heard of your proposal. Such a sanction is well within my capacity. I can do the work with no noise, no fuss, no trace. Satisfaction guaranteed."

**QUOTES**
* "I do hope you have arranged for quality logistic support. My last employer had a skinflint's tendency to skimp."
* "What did you say your credit balance was?"
* "I am not mad. You do not want to see me when I am mad."

**COMMENTARY**
The elven hitman is slick and smooth, and he knows it. He is the quintessential gentleman-assassin. He is always impeccably dressed, with accessories of the finest quality. His manners are smooth, with just a hint of dangerous arrogance. Unless, of course, he loses his temper.

### GANG BOSS
"To live on the streets is to know the streets. Who's on top, who's out, where the turf lines are. You're on my turf now, chummer. Let's here you sing. If I like the tune, maybe I'll let you keep your tongue. But you'd better not bring any trouble my way. I don't like strangers slopping their wars over onto my turf."

**QUOTES**
* "I'm the boss here."

**COMMENTARY**
The gang boss talks tough, and he is tough. He has to be in order to stay on top. But he's not stupid. He's learned a lot of hard lessons growing up on the streets. Just being tough doesn't cut it anymore.

"Machines are a lot nicer than people. They never sass you back, never get up on the wrong side of the bed. A woman can understand them. They never complain about grease on your clothes or dirt under your fingernails. Machines and me, we get along pretty well."

**QUOTES**
* "You broke it good this time."
* "How do ya expect me to fix that on yer budget?"
* "If ya don't want the weapons registered, it'll cost ya extra. Plenty extra.'

**COMMENTARY**
The mechanic is the person to see when your transport's down. She also does custom work.

### MEDIA PRODUCER
"The people want to know. That's what I always say. They have enquiring minds, and besides, it's their fundamental right to be informed. At least that's what we'll tell them."

**QUOTES**
* "For us, bad news is always good for the ratings."
* "If I can't find any news, I'll just have to make some."
* "Look, I been in the business since before you were born. I know what'll play and what won't."
* "All the people want is a good show. Just a show. Every day is so full of problems, complaints, and worries that when people come home at night, all they want is their cocktail, their solitude, their entertainment. That's where I come in."

**COMMENTARY**
The media producer is an entertainment entrepreneur, who draws a very fine line between news information and entertainment. She's got an eye for what will make people sit up and take notice, and how to present the stories in a way that won't leave anybody too upset. Broadcasting is a business, after all.

### METAHUMAN RIGHTS ACTIVIST
"We're all human, you know. It's as simple as that. The disgraceful actions of Lone Star's storm troopers at the O.R.C. rally last week will not be forgotten. They never should have gassed the crowd. There was no real provocation. It was a peaceful demonstration. Disgraceful. I just came from filing a grievance with the city court. We'll see what the governor has to say when her Gestapo is slapped with a lawsuit."

**QUOTES**
* "Elves (and dwarfs and trolls, sometimes even orks) are people, too."
* "How would you like to be treated like that?"
* "You think the March on Fresno was tough. Nothing. I was down in SF on Goblinization Day."

**COMMENTARY**
The metahuman rights activist may have another job, but her true calling is working to see that all branches of humanity receive equal justice before the law. Then again, any unjust law deserves to be broken. The activist is a mortal foe of the Humanis cultists.

### MR. JOHNSON
"Let me assure you that I fully understand your position. I hope you understand mine. Let's just say it would be very uncomfortable for all concerned were any news of this to be made public knowledge. I'm quite sure that we can rely on your discretion."

**QUOTES**
* "If you're caught, we never heard of you before."
* "This conversation never took place. Understand?"
* "It's a small job. Minimal complications."
* "Payment will be handled the usual way. You may check your accounts before you leave, if you like."

**COMMENTARY**
Mr. Johnson may not look the same the next time you see him. He may not even be a he. But don't be fooled-he's the man. Mr. Johnson is the generic slang term for a corporate-insider connection. He's got the bucks and he's got the jobs. And he's also got a private army to hunt you down if you cross him.

### SQUATTER
"Watchu staring at, chummer? Ain't ya never seen a poor person? Watchu doing here? This squat's mine! Whoa, calm down. Don't want no trouble. Let's not get violent. I can find another. Always have. Just let me slip past ya. I won't say nothing. Truth. Real truth. Not a word."

**QUOTES**
* "Mind your own biz."
* "Ain't seen nothing. Ain't heard nothing."
* "I wasn't always like this."
* "Dey went dat way."

**COMMENTARY**
The squatter is a tough victim of the underside of the metroplex, hardened and beaten down by life in the slums. He is a survivor who tries to roll with the punches, and still wants to see another day. In one piece.

### STREET DOC
"In trouble again? No, don't tell me about it! It's better for both of us if I don't know. Just keep your mouth shut and don't squirm until the local takes effect. I'd wait, but you're the one in a hurry."

**QUOTES**
* "Stop bleeding on the floor."
* "Interested in a good deal on some vat tissue? Source says it's real Chiba stock. I could stitch it down while I've got you opened up. No? Maybe a little cosmetic work since I have the laser scalpels out?"
* "This is the third time this year. Haven't you any respect for quality craftsmanship?"

**COMMENTARY**
The street doc may be a quack or he may be a top-flight surgeon, but either way he's an outlaw's best friend. He'll always keep his mouth shut and won't report any suspicious wounds to the corp-sec or register your augmentations with the manufacturer for full-warranty coverage. He's got his own skeletons in the closet.

### STREET COP
"When I signed on with Lone Star, I believed all their recruitment hype. I was young. I know better now, but I'm still working for them. Guess I like the job. I'd feel better about the job if they were real police, but them days are long gone. We're businessmen now. Still, the streets should be safe. I believe that. Guess that's why I'm still doing the job."

**QUOTES**
* "Look, I'm just doing my job."
* "Let's not have any trouble here."
* "Dead or alive, you're coming with me."
* "Don't try it, chummer. Don't even think it."

**COMMENTARY**
The street cop is a slightly disillusioned, frustrated, but still determined servant of the law. He works for an independent corporation rather than the government. It means better benefits, but lesser prestige. He has learned to live with this, too. A few cops have, as always, succumbed to the temptations of their positions and become "bad cops," but most remain true to their honor.

### TALISMONGER
"If you're looking for the magical goods, I got 'em. Powders, bones, potions. Only the best ingredients and materials. What did you have in mind? If I don't have it, I can make arrangements to get it. I've got a lot of friends all over the 'plex and not a few outside of it."

**QUOTES**

* "On my uncle's spirit! It really is elven (or dwarf or ork or troll) workmanship."
* "Of course, I can't guarantee that it'll work under all conditions."

**COMMENTARY**
The talismonger is a broker of magical goods and services, sort of an occult middle-woman. Sometimes she will moonlight as a fence for stolen magical materials as well as information.

### TRIBAL CHIEF
"You are sitting in the council lodge of my people, stranger. You do not give orders here. You may make a request, and the council may consider your words, but no demand will be made here. If we find it in the interests of the tribe, we may agree to do as you ask."

**QUOTES**
* "I am the chief. They do the singing."
* "Do you play chess?"
* "I have a fine horse, so who needs a car? A horse is a renewable resource. Have you had any success breeding your car lately?"
* "Before I present you to the tribe, I will have to check your file on the council database."

**COMMENTARY**
The tribal chief is a man wise in the ways of the modern world, not just the ancient traditions. He must be well-aware of technology and the corporations if he is to guide his tribe well. He therefore makes it a point to know what is going on around him at all times.

### YAKUZA BOSS
"The times now are not what they once were. This is life. A man who wishes to be successful must adapt as society changes. We in the yakuza have done so, preserving as much of the old, honorable ways as possible while at the same time learning the new. Society will always need us. We are a vital part of the way the world works."

**QUOTES**
* "The new men are nothing more than gangsters and ruffians. They have no real sense of honor. And the Koreans and the Chinese are mere barbarians."

**COMMENTARY**
The yakuza boss, despite his philosophizing and courteous manners, is still a criminal mastermind. His true designs are ruthless, yet he always seeks to spread a veneer of culture and gentility over his rough edges. The older bosses prefer influence-peddling and embarrassment tactics over the crude intimidation and violence favored by the new blood.

# CRITTERS
"All your weapons and cyberjunk don't mean drek when you hear the barghest HOWL!" -Ad copy for the simsense thriller Howl.

## POWERS OF THE AWAKENED
The powers, or innate magical abilities, of the Awakened are varied. Following are general descriptions of these powers, which individual creatures may or may not possess.

Virtually all paranormal beings have some form of attack ability. If they rely on simple physical capabilities, the details are given with their statistics. Specialized forms of attack are also noted. These may range from the painful, but mostly annoying, smack on the head with a frying pan by a hearth spirit, to the shattering lightning bolts of the storm spirits.

[GAMEMASTER'S NOTE: When two directly opposing powers, such as accident and guard, are applied to the same character, each makes a test, using the other power's rating as its target number. The effects of the winning power apply, with a rating equal to its net successes. This is called an opposed test. Also note that any game mechanics given with the power descriptions are not intended as hard and fast rules, but as suggestions to the gamemaster. Players can never be absolutely certain of the capabilities of the opposition; a chance always exists that the power will work slightly differently in this particular critter. Uncertainty is a wonderful dramatic tool. Because elementals and nature spirits may be summoned, their powers should remain as consistent as possible.]

**ACCIDENT**
Accident power gives a being the ability to cause an apparently normal accident to occur. The nature of the accident and its result will vary according to the terrain the being controls.

A character hit with accident power must make a test using Quickness or Intelligence (whichever is higher), with a target number equal to the Essence of the being using the power. If the character fails the test, its action is lost as it trips, gets a mouthful of leaves, or even a cream pie in the face. Accident is not dangerous in itself, but the environment can make it so. A fall on a narrow mountain ledge, for instance, can be most unfortunate.

**ALIENATION**
Alienation power gives the being the ability to enshroud its victim(s) in an aura that makes the victim invisible to others. Treat this as an invisibility spell, with a Force Rating equal to the being's Essence. A victim will remain under alienation power for a number of hours equal to the empowered creature's Essence.

The alienation power is not intended as the kind of beneficial power of invisibility. Victims of alienation are invisible, intangible, and inaudible to those around them. It is as if those afflicted by this power do not exist at all. Drivers will not stop for them, no one talks to them, their friends shoot through them to hit targets. Despair fills their soul.

The victim must achieve 1 success, using whatever Attribute or skill seems appropriate, against the critter's Essence as the target number, in order to avoid a dangerous situation or to get someone's attention.

**ANIMAL CONTROL**
Some beings have heightened empathy with animals, usually limited to a particular type, such as predators or scaled animals. This power allows the being to automatically prevent that animal from attacking, giving an alarm, and so on. By concentrating, the being can control an individual animal, experiencing the world through its senses and directing its behavior. This behavior would fall within what is normal for the animal's type. That is, a controlled monkey could not drive a car. The number of small animals (cats, rats, and so on) that a creature may control is equal to its (Charisma)D6. A being may control a number of larger animals (wolves, lions, and so on) equal to its Charisma.

**PARANATURALISM**
Earth is home to an almost limitless variety of animals. Even in the trying times of the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries, new species continued to be discovered while others slipped into extinction. During the turbulent period of the Awakening, more new species and subspecies were identified than in any period since the development of scientific classification (even after discounting numerous mutations or outright hoaxes).

The explosion of novel and variant life forms has led to the development of several new fields of scientific study often combined under the heading of **paranaturalism**. Paranaturalists specialize in species identified after 2000, and many further specialize in aspects such as parabiology, parasociology (especially among the various metahuman and officially recognized sentient species), and paranatural biotechnology. Some researchers are even investigating fossil life forms for evidence of paraspecies. Research into the origins of these paraspecies has yielded some fascinating theories.

Most paraspecies seem to be a particular expression of DNA in the presence of high levels of magical energy. In these species, one generation gives birth to paraspecies young but remains unaffected itself. In time, the natural species will vanish, replaced completely by the paraspecies.

In certain cases, all or part of the natural species undergoes "goblinization" as some threshold is crossed in the rising tide of magic. Unless the whole species changes en masse, the natural species continues (as in the human species), but will produce individuals of the paraspecies at later birthings. Occasionally, an apparently normal individual of such a species will express paranormal traits or capabilities at puberty.

A few species consistently produce young resembling the original natural species but who undergo goblinization at puberty. Most such individuals are hostile and vicious.

The most perplexing problem facing paranaturalists is the existence of several paraspecies of vertebrates that have three pairs of limbs, with one pair typically forming a set of wings. Most familiar of these are western dragons and griffins. The presence of six limbs violates long-standing theories of vertebrate evolution, and no satisfactory explanation yet exists. Even the normally garrulous and opinionated great dragon (his classification) Dunkelzahn refuses to address the issue.

However, careful examination of Dunkelzahn's early interviews with representatives of the world media reveals several references to an "awakening." These very comments were what prompted Holly Brighton to label the new global condition as the Awakened world. The same comments led some researchers to conclude that the great dragons came into being when a certain mana level was reached, manifesting from a kind of collective unconscious template. Most scientific circles give little credence to this theory, even though it accounts for the dragon's six-limbed form.

A countertheory posits that the great dragons are visitors from another world where a six-legged form is the vertebrate pattern, but the scientific community generally rejects this idea as well. The popular belief that the great dragons awakened from a millennia-long sleep seems equally incredible.

In all cases save the alien-life form approach, the theories cannot account for dragons and other six-limbed forms. According to the alien-origin theory, these arrived on Earth, along with other paraspecies, via a "space ark." This, too, is unlikely, as the paraspecies in question appeared at distinctly different times.

-Excerpt from the introduction to *Changeling Terra: A New View of Life*, by Gamiel Shaath and Miguel Martinez

**BINDING**
Binding gives a being the power to make its victim "stick" to a surface or to itself. The binding has a Strength Rating equal to twice the being's Essence.

**COMPULSION**
A being with compulsion power can compel its victim to perform a specific action, as with a post-hypnotic suggestion. Often a being may only compel one particular action. Treat as a control actions spell, using the being's Essence for the spell's Force Rating.

**CONCEALMENT**
This power refers to a being's ability to hide within its terrain rather than to its own ability to become invisible. This power is generally associated with nature spirits. A being can use concealment power to hide itself and its companions from danger, or alternatively, can use the power to hide something that people are seeking. Concealment adds the being's Essence Rating to the target number of any Perception Tests the gamemaster requires.

**CONFUSION**
Confusion power gives a being the ability to make its victims lose their sense of direction and wander in confusion through the terrain it controls. The consequences may vary widely. A hearth spirit causing confusion in a house might lead to nothing worse than someone bumping into walls or mistaking a closet door for an exit. Confusion in the realm of a mountain spirit could easily lead someone to topple off the nearest cliff.

Characters who attempt any form of Success Test while under this power are subject to a negative target modifier equal to the Essence of the being using the power. In addition, whenever the victim must make any decision, he must make a Willpower Test with a target number equal to the being's Essence. If he fails, he is unable to make up his mind. Something or someone must remind him of the need for a decision. An attack, or a verbal reminder from a companion, provides an opportunity for another test. If left alone in this state, a character will eventually wander off.

The power remains in effect as long as the victim remains within the area of terrain controlled by the being.

**ELECTRICAL PROJECTION**
Electrical projection power gives a being the power to strike a target with a discharge of electricity. Depending on the being, results may range from a mild shock to a lightning bolt. A victim can neither dodge nor defend against electrical projection attacks. Typically, such attacks do (Essence)M damage and disorient the target for a number of turns equal to the being's Essence.

**ENGULF**
Engulf power gives a being the ability to draw its victim into itself or the terrain or element appropriate to its nature. The victim is subject to all effects of being submerged in the substance, the least of which is usually suffocation.

The gamemaster should make an opposed test between the victim's Willpower and the creature's Essence, each using the opposition's rating as the target number. Compare the total number of successes. If the creature generates more successes, the victim will enter the substance and begin to suffocate or suffer other appropriate damage. The victim cannot escape as long as the creature maintains his power against him. An attack on another victim (the being using either a power or else physically) will release the first one from the engulf power.

For each turn that a character is suffocating, the player makes a Body Test against a Damage Code of (being's Essence)M Stun. Dermal plating and armor do not count toward resisting this damage.

Spirits with this power follow these rules:
* The engulf attack is a melee attack. The spirit uses its Quickness to hit the target. Targets must counterattack successfully to avoid engulfment. If a victim is engulfed, the effects vary.
* Every time it is the victim's action, he or she can try to escape. Make an opposed test using the victim's Strength and the spirit's Essence against a base Target Number 4. If the victim wins, freedom! On each of the spirit's actions, engulfed victims must resist appropriate damage.
* **Fire Engulf:** Same as if struck by the spirit in combat; [(Essence)M damage, add +2 Power for flame aura]. The character must resist (Essence +2)M damage. Impact armor helps against this damage, but not ballistic armor, which tends to melt.
* **Water Engulf:** Victim must resist (Essence)M Stun damage. The power is modified by +1 for each action that the spirit has had since engulfing the victim. This is rougher than normal drowning, because the spirit is capable of exerting great pressure on engulfed victims. Victims who pass out are still exposed to damage during the spirit's actions, and will take Lethal damage as a result. Eventually, they will drown.
* **Air Engulf:** Victim must resist (Essence)S Stun effects of the noxious breath power using Willpower or Body, whichever is greater. Because the spirit can astrally penetrate breathing gear or other protective systems, these provide no defense. The engulfed victim begins to take Lethal damage after being rendered unconscious, and eventually suffocates.
* **Earth Engulf:** Victim must resist (Essence)S damage from the crushing weight of the spirit. Impact armor defends against this, but not ballistic.

**ENHANCED PHYSICAL ATTRIBUTES**
With this power, a being adds its current Essence Rating to its Physical Attributes. This power to enhance may be limited to specific Attribute(s) and/or in duration and number of uses.

**ENHANCED SENSES**
Enhanced senses power includes low-light and thermographic vision, improved hearing and smell, heat-sensing organs, sonar, motion detection (ability to detect electrical field disturbances), and so on.

**ESSENCE DRAIN**
Essence drain power allows a being to drain the Essence from another, adding the points to its own rating. The being may increase its Essence Rating to a maximum of twice the maximum for its type. Humanoid beings, therefore, have a maximum Essence Rating of 12.

Essence is transferred only in the presence of strong emotion. This can be a lover's passion, the terror of an unwilling victim, or the rage of a defeated enemy, but it must be strong and it must be directed personally at the being. The Essence drain usually requires some transfer of physical material, such as blood for a vampire or flesh for a wendigo, though often only a token amount.

A being draining Essence requires some minutes undisturbed. The being may drain as many points of Essence as it currently possesses. The minimum drain is 1 point.

A being cannot drain Essence from a fiercely resisting victim. The victim must participate willingly or must be physically or magically subdued. The psychic stimulus of the being's touch (such as a vampire's bite) opens an empathic link between the being and his victim, who will feel ecstasy at being drained. The release of endorphins and other changes in body chemistry triggered by this experience can be addictive. A victim must make a Willpower Test against a Target Number 4 each time he or she is drained. Failure indicates addiction, and the subject will actively cooperate in hopes of receiving another session. This will, of course, lead to a rapid loss of Essence and the death of the addict.

Beings can drain Essence from other beings with essence drain power without the necessity of strong emotional energy, but the contact still requires undisturbed time. The action requires an Essence Test using a Target Number 4 for both beings. The being achieving the most successes drains the other of Essence equal to the extra successes. For example, two vampires with Essence Ratings of 5 each are locked in a transfer. Each rolls 5 dice. The first scores 3 successes, the other scores 5. The second vampire will drain 2 points of Essence from the first. A vampire whose Essence is reduced to 0 in this manner dies at once and permanently.

**FEAR**
This gives a being the power to fill its victims with overwhelming fear of either the terrain or of the being. The victim will race in panic for the nearest point of apparent safety.

The gamemaster should make a test pitting the victim's Willpower against the creature's Essence, each using the opposition's rating as the target number. The creature's net number of successes is used to gauge the severity of the victim's fear.

**FLAME AURA**
Flame aura power gives a being the ability to make its surface ripple with flame, burning any who touch it. Intense forms of this power may make wooden weapons burst into flame at a touch or even melt metal or plastic weapons. The flames add +2 to the Power of any successful melee attack.

Any successful melee attack against a creature with flame aura power means that the attacker also takes damage from the intense heat. The attacker must make a Body Test against a Damage Code of (being's Essence)M. Armor may help resist this damage if the gamemaster agrees that the attacker struck the creature with an armored portion of his or her body.

**FLAME PROJECTION**
With this power, a being can project flames, often in the form of fiery breath. This attack has a Damage Code of (Essence)L.

A being may sustain the attack, but will suffer Drain in the same way a magician does, as Drain (Essence)S. When the attack is sustained, the being spreads the effect of the attack over a number of square meters equal to its Essence.

Highly flammable items may be ignited by a flame projection attack.

**GUARD**
Guard power gives the being the capacity to prevent any accident-both natural and those caused by accident power-within the terrain controlled by the being.

**HARDENED ARMOR**
Creatures with hardened armor have an exoskeleton possessing the same qualities as vehicle armor. See Vehicles, Weapons, and Magic, p. 108, for more information.

**IMMUNITY TO AGE**
With this power, a being will not age, and will never suffer the debilitating effects of advanced age.

**IMMUNITY TO NORMAL WEAPONS**
This power gives a being an Armor Rating equal to double its Essence when resisting damage from ordinary weapons. This power has no effect against magical weapons. Against elemental damage (such as fire, lack of air, water cannon, and so on), the effect is halved (the being has an Armor Rating equal to its Essence).

**IMMUNITY TO PATHOGENS**
This immunity gives the being additional dice equal to double its Essence when making tests to resist infection or disease.

**IMMUNITY TO POISONS**
This immunity gives the being additional dice equal to double its Essence when making tests to resist the effects of a toxin (poison or drug).

**INFECTION**
When a being that drains Essence (such as a vampire) has reduced a victim's Essence to 0, the victim will sicken and apparently die. Shortly after this "death," the individual will return to life as a being of the type that drained the Essence (Essence still equals 0). Such "newborn" creatures are dangerous. Though they are barely conscious of their new state, instinct will drive them to satisfy their hunger in any way they can.

After their "deaths," characters so infected are no longer under the control of their player, but come under the gamemaster's control.

**INFLUENCE**
Influence power allows a being to insinuate suggestions into the mind of a victim, predisposing that person to some form of action, reaction, or emotion. Make a test matching the being's Charisma Attribute (or Essence, if it has no Charisma) against the victim's Willpower, each using the opponent's rating as the target number. Use the number of net successes as a guide to how strongly the suggestion is taken.

[GAMEMASTER'S NOTE: The ability to Influence fear is considerably less effective than the power of Fear.]

**MAGICAL GUARD**
The being's magical guard power (which is equal to its Essence) serves as spell defense for the person(s) it is warding.

**MANIFESTATION**
An astral being with manifestation power may temporarily manifest in the physical world. When doing so, its Physical Attribute Rating is the same as its Essence Rating, unless some modifier is specified in the description of that being. The minimum manifested Rating is 1. Moreover, the Essence Rating of these beings functions as spell defense.

When an attacker strikes or shoots at a manifested spirit with a mundane weapon, use the character's Willpower Attribute instead of the usual attack skill. Against spirit foes, unshakable strength of will is more important than weapon skill. Attacks with weapon foci, other magical attacks, and attacks using a spirit's vulnerability (see below) are not subject to this rule.

In addition, manifested spirits have the power of immunity to normal weapons against ranged combat attacks, for these do not carry the full "charge" of the attacker's will. Against such attacks, spirits have "armor" equal to twice their Force.

They do not, however, have this power against melee attacks because there is nothing to reduce the effects of their opponent's courage in close combat.

In addition, spirits in astral form receive a +20 to their Initiative, and a +10 when manifest.

**MIST FORM**
The being can transform its body into a mist, apparently by controlling the molecular cohesion of its cells. A mist can pass through any crack or crevice that is not airtight, even penetrating filtration systems that are proof against gases or pollution. Systems that are proof against bacterial or viral incursions will stop a being in mist form. While in mist form, the being has the additional power of immunity to normal weapons, including weapons to which it has a vulnerability. While in mist form, a being can be affected by magic. If the being is exposed to a substance to which it is allergic, it will be forced to return to its corporeal form. (The easiest allergen to apply to this purpose is sunlight. Other substances require that a fine spray of powder or liquid be directed into the mist). A being must use a Complex Action to shift form. If forced out of mist form, the change is instantaneous.

**MOVEMENT**
The being may increase or decrease its victim's movement rate within the terrain it controls, multiplying or dividing the rate by the being's Essence.

**NOXIOUS BREATH**
The nauseating effects of the being's breath incapacitate the victim. The victim makes a Willpower or Body Test (whichever rating is greater) against the spell's Damage Code (being's Essence)S Stun. Armor and dermal plating do not help resist damage in this test.

**PARALYZING TOUCH (HOWL)**
Any touch (including an attack that does no damage) reduces the victim's Quickness by the being's Essence rating for 2D6 minutes. Multiple touches can cause multiple reductions in Quickness. A victim whose Quickness is reduced to 0 is incapable of any movement. To continue breathing, it must make a Willpower Test each minute against a target number of the being's Essence. If the victim fails one of these tests, it has stopped breathing and will die in 1D6 minutes unless the paralysis effect wears off before that time or someone applies first aid.

The aural form of this power is called paralyzing howl and requires a test pitting the critter's Essence against the target's Willpower and vice versa, in order to be effective. The critter needs only 1 success to affect the target.

**PESTILENCE**
The victim is subject to an infection of a disease similar to VITAS-3.

**PETRIFYING GAZE**
If the victim meets the being's eyes, it must make a test using its Intelligence Attribute against a target number of the being's Essence Rating. A being can keep a number of victims petrified equal to its Essence Rating. A failed test means that the only actions a victim can perform are attempts to break the spell, which require the same test described above.

**PSYCHOKINESIS**
The being may generate psychokinetic energy with a Strength equal to its Essence Rating, similar to the magic fingers spell.

**REGENERATION**
The being cannot be killed by wounds except when the damage injures the spine or brain. Check for this type of damage whenever the being takes a Deadly wound or its cumulative wounds take it down. Roll 1D6. A result of 1 indicates that the being is, indeed, dead. Otherwise, wounds still hurt the being, giving penalties to actions as for normal characters, but if the wounds do not cause death, the wounds vanish at the beginning of the next Combat Turn.

Damage from weapons that cause massive tissue damage (fire, explosion, and so on) will also kill on a 1D6 die roll result of 1 or 2.

**SEARCH**
The being may seek any person, place, or object within its terrain. Its rating for perceiving hidden objects or persons is equal to twice its Essence. To remain undiscovered, a character or object must make a successful opposed test, as described at the beginning of this chapter.

**VENOM**
The being's attack is poisonous, with a Damage Code of (Essence)S. Treat as a toxin with a speed of 1 turn.

**WEAKNESSES OF AWAKENED BEINGS**
Even as new species came into existence wielding new and unexpected powers, these life forms also carried certain major and minor disadvantages that could be exploited. Perhaps these weaknesses were nature's attempt to even up the score.

**ALLERGY**
Many beings suffer reactions to one or more substances or conditions. Usually, the effects only last while the being is in contact with the substance. Common allergy-causing substances include sunlight, ferrous metals, holy objects (such allergies appear to be psychosomatic), plastics, and pollutants.

* **Nuisance:** Annoys the being but has no significant game effects.
* **Mild:** Causes discomfort and distracts the being (add +1 to all target numbers).
* **Severe:** The touch of the substance is painful to the being, often forcing retreat. If contact is prolonged, a reaction will occur. Add +2 to the Power of weapons made of the substance.
* **Extreme:** Even the slightest touch of the substance results in a reaction and causes Physical damage to the being. Add +2 to the Power of weapons made of the substance, as for a Severe allergy, and such a weapon also causes a Light wound.

**ESSENCE LOSS**
The being has no inherent Essence. It gains Essence only by regularly consuming the Essence of others. The being loses 1 point of Essence every month.

A being whose Essence is reduced to 0 will die within days, perhaps even hours. During this period, the being is extremely dangerous because, whatever its normal nature, it now behaves as a starved predator and will hunt fresh Essence with mindless ferocity.

**REDUCED SENSES**
Any or all of the being's senses may be limited in effectiveness. Typically, reduced senses function at half the normal rating.

**VULNERABILITY**
The metabolism of some beings is disrupted drastically by objects made of particular substances. The Damage Level of such weapons increases by 1. For example, a 2L wooden club would be a 2M weapon against a being vulnerable to wood.

Beings recover (or regenerate) from wounds inflicted by the substance to which they are vulnerable at the same speed at which they recover from wounds caused by other sources.

Simple contact with the substance is treated as a Nuisance allergy reaction.

**CYBERWARE FOR CRITTERS**
Critters may be equipped with cyberware, usually bodyware. Such operations tend to unhinge the animals, making them vicious and barely controllable. Cyber-modified animals are as likely to attack their handlers as intended targets. When unleashing such an animal, roll 1D6. If the result equals or exceeds the animal's Essence Rating, it will turn on its handler.

Headware designed to control this tendency makes the animal more stupid and less perceptive, as well as lowering its Essence further. Each control implant lowers Essence by 1 and subtracts 2 from the die roll made when checking the animal's behavior. Each implant also lowers the animal's Mental Attribute Rating by 1.

## SELECTED AWAKENED BEINGS
The following descriptions are excerpted from the well-respected *Paterson Field Guide Series, volume 23, Field Guide to the Awakened.*

The sizes and weights listed in the identifications are typical of an adult member of the species. Larger (often 10 to 20 percent and occasionally as much as 30 percent) and smaller (typically 60 to 75 percent in a species displaying gender size-differences) individuals are possible. A description of coloration and distinctive physical characteristics follows.

The habitats listed are those preferred by the creature. Obviously, the creatures may be encountered away from that environment, especially if being used as a guardian or watchdog.

Many beings display magic powers without being magicians, achieving feats possible only through magic, such as the ability to fly in defiance of aerodynamic laws. This magical capability is described as **innate**. Beings that can function as magicians are termed **active**.

Many paraspecies are known worldwide. The field guide entry lists the area where the species was originally identified. Usually this was the home range of the natural species from which the paranatural species emerged.

Specific powers and weaknesses observed in the species are listed, as are special characteristics such as enhanced senses power. The strengths of certain powers (such as various attack forms) are listed with the creature's game statistics.

### BANSHEE
*Noxplorator letalis*

**Identification:** This creature is indistinguishable from an elf, save that it may appear very gaunt. All elven authorities and many paranatural specialists deny that a banshee is an elf.
**Similar Species:** The vampire (p. 231) and the wendigo (p. 232) share certain close similarities with this creature.
**Habitat:** The banshee prefers desolate places near human habitations.
**Magic Capability:** Many innate abilities, including evidence of active magic capability among some specimens.
**Habits:** Nocturnal. The banshee is solitary and reclusive except when hunting. Unlike the vampire, it appears to survive completely on Essence derived from its terrified victims. The creature wails, instilling fear to the point of blind panic in its prey, which will flee in mindless terror. The banshee pursues until its victim is physically exhausted, then closes for the kill. The final attack is, apparently, a form of assault, which leaves its target an apparent victim of cardiac arrest. The banshee rarely shows any restraint, almost always draining a victim in the initial attack.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Paranaturalist Charles Forte has advanced the hypothesis that the banshee is the typical expression of HMHVV (Human-Metahuman Vampiric Virus) in elves.
**Powers:** Enhanced Senses (Low-Light Vision; Smell; Hearing), Essence Drain, Fear, Immunity (Age, Pathogens, Toxins), Mist Form, Regeneration
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Severe), Essence Loss, Vulnerability (Wood, Silver)

---

### BARGHEST
*Canis inferni*

**Identification:** The barghest's head and body reach a length of 1.5 meters, but its height at the shoulder is only .9 meters. Its tail measures .7 meters, and its typical weight is 80 kilograms. The barghest resembles an oversized mastiff of pure white or pure black. Its fur is very short and lies flat on its body, which sometimes gives the impression of a naked hide. Its ears are sharply pointed and set high on its head. A protruding spine runs along the back. Even in the absence of reflected light, the barghest's eyes shine red and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of luminescent bacteria in its saliva. Its skull has 42 teeth. The female barghest has eight mammae.
**Similar Species:** At night, the barghest is often confused with the common hellhound (not included in this selection), especially in its black variation, but even low light reveals the distinctive wolf-like outline of the hellhound that distinguishes it easily from the barghest.
**Habitat:** Wilderness forests, tundra, and moors
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** Nocturnal. The barghest hunts alone or in pairs during breeding season, but may travel in packs of twelve or more during the rest of the year. It feeds on anything available, primarily large mammals that it pursues to exhaustion before closing for the kill. Hunting range is 100 kilometers or more in diameter. The breeding season lasts from late winter to early spring.
**Young:** Birth occurs in the spring, usually in litters of six to seven pups. These are a mottled gray, darkening or lightening as they mature, usually within two years.
**Range:** Northern portions of North America, Europe, and Asia
**Commentary:** The barghest's howl induces a fear reaction in humans and many animals. The beast uses the howl to herd prey, the pitch shifting once the prey is cornered and often causing near-catatonia in its victim.
**Powers:** Fear, Paralyzing Howl (opposes Willpower), Enhanced Senses (Sonar)
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Strong)

---

### BASILISK
*Varanis lapidis*

**Identification:** The basilisk's head and body length average 1.5 meters and its height at the shoulder is .2 meters. Its tail is about 1 meter long, and its total body weight is about 100 kilograms. Its skin is covered with knobby scales in a pattern of black and bright yellow, which condenses to a solid black at the muzzle and the end of the tail. The skull has 40 saw-edged teeth that are usually of several sizes and are constantly renewed.
**Similar Species:** In size and shape, the basilisk resembles the Komodo dragon and other large lizards. In fact, the similarity of its color pattern to that of the young Komodo dragon leads some researchers to believe that the basilisk is an Awakened variant.
**Habitat:** The basilisk prefers the rain forest or open woodland in temperate or tropical zones.
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** The basilisk is most active during the day, especially in the morning hours. It is normally a solitary animal that is often drawn, possibly by the smell of blood, to the site of a fresh kill. It feeds primarily on small animals, usually mammals, but will devour anything it can catch. Its natural camouflage blends in with the rocky outcrops where it nests. Though fiercely territorial, the basilisk ranges up to ten kilometers from its den to forage for food. Its life expectancy is thirteen years in captivity, eight to ten years in the wild. Its breeding season is in the spring.
**Young:** The female basilisk lays three to twelve eggs in late spring. Hatchlings emerge six weeks later.
**Economic Value:** Some elements of society use young basilisks as biotech guard systems, but older individuals have proven too difficult to habituate to new surroundings.
**Range:** Originally confined to the Indonesian archipelago, the species has spread worldwide as specimens trapped or bred for guard functions have escaped and bred in suitable environments.
**Commentary:** Paranaturalists believe that the basilisk uses a mana spell to calcify its victim. It is believed that in some unknown way the minerals in the victim's body are vital to the creature's metabolism.
**Powers:** Petrifying Gaze
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Extreme, Reflection of own gaze. Failure to achieve 2 successes on a Body Test with a Target Number 6 results in a crumbling basilisk statue.)

---

### COCKATRICE
*Aveterror lapidaris*

**Identification:** The cockatrice's head and body commonly measure 2 meters. Its tail is 1.2 meters long, and its total body weight is about 40 kilograms. The cockatrice is a long-legged, bird-like, feathered creature whose predominant coloration is yellow. The head has a bright red coxcomb and a sharp, horny beak.
**Similar Species:** Large adult specimens are often confused with the phoenix (p. 229), but the presence of the fleshy comb on the head and the long, scaled tail should warn the observer to avoid the animal. Its touch is dangerous.
**Habitat:** The cockatrice prefers open plains and scrubland, but is also known to frequent open woodlands.
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** Diurnal. Though capable of limited and awkward flight, the cockatrice is better adapted to running. It prefers to chase down its prey, often rising briefly into the air to strike downward with its taloned feet. The cockatrice feeds on animals weighing from 10 to 80 kilograms. Nests are defended by both parents until the eggs hatch, when one parent (possibly the female) departs. The other becomes guardian of the chicks for the next several months. Specimens have lived up to 25 years in captivity. Breeding season is in spring.
**Young:** The cockatrice nest consists of 12 to 15 eggs that hatch after a 35-day gestation. The chicks, which are covered with dun-colored, hair-like feathers, are capable of running with their parent shortly after hatching. The young resemble that of the Australian emu, a bird most paranaturalists believe to be the low-mana form of this animal.
**Economic Value:** Like the basilisk, the cockatrice is in demand as a security animal. Only unhatched eggs are selected, as the newly hatched chick must be imprinted on a handler before it can be trained.
**Range:** The cockatrice's range has expanded greatly in recent years. It is now found worldwide.
**Commentary:** The adult cockatrice has the paranatural ability to paralyze with a touch from its tail. In its leaping attack, it whips its tail around in an attempt to paralyze its target.
**Powers:** Paralyzing Touch, Invulnerability (Own touch)

### DRACOFORMS
Within the group of dracoform Awakened creatures are several related types. Though major physical differences are apparent between the types grouped here, they display a basic similarity even if no true relationship exists. All are of large size and saurian nature, and match ancient descriptions of dragons and great serpents said to be seen in areas where dragons have been sighted since the Awakening.
**Magic Capability:** All great dragons and some of the lesser dracoforms are magically active. They usually follow the shamanic tradition.
**Habits:** Dragons are most active at dawn and dusk, but they also operate in full daylight and in the dead of night. They feed on live prey of substantial size, cattle being a favorite food. They prefer to strike from the sky, swooping rapidly to carry off its victim before consuming it. Their lairs are caverns in unpopulated areas, which are often accessible only from the air. The dragon's aerial hunting pattern allows it to range more than 200 kilometers from its lair. A dragon's life expectancy is unknown, though it is believed to be very long indeed. Its breeding habits are also unknown.
**Young:** Paranaturalists believe that dragons are oviparous, but no nests have been discovered. Meridith Perkins has theorized that the lesser dracoforms are the young of the great dragons.
**Economic Value:** A worldwide black market deals in dragon body parts, which has led the Gewald Corporation to offer a bounty for the apprehension of any documented dragonslayer. We support this effort to prevent depletion of the population of these majestic creatures.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** All dracoforms exhibit a thermal sense unrelated to vision that is as effective as the thermographic vision of other Awakened forms. Dracoforms are also all capable of flight, in defiance of aerodynamic laws, as they appear to utilize some form of un- or subconscious magic in order to lift their mass.
**Common Powers:** Enhanced Senses (Wide-Band Hearing, Low-Light Vision, Thermal Sense)
**Powers Observed In Individuals:** Animal Control (Reptiles), Influence, Flame Projection, Noxious Breath, Venom

#### Eastern Dragon
*Draco orientalis*
**Identification:** The eastern dragon's head and body measure 15 meters. Its height at the shoulder is 2 meters, its tail is 15 meters long, and it weighs 7,500 kilograms. It has a serpentine or lizard-shape, with a broad, low head adorned with a fringe of whiskers on the chin and along the rear portions of the skull. Pairs of horns rise from behind the eyes, and a pair of barbules descend from beneath the pronounced nasal region. Scaly armor covers the body, neck, and tail, which are surmounted by a ridge of membrane-connected spines. The highly dexterous paws are four-fingered, with each digit ending in a large claw; captive specimens have been taught to handle fragile porcelain vases without mishap. The commonest pattern of eastern dragon coloration is iridescent green with golden whiskers and belly scutes, but other color patterns are known. The eastern dragon's skull has 40 teeth.
**Similar Species:** The sirrush (not included in this selection), indigenous to Asia Minor, appears quite similar, but its limbs are longer and its tail shorter. Its head is narrower and deeper, and it lacks whiskers and barbules. The digits of the sirrush's hind paws are all forward-facing and show limited dexterity, though the paw structure is reversed in the most famous ancient rendition of a sirrush, which is pictured on the Ishtar Gate.
**Habitat:** River valleys, mountains, and coastal cliffs

#### Feathered Serpents
*Alatuserpens Quetzalcoatlus*
**Identification:** Most feathered serpents are 20 meters in length from head to tail, have a wingspan of 15 meters, and weigh 6,000 kilograms. A feathered serpent is a long-bodied dracoform with one pair of wings and one pair of limbs. Its contour feathers and prominent feathered ruff are often a dazzling rainbow of colors. Membranes stretch between the extended finger bones of its large wings. Behind the wings are a pair of limbs that end in paws for ground locomotion. These feet have five digits, one of which is like an opposable thumb, giving it sufficient flexibility to manipulate objects. The skull contains 60 teeth. Some specimens have a tail spine connected to a poison sac, and some have a pair of fangs similarly equipped. The data gathered to date has been insufficient to determine whether such individuals represent a subspecies of Quetzalcoatlus, or a completely separate species of Alatuserpens.
**Similar Species:** Similar in form, shape, and habits, though unfeathered, is the common European wyvern (not included in this selection).
**Habitat:** Mountains, open forest, and grasslands

#### Western Dragon
*Draco occidentalis*
**Identification:** The western dragon's head and body are 20 meters long. It stands 3 meters at shoulder height, its tail is 17 meters long, and its wingspan is 30 meters. Its adult weight is about 2,000 kilograms. The western dragon has four limbs and a pair of wings. Its horned head is mounted at the end of a long neck. Only its forepaws exhibit the opposable digits and the dexterity of other dracoforms, with the hind paws adapted into feet. Dorsal spines and/or membranes may be present. The western dragon is usually a single color, though darker along the spine, with a pale belly. Some specimens have dermal armor formed of bony plates, in addition to the normal heavy scales. Others have small, non-overlapping scales that lend the appearance of smooth skin. The western dragon's skull has 40 teeth.
**Similar Species:** The common European wyvern (not included in this selection) is often mistaken for a western dragon, especially at a distance or in aerial maneuvers.
**Habitat:** Mountains, fens, bogs, and dense forests

#### Great Dragons
*Draco sapiens*
**Identification:** The great dragons are extremely large specimens, often up to 50 percent larger than typical lesser dragons. All the common dracoforms have great dragons among them. Size is usually the best indication that an individual is a great dragon, but it is not entirely reliable.
These creatures claim that they descend from a common lineage, though have provided no details or proof to back up the assertion. Therefore, despite the differences in their physical appearance, these rare and powerful creatures are grouped in a single entry. All great dragons are intelligent, being conversant in at least one human language and often many. They are also all magicians of great power.
**Habitat:** Wherever desired
**Known Great Dragons:**
* Aden, a sirrush, was responsible for demolishing Teheran in 2020, after the ruling ayatollah declared a jihad against the Awakened. Aden is believed to be currently lairing on Mount Ararat.
* Dunkelzahn, a western dragon, is the source of much of the information given here. Shortly after its first appearance, it granted interviews to a panel of media, including Holly Brighton, in return for a substantial portion of the revenue from the interview disks. Since then, Dunkelzahn has retired to the Rocky Mountains, where it lairs in Lake Louise and controls the surrounding area as a private feudal domain.
* Hualpa, a feathered serpent, is leader and spokescreature of the Awakened forces responsible for creating Amazonia. It is believed to be currently lairing in the Yucatan.
* Lofwyr, a western dragon, bought a controlling interest in Saeder-Krupp Heavy Industries with a massive lump of gold that had been part of its hoard. From that time, Lofwyr has pursued a program of corporate acquisition, so that its diversified holdings are now a major economic force. The full extent of this dragon's financial empire is unknown, as information on its assets is carefully guarded. It is believed to be currently lairing in Tir Taimgire.
* Lung, an eastern dragon, was involved in several Tong wars in the decades following the Awakening, sponsoring factions with monetary and magical support. Its current whereabouts are unknown.
* Ryumyo, an eastern dragon, became the first dragon sighted by humans on December 24, 2011, in the vicinity of Mount Fuji. After two further confirmed sightings at Ise and Kyoto, it disappeared.
* Sirrurg, a western dragon, is believed to be responsible for the loss of EuroAir Flight 329 in 2041. It has been identified in several attacks against corporate and government holdings in Europe and may have participated in the coup establishing Amazonia. Its present whereabouts are unknown.

### ELEMENTAL SPIRITS
*Anima hermetica*

**Identification:** Elemental spirits are embodiments of the classical elements. Each type's appearance is peculiar to its element, with the size of its manifestation almost always indicative of its power.
**Habitat:** Wherever conjured, which is easiest near a concentration of its element.
**Commentary:** Elemental spirits are the forces of the magical elements (fire, water, air, and earth) engendered into seemingly self-aware entities. They exist primarily in astral space.
Each type of elemental has special powers and weaknesses. Each is subject to annihilation by contact with an opposing elemental of equal or greater power, during which the stronger elemental is weakened by the power of the other as well. Fire opposes water, and air opposes earth. All elementals can manifest physically.

**Air Spirit**
* **Appearance:** An air spirit appears as a swirling, smoky shape of vaguely humanoid form.
* **Powers:** Engulf, Manifest Form, Movement, Noxious Breath, Psychokinesis
* **Weaknesses:** An air spirit may be confined by airtight seals in containers of remarkably small size; Vulnerability (Earth).

**Earth Spirit**
* **Appearance:** An Earth spirit appears as a chunky, humanoid shape of earth and/or rock.
* **Powers:** Engulf, Manifest Form, Movement
* **Weaknesses:** Vulnerability (Air)

**Fire Spirit**
* **Appearance:** A fire spirit appears as a reddish-orange, lizard-like creature sheathed in an aura of flames.
* **Powers:** Engulf, Fire Aura, Fire Projection (always sustained without causing Drain), Guard, Manifestation
* **Weaknesses:** Vulnerability (Water)

**Water Spirit**
* **Appearance:** A water spirit appears as a mass of murky water of indefinite, ever-shifting shape.
* **Powers:** Engulf, Manifestation, Movement
* **Weaknesses:** Vulnerability (Fire)

---

### EYEKILLERS
*Bubovermis fulminis*

**Identification:** The typical eyekiller's overall length is 7 meters, its height at the shoulder is 2.5 meters, and its weight is 200 kilograms. An eyekiller's body tapers from its large head to its thick tail. Its eyes are enormous. The head is covered in contour feathers that form a sound-conducting pattern that aid the creature in hunting, resembling a feature known in owls. The feathers are hairier below the shoulders and become a furry pelt over the limbs and snake-like body. The eyekiller's feathers are commonly gray or brown. The single pair of limbs end in feet with four clawed digits. The skull is beaked.
**Habitat:** Deserts and chaparral
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** Nocturnal. The eyekiller feeds on many species. It prefers hunting to scavenging. The female nests in burrows dug into the ground, often near piles of stone that the creature constructs itself. Eyekillers mate for life and hunt in pairs. Its life expectancy is ten years in captivity, seven years in the wild. Its breeding season is in mid-spring.
**Young:** The female eyekiller lays eggs in pairs. The young emerge from the burrow three weeks after hatching.
**Range:** Western North America
**Commentary:** The eyekiller generates an electrical impulse strong enough to stun a strong man or cause cardiac arrest in a weak or sickly individual.
**Powers:** Electrical Projection, Enhanced Senses (Low-Light Vision; Amplified Hearing)

---

### GHOSTS
*Larva valida*

**Identification:** The existence of ghosts has been proven beyond any doubt since the second decade of this century. Though hauntings are extremely rare, and debate rages about the survival of consciousness after death, haunting phenomena cannot be denied.
In every case, a ghost is an image of a dead human or metahuman. Individuals who die unexpectedly, yet are aware of their deaths, may become ghosts. Someone who dies under overwhelming psychic pressure, such as an undischarged obligation or unfulfilled need, may also become a ghost.
There are two known classes of ghost: **apparitions** and **specters**.
**Habitat:** Apparitions generally haunt either the place where the individual died or his former earthly home. Specters can appear wherever they wish, but most haunt a specific place or attach themselves to an individual or a family. Specters are often hostile, causing poltergeist phenomena that can injure or even kill, but some act as protective spirits that watch over family members or descendants.
**Habits:** Apparitions appear only as illusions. They are almost always visible, usually audible, and may affect other senses with ghostly touches, cold chills, faint odors, and so on. They may frighten the onlooker, but apparently cannot cause physical harm or any other lasting effect on reality. They are usually generated upon the death of someone with an overpowering need to communicate some information to the living world.
Apparitions are frequently associated with violent death. Their behavior tends to be repetitious of the actions that led up to the death of the ghost's once-living counterpart.
Specters are more independent in actions than apparitions. They can affect the physical plane, and most display a personality-a strong argument that they are the surviving spirits of deceased persons-but others show little individuality at all. A specter's true form is that of the deceased, but it can usually assume any appearance desired. Hostile specters seem to delight in assuming grotesque, frightening shapes.
Specters may, like apparitions, be motivated by a desire to communicate with the living. On the other hand, they may also have a more concrete motivation, such as seeking revenge for murder or some other injustice, protecting their surviving family, or satisfying other psychological motivations of the deceased.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Some schools of thought maintain that a ghost has the actual consciousness, or even the "soul," of the deceased. According to these theories, a ghost refuses to acknowledge its own death, and the spirit cannot rest until exorcised by a magician (using conjuring), or until some set of conditions is fulfilled.
A less mystical theory maintains that a ghost is an illusion created by the mind of the deceased, but that it does not actually partake of his or consciousness. The psychic pressure at the time of death forms the ghost from magical energy and programs it with its motivations. The strength of this mana-manipulation determines the power and behavior of the ghost.
Though ghostly evidence is not admitted in a court of law, a detective-mage tracked down a serial killer in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2039 after studying an apparition of one of the killer's victims. The ghost's actions revealed sources of evidence that led to the murderer's arrest and conviction.
**Specter Powers:** Fear, Manifestation, Psychokinesis. Incidents involving Compulsion (to repeat acts of the deceased), Noxious Breath, and Paralyzing Touch have been reported, but remain unverified.

### GHOULS
*Manesphagus horridus*

**Identification:** Ghouls commonly stand 1.7 meters tall and weigh 78 kilograms. They are a goblinized form of human or metahuman. The change results in a rough, scabrous hide and the loss of all body hair. Skin coloration varies from dead-white to ashen gray, depending on the ghoul's original ethnic group. The fingers of a ghoul's hand elongate and its nails harden into claws. Its skull has slightly enlarged jaws that contain 28 teeth. These are modified to a consistent jagged shape. The females have two mammae.
**Similar Species:** Despite the ghoul's preference for human flesh, this creature is obviously different from the wendigo (p. 232).
**Habitat:** Crypts, abandoned properties near graveyards, and densely populated slums
**Magic Capability:** Normally innate, but some individuals are magically active.
**Habits:** Nocturnal. A ghoul feeds on dead animals, usually humans. Its diet and sanitary habits often result in a nauseating odor that emanates from the creature's pores. If no suitable building is available, the ghoul will often dig its own burrow. Though usually found in packs of 6 to 20, some ghouls wander alone. Such specimens tend to be extremely aggressive and have greater-than-average physical characteristics. A ghoul's life expectancy is similar to its subspecies of origin. Its breeding season is unrestricted.
**Young:** One (rare)
**Economic Value:** Most governments offer a bounty on ghouls. Many jurisdictions also make any commerce with or aid to a ghoul punishable by fine, imprisonment, re-education, or even death.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Many ghouls, though suffering from goblinization trauma and possibly loss of mental capacity, remain thinking creatures capable of using whatever technology they can acquire. City-dwelling ghouls often mask their odor with perfumes.
**Powers:** Enhanced Senses (Smell, Hearing)
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Moderate); Reduced Senses (Blind or nearly so)

### GRIFFIN
*Alatusleo aquila*

**Identification:** The griffin's head and body are 3 meters long. It stands 1.6 meters tall at the shoulders, its tail is 1.3 meters long, and it has a wingspan of 7 meters. It weighs 150 kilograms. The griffin is a large, winged quadruped. Most griffins have golden-brown feathers on their wings and foreparts, with lightly furred hindparts, though some varieties have white-feathered heads and necks. The sharply hooked beak is bright yellow or occasionally bright red. The forelimbs are scaled and end in four toes, each equipped with a sharp black talon. The skull is beaked. There are no mammae.
**Similar Species:** The Asian griffin (*Alatusleo serpens*) differs primarily in the head and neck, which are smooth-skinned or scaled. The Asian griffin also has a distinctive series of membrane-connected spines running along the back of its neck. The opinicus, or false griffin (*Opinicus falciform*), is quite similar to the common griffin, except that it has no wings. It also lacks the large, tufted external ears of the common griffin.
**Habitat:** Mountains, usually near steppes or open plains
**Habits:** Griffins are active in daylight, mostly near dawn and dusk. Their favorite food is horse meat, though cattle and other livestock are regularly taken. They nest in mountain clefts or on pinnacles. A griffin's hunting territory is more than 100 kilometers in diameter. The longest-surviving specimen in captivity is at least 30 years old. Its life expectancy in the wild is unknown. Its breeding season is early summer.
**Young:** The female griffin lays one to four eggs, only one of which is likely to hatch. The parents feed the newly hatched in the nest until about two months after the youngs' first flight, which is usually about four months after hatching.
**Economic Value:** In areas where griffins become so plentiful that they prove a serious threat to livestock, governments sometimes offer a bounty on them. These governments usually require that the hunter produce the beak as proof of the kill. There is a thriving market-open in some countries, black market in others-in griffin feathers and hides.
**Range:** Northern hemisphere
**Commentary:** Like most large, flying Awakened creatures, the griffin is believed to use magic to counter its mass.

### HARPY
*Harpyia gregaria*

**Identification:** The harpy stands only 1.2 meters tall, has a tail 1 meter long, and weighs about 560 kilograms. It is a flying mammal rather than a bird-human mixture, with fur and bat-like wings, unlike its namesake in Greek mythology. Its head is curiously shaped, with an expression resembling a human face distorted with rage. Its color ranges from light brown to almost black. Its skull has 28 teeth. All specimens of harpy encountered to date have been female, with two mammae.
**Similar Species:** The harpy is almost certainly an Awakened bat-form rather than a metahuman species, though some debate continues on this point. Small specimens have been mistaken for the giant vampire bat (*Desmodus giganteus*) of South America (not included in this selection) and the rare "flying wolf" (*Pteropus carnivorus*) of southeast Asia (not included in this selection).
**Habitat:** The harpy prefers elevated sites for nesting, but is otherwise unrestricted.
**Habits:** Active by day, the harpy feeds on small birds and mammals, but prefers carrion when available. It nests near favorite food sources such as garbage dumps, and ranges up to fifty kilometers from its nest. Harpies aggregate in communities of up to 100 individuals. A harpy may live 20 years in captivity, but only 5 to 10 years in the wild. Breeding season is unrestricted, but details on the harpy's mating habits are lacking.
**Young:** The harpy mother lays one to two dozen soft-shelled eggs, which hatch in 2 to 5 days. The young remain in the nest for 12 to 14 months of maturation, at first suckling the mother and then eating scraps of food brought by her.
**Economic Value:** Governments frequently offer a small bounty on these vermin.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** The greatest mystery about harpies is how they breed, as no males of the species have ever been sighted.
**Powers:** Pestilence

---

### KRAKEN
*Architeuthis megagiganteus*

**Identification:** The combined head and body length of the kraken averages 25 meters. The kraken has a hydrodynamically streamlined body and ten ordinary and two elongated tentacles, the latter widening at the ends to form oval pads. The length of the ordinary tentacles is 30 meters and the elongated tentacles 40 meters; the creature's total weight is estimated at more than 30 tons. The creature has some limited color-changing ability, but is basically white with dark blue or brown mottling on its dorsal surfaces. The skull is composed of calcium carbonate and has a horny central beak.
**Similar Species:** The kraken is frequently mistaken for the common giant squid (*Architeuthis princeps*).
**Habitat:** Pelagic ocean
**Habits:** The kraken is drawn to the lights of ships and ocean platforms, despite an aversion to sunlight that prevents it from appearing on the surface other than at night. It is involved in a predator-prey relationship with beaked whales, in which each seems to be the favorite food of the other. No specimen of kraken has ever been held captive.
**Young:** Unknown
**Economic Value:** Sony Biotech and other biotechnical corporations have offered bounties for intact specimens with undamaged skins.
**Range:** Worldwide

---

### LESHY
*Incola silvestris*

**Identification:** The average leshy's height is 1.5 meters. Its tail is .1 meter long, and it weighs 60 kilograms. Leshy are humanoid, though their habit of wearing garments of leaves and moss often makes them appear half vegetable. Their skin is dark and rough, with sparse body hair that is often green-tinged by a harmless algae. The skull has 24 teeth. The female leshy has two mammae.
**Habitat:** Forests
**Magic Capability:** A significantly higher proportion of the leshy population is more magically active than most other metahumanoid species. Leshy magicians are usually shamans. They seem to have additional advantages with forest spirits (+1 die for leshy dealing with forest spirits).
**Habits:** Capable of activity at all hours, leshy are most active during the early and late portions of the day. They are good climbers and leapers, often taking to the trees to avoid predators or pursuit. Leshy are vegetarians, feeding on fruits and vegetables native to the forest. They nest in hollow trees, in natural or modified windfalls, and in abandoned shelters or buildings. They range up to five kilometers from their nests. The basic social units are small family groups that maintain cordial, if distant, relations with other families whose range abuts theirs. Isolated individuals are quite common. Breeding season is unrestricted.
**Young:** One
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Leshy are exceedingly territorial. Their familiarity with their home range enables them to move through it with almost supernatural speed. They resent intrusions into their range, and set traps to impede anyone passing through. When aroused to anger, they construct deadfalls, spiked pits, and torsion-powered impalement devices, which encourage trespassers to seek alternate routes.
**Powers:** Confusion

---

### MERROW
*Merhomo marina*

**Identification:** A merrow is 3 meters tall and weighs 500 kilograms. Its forelimbs are long and end in two three-fingered hands with opposable thumbs. Rudimentary hind limbs mark the junction of the long, tapering torso and the slender but strong tail. A long mane covers the neck, and a series of extended spinal vertebrae run the length of the torso. The rear half of the body is armored by dermal bone, but the tail remains remarkably flexible. The body coloration is light and usually has a greenish tinge, except for the dermal bone's darker emerald or deep blue-green. The merrow's ears are external and elongated to points. It has red eyes and a short-snouted skull containing 36 teeth. The females have two mammae.
**Similar Species:** Various pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) are commonly mistaken for this elusive creature.
**Habitat:** Coastal waters
**Magic Capability:** This is normally innate, but evidence of magically active individuals indicates that merrow are a sentient species.
**Habits:** Merrow congregate in polygamous family groups and associations. They feed on fish and mollusks, with a preference for squid. A merrow swims with an undulating motion, using its limbs for fine directional control, and can achieve remarkably high speeds. They breathe air, but have been observed to stay submerged for prolonged periods, leading to speculation that they possess innate magical ability to extract oxygen from water. Their breeding season is unrestricted.
**Young:** One or two
**Economic Value:** Merrow are responsible for damage to commercial fishing operations.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Paranaturalists argue whether the merrow can be considered sapient. The creature has been observed using tools such as nets of seaweed and spears, and using digging and prying tools to collect and open mollusks. There are also unsubstantiated reports of merrow using manufactured items. Indeed, paranaturalist Meridith Perkins, a noted advocate of classifying the species as sapient, maintains that she has observed members of one community consistently gut and clean prey with knives of high-density plastic.

### NAGA
*Custos serpens*

**Identification:** The naga is 10 meters long and weighs 300 kilograms. It has the form of a great serpent, but with an enlarged head containing 28 teeth. Coloration is highly variable, but is almost always a multicolored pattern that fades toward the pale underbelly.
**Similar Species:** Without a good view of the head, it is easy to mistake a naga for an anaconda or a python.
**Habitat:** Tropical forests
**Magical Capability:** Innate, with some evidence of spellcasting ability
**Habits:** The naga becomes inactive in periods of extreme heat or prolonged cold. It eats small mammals, and dens in rocky crevices or human-built structures. Though normally solitary, naga may be found in groups of up to two dozen, especially in colder climes during periods of low activity and in all climates during the mating season. The longest-lived naga specimen in captivity is at least 32 years old. Breeding occurs in early spring.
**Young:** Three to five young are born live, and they immediately leave the mother's protection.
**Economic Value:** Young naga can be trained to accept human handlers, thus allowing their strong territorial instincts to be used in security details.
**Range:** The naga's original range was sub-Saharan Africa, southern Asia, and Indonesia. Transport by humans has distributed them in tropical zones worldwide.
**Commentary:** The naga is more intelligent than other reptiles. The creature can learn various behaviors ranging from verbal and somatic cues to sophisticated activities in very short periods of time. Its spellcasting ability strongly argues that the naga should be rated as sentient. The Committee for the Recognition of Awakened Intelligence has a petition seeking international recognition of the naga as a sapient life form pending before the United Nations. It also calls for sanctions against nations and corporations that employ nagas, on the grounds of involuntary servitude.
**Powers:** Guard, Magical Guard, Venom

### NATURE SPIRITS
*Anima naturalis*

**Identification:** Nature spirits rarely appear in any fixed form. When they do manifest, it is often in a form that reflects their home terrain. If conjured by a shaman of great power, these spirits may appear in a shape somewhat similar to that of their summoner, but composed of the matter of their home terrain. The Spirits of Man are the major exception to this rule, as they usually assume humanoid form. The ancient legends of "brownies" are probably memories of these spirits' manifestations.
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habitat:** Nature spirits can only exist in their home terrain. They cannot be summoned anywhere else, nor will they obey orders that send them from home. Thus, a sea spirit will not move onto land, a prairie spirit will not enter a forest, and so on.
**Commentary:** Nature spirits are the embodied forces of nature and of place, and the spirits of shamanic tradition. There are four classes of nature spirit: **Spirits of the Land** (forest, mountain, desert, prairie), **Spirits of the Waters** (sea, lake, river, swamp), **Spirits of the Winds** (storm, mist), and **Spirits of Man** (city, field, hearth).

**City Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Alienation, Concealment, Confusion, Fear, Guard, Search
* **Appearance:** Varies widely. City spirits usually appear as small pieces of litter or amorphous masses of garbage. There is, however, a documented case of a spirit in San Francisco that appeared in the form of a cable car, and a shaman in Seattle recently claimed that he conjured a spirit that took the form of a 1947 Hudson automobile.

**Desert Spirit**
* **Powers:** Concealment, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** Desert spirits appear initially in the form of small dust devils that, if ordered to attack, grow into raging sandstorms.

**Field Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Concealment, Guard, Search
* **Special Power:** Field spirits can improve the fertility of crops and livestock. Conversely, they can also damage crop or ranch yield.
* **Appearance:** Field spirits take the form of miniature farmhands dressed in overalls, bandanas, and so on. Reports of field spirits wearing chaps, ten-gallon hats, and elaborate cowboy boots in the North American Southwest remain unverified at this time.

**Forest Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Concealment, Confusion, Fear, Guard
* **Appearance:** Forest spirits rarely manifest visibly. When they do, they appear as deeper pools of shadow among the trees. If a shaman orders them to take a more solid shape, they become vaguely humanoid trees, capable of movement, with great, knobby, branch-like limbs.

**Hearth Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Alienation, Concealment, Confusion, Guard, Search
* **Appearance:** Hearth spirits often resemble small, bearded humanoids wearing antique clothing.

**Lake Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Engulf, Fear, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** Lake spirits usually appear as an area of ripples upon the water. If the shaman conjures them into more solid form, they will appear as humanoids dripping with moss and weed, rising from the water.

**Mist Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Concealment, Confusion, Guard, Movement
* **Appearance:** Mist spirits have no material form, appearing only as swirling clouds of fog.

**Mountain Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Concealment, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** Mountain spirits rarely have physical manifestations. Their arrival is marked by an utter stillness and an oppressive, invisible presence. If forced into visibility, the mountain spirit becomes a craggy humanoid of apparently living rock, which despite its small size, has an aura of enormous mass.

**Prairie Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Alienation, Concealment, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** Prairie spirits typically appear as erratically moving tumbleweeds or small dust devils. Reports of miniature riders resembling nomadic human types such as Mongols and Amerindians are under investigation.

**River Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Concealment, Engulf, Fear, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** River spirits usually appear as small whirlpools, but under constraint, they may appear as small, frog-like, weed-draped humanoids.

**Sea Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Alienation, Concealment, Confusion, Engulf, Fear, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** Sea spirits usually appear as anomalous surfaces on the water: choppy waves in a calm sea and tranquil patches in a choppy sea. If forced to take on a more solid form, they resemble merfolk, mythical creatures with humanoid upper bodies and hind bodies of fish.

**Storm Spirit**
* **Powers:** Concealment, Confusion, Electrical Projection, Fear
* **Appearance:** Storm spirits initially manifest as cold, damp presences. When conjured with strength, they appear as roiling thunderclouds or whirlwinds. Undocumented manifestations as an eagle in the western portion of North America and a red-bearded giant in a goat-drawn chariot in northern Europe have also been reported. (Accounts of winged humanoids with bowling balls can be safely discounted.)

**Swamp Spirit**
* **Powers:** Accident, Binding, Concealment, Confusion, Engulf, Fear, Guard, Movement, Search
* **Appearance:** A swamp spirit typically manifests as a flickering ball of light, and they are believed to be the source of the will-o'-the-wisp legends. Magicians have occasionally reported swamp spirits manifesting as moss-hung trees or rotting masses of vegetation that might only be called humanoid out of charity.

### PHOENIX
*Phoenix aureus*

**Identification:** With a wingspan of 4 meters, a height of 1.3 meters, a tail 2 meters long, and weighing 20 kilograms, the phoenix is a large bird. It has strong, graceful wings and long, flowing tail feathers. Its crested head has golden plumage. Its body feathers are iridescent red and shimmering purple, and its tail is a glittering array of azure shades. The skull has a sharply hooked beak.
**Similar Species:** The phoenix is occasionally confused with specimens of thunderbirds that have long, colorful tails.
**Habitat:** Open woodlands
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** The phoenix is a diurnal creature that feeds on small mammals and birds. It nests on the ground in rocky areas, and will defend its nest fiercely. The creature can live up to 20 years in captivity. Its breeding season is in early spring.
**Young:** The phoenix lays one or two eggs, which hatch in three weeks. Hatchlings remain in the nest to be fed by both parents until fledged. After the young depart, the parent birds immolate the nest.
**Economic Value:** Phoenix feathers are prized in many parts of the world. The editors of the *Paterson Field Guide Series* urge purchasers to verify that feathers were obtained from molt rather than slaughter.
**Range:** Eastern Asia and North Africa
**Powers:** Flame Aura

---

### SASQUATCH
*Pesvastus pilosis*

**Identification:** The sasquatch stands 2.9 meters and weighs 110 kilograms. It is a dark-skinned, upright biped with large feet. Its black or dark brown body hair is double-layered, though the hair may be silver-tipped, especially on the upper back and head of older individuals. The sasquatch can mimic a variety of sounds, including the hunting calls of other creatures. Its ears are small, often disappearing under the head hair, but its nose is prominent and flared. The sasquatch skull has 28 teeth and the female has 2 mammae.
**Similar Species:** The sasquatch is often confused by the uninitiated with the leshy (p. 227), though there is little resemblance save in habits and habitat. More serious identification problems arise with large, hairy specimens of ork and hairy trolls, who have done much to malign the reputation of this gentle forest creature. Occasional sightings of white-furred humanoids in the lower reaches of the Himalayas and nearby mountain ranges have prompted paranaturalists to posit an Asian form (*Pesvastus asiaticus*), commonly referred to as a yeti (not included in this selection).
**Habitat:** Forested regions
**Magic Capability:** Sasquatches are presumed to be magically active, most likely as shamans.
**Habits:** The sasquatch is active at all times. Its way of life is similar to that of the gorilla (believed now extinct in the wild). It is vegetarian, peaceful, and curious. It fights only when attacked, though it demonstrates elaborate threat behavior. The observer is warned to be cautious, however, for sasquatches have been known to interpret sudden movement on the part of a threatened individual as an imminent attack. The creatures live in small family groups, though individuals may range far from the group while foraging. Sasquatches nest permanently in groves or caverns, but sometimes prepare temporary nests in thickets when traveling at a distance from the home nest. Life expectancy is believed to be more than 40 years. The breeding season is unrestricted.
**Young:** One, occasionally two. Parental care continues for 24 to 30 months.
**Range:** Northern portions of North America
**Commentary:** The sasquatch was recognized by the United Nations in 2042 as a sentient species, despite its lack of a material culture and the inability of scientists to decipher its language. This decision ended years of imprisonment and exhibition of sasquatch individuals. Development of the Perkins-Athapascan sign language has allowed limited communication with sasquatches. Today, they can be found colonizing forests in Awakened lands worldwide and serving as sound effects technicians in the entertainment industry.

### SHAPESHIFTER
*Bestiaforma mutabilis*

**Identification:** Variable. In animal form, a shapeshifter manifests as a large, well-formed member of its species, often with dramatic coloration. In human form, a shapeshifter is usually very attractive, but with vestiges of its bestial nature. Viewing the shapeshifter in astral space will reveal its identity, as its alternate form is always visible there.
**Habitat:** The shapeshifter lives in its animal form in the wild. In its human form, it lives as a member of the community.
**Magic Capability:** Many are active, with potential innate in all others.
**Habits:** Shapeshifters are capable of activity at all times, but many forms prefer a nocturnal life. Despite many myths to the contrary, shapeshifters are not locked into the cycles of the moon, though many seem to prefer their animal form during the full moon. It is also a myth that they shed their skins in order to become human. Shapeshifters are usually carnivorous, but show no difficulty maintaining an omnivorous diet while in human form. They breed according to the season of their animal form.
**Young:** Shapeshifters are born in animal form, in numbers typical for the animal. Some of the litter may not be shapeshifters.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** All shapeshifters display a severe allergic reaction to silver. It is a common misconception that shapeshifters are humans that change into animals. That is not true: shapeshifters begin their lives as animals, and remain animals that turn into humans. Their personalities and points of view are unique.
**Powers:** Enhanced Physical Attributes in animal form, Regeneration
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Silver, Severe), Vulnerability (Silver)

**Common Shapeshifters**
* **Bear**
    * **Origin:** Northern hemisphere
    * **Identifying Feature:** Extensive body hair
    * **Active Magic:** Rare
* **Fox**
    * **Origin:** Japan and China
    * **Identifying Feature:** Long tail
    * **Active Magic:** Common
* **Leopard**
    * **Origin:** Africa
    * **Identifying Feature:** Enlarged canines
    * **Active Magic:** Common
* **Seal**
    * **Origin:** Coastal waters worldwide
    * **Identifying Feature:** Webbed toes, possibly fingers
    * **Active Magic:** Common
* **Tiger**
    * **Origin:** Asia
    * **Identifying Feature:** Reflective eyes
    * **Active Magic:** Rare
* **Wolf**
    * **Origin:** Northern hemisphere
    * **Identifying Feature:** Hairy palms, eyebrows that meet in the middle
    * **Active Magic:** Uncommon

---

### THUNDERBIRD
*Avesfulmen splendidus*

**Identification:** The thunderbird's head and body measure 3 meters, its tail 1 meter, and its wingspan 10 meters. It weighs 100 kilograms. An eagle-like bird, its head, neck, and tail are usually covered with white feathers, but in some specimens these areas are darker. Its torso and the upper wing surfaces range from golden to dark brown. The wing undersurfaces are cream-colored. The skull has a sharply hooked beak.
**Similar Species:** The considerably larger roc (not included in this section) is often confused with the thunderbird in aerial encounters where nothing is present to give a perspective on size.
**Habitat:** Mountains
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** The thunderbird is usually active during the day, but reports also indicate nocturnal activity. Thunderbirds hunt terrestrial animals such as antelope and deer, as well as scavenging carrion. They nest in sheltered spots near mountain peaks and may travel hundreds of kilometers from their nest in search of prey. Their breeding season is early summer.
**Young:** The female thunderbird lays one or two eggs, which hatch in six weeks. Hatchlings remain in the nest for three to six weeks.
**Range:** Western hemisphere
**Powers:** Electrical Projection (With area effect)

---

### UNICORN
*Unicornis validus*

**Identification:** The unicorn's head and body are 3 meters long, and its height at the shoulder is 1.4 meters. It weighs 370 kilograms. To all appearances, a unicorn is a horse with a single, spiral horn. It has a long, flowing mane and tail. Coloration is usually white, but all typical horse colors and patterns have been observed. Its skull has 40 teeth, and females have 4 mammae.
**Similar Species:** Many other ungulates have produced unicornate paraspecies. Most common of these are the red deer unicorn of Europe, the goat unicorn of Africa and Asia Minor, and the rare water buffalo unicorn of China and southeast Asia, which often has dermal armor and may be the basis of the legendary chi'lin and kirin (not included in this selection).
**Habitat:** Grasslands
**Magic Capability:** Innate
**Habits:** Unicorns are active by day, feed on grasses, and keep harems (if male) or stud groups (if female) of horses. The unicorn may range far afield from its herd for extended periods of time. They live less than a year in captivity, but more than 25 years in the wild. The breeding season is unrestricted.
**Young:** One, or twins in rare cases. Not all births are destined to become unicorns. If a colt is to be unicornate, the horn emerges at maturity (about two years), and continues to grow, ever more slowly, throughout the creature's life.
**Economic Value:** Unicorn horns are prized in many parts of the world for medicinal and magical preparations, many of dubious value.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Powers:** Immunity (Pathogens), Magical Guard
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Pollutants, Severe)

---

### VAMPIRE
*Sanguisuga europa*

**Identification:** Vampires are externally identical to humans or metahumans, though there is enlargement of the upper canines in most individuals. Vampires are detectable biochemically by the Harz-Greenbaum blood series, or virologically by testing for the presence of the Human-Metahuman Vampiric Virus (HMHVV). Vampires are not a true species, but rather they are individuals of a human subspecies who have been infected with an agent that causes the vampiric condition. The infection only seems to reach its full virulence in a magic-rich environment, but there are indications that both virus and vampires were present before the Awakening.
**Similar Species:** Other possibly related expressions of the HMHVV retrovirus are the paraspecies of banshee (p. 221) and wendigo (p. 232).
**Habitat:** Vampires prey on sentient beings, and so are usually urban dwellers.
**Magic Capability:** Latent. Active magic is much commoner in humans infected with the virus than among the uninfected. It is unknown whether this is due to side effects of the virus or preferential selection of magic-capable individuals by its carriers. Vampires absorb the life essence of their victims. With their prolonged life span, they have the potential to become powerful magicians. It seems likely that legends of vampiric powers are based on the magical prowess of individual vampires.
**Habits:** The vampire consumes the blood of the living to survive, but also must consume psychic energy along with the blood.
**Range:** Worldwide
**Commentary:** Though case histories are often vague, not all vampires fit the stereotype of unrelenting bloodsucker. Many prefer willing partners, and do not drain Essence from a subject more than once. Only when a partner freely accepts the transition to the vampiric life will such a vampire "kill." Other vampires revel in their role as hunters and killers. Such individuals have a strong sadistic streak and seek out unwilling victims. Initially, the vampire draws sustenance from the victim's terror. Then, if the early attacks have not killed the victim, the vampire will enjoy taking the now-addicted subject's final Essence. Such individuals may have been psychopaths before their transition to vampirism, or it may be the shock of their death and rebirth as a "hunting creature" that pushes them over the edge. These are the monsters of the vampire horror stories made popular over the years. There have also been cases where a vampire has destroyed the victim's body after draining his or her Essence, and thereby prevented a new vampire from taking up its new life.
**Powers:** Enhanced Physical Characteristics, Enhanced Senses (Hearing and Smell), Essence Drain, Immunity (Age, Poison, Pathogens), Infection, Mist Form, Regeneration, Thermographic Vision
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Severe), Induced Dormancy (Lack of air), Essence Loss, Vulnerability (Wood), and in some, a psychologically based Allergy (Holy symbols, Severe). Though many of the legendary weaknesses of vampires are not genuine, they do have certain limitations. They do not need food or drink other than blood, but neither can they comfortably ingest anything else. Within a few minutes after eating or drinking, a vampire will evidence obvious distress and will vomit within an hour. Alcohol is particularly distasteful to them, as it causes nausea and vomiting within minutes. Vampires have less buoyancy than other humanoid beings (+3 to target numbers of all Skill or Attribute Tests when swimming, trying to stay afloat, and so on). This is presumably the basis for their legendary vulnerability to running water. A vampire can hop across a stream with no difficulty, but if one falls into a lake, it will probably go under, forcing dormancy.

---

### WENDIGO
*Anthrophagus pilosis*

**Identification:** The wendigo's height is 2.5 meters and its weight is 130 kilograms. It is a white-furred, upright biped. The nails of its hands are elongated and hardened into claw-like weapons. Many paranaturalists believe that this creature is the result of the HMHVV retrovirus in orks, though no specimens have been tested for presence of the virus. Its skull has 28 teeth. The females have two mammae.
**Similar Species:** Though the fur and physiognomy of the wendigo are radically different from that of the sasquatch, the wendigo is often mistaken for a sasquatch (p. 230), usually by persons not native to the region of sighting.
**Habitat:** Forests
**Magic Capability:** Most are magically active
**Habits:** The wendigo is most active at night. It feeds on flesh, and is believed to derive psychic sustenance from its victim. Typically, it induces a victim to partake of a cannibalistic feast. This seems to create a psychological dependence on such meat in the victim, who begins to aid the wendigo in spreading its habits, thus creating a coven or secret society of cannibals. The members of the coven are unaware that they will ultimately be meals for the wendigo itself, which seems to prefer the essence of such corrupted spirits. The wendigo makes its lair in the abode of a previous victim. Its life expectancy is unknown.
**Young:** Paranaturalists suspect that the wendigo breeds similarly to the vampire, transmitting the HMHVV virus rather than procreating.
**Range:** Originally the northern portions of North America and Asia as well as the transpolar regions. Recent reports indicate that it has spread worldwide, leading paranaturalists to suspect that it can maintain a mask spell in addition to its other powers.
**Commentary:** All known wendigos have been active shamanic magicians. Though most carried fetishes of predatory totems such as the shark or wolf, some had items of unidentified affiliations. All civilized regions outlaw the wendigo, making it subject to an automatic death penalty if convicted of anthropophageous activity. Aiding and abetting a wendigo usually carries a similar sentence. Many jurisdictions offer a bounty on the creature.
**Powers:** Influence, Enhanced Physical Attributes, Enhanced Senses (Low-Light Vision and Visual Acuity; Hearing, Smell), Essence Drain, Fear, Immunity (Age, Pathogens, Poisons), Infection, Regeneration
**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Severe), Essence Loss, Vulnerability (Ferrous Metals)

### CRITTER STATISTICS
The following numbers represent a typical specimen. Individuals may vary, especially among sentient species. Physical and Mental Attributes of an individual may be 50 percent higher than those of an average specimen. A small individual will never have Attribute Ratings less than half those of the average unless it is sick or injured. Even in the largest and smallest specimens, Essence, reach, attack type, run multiplier, and damage modifiers remain the same.

### CRITTER STATISTICS TABLE KEY
* **B:** Body. The first number is the rating. The second is any "armor" for the critter, acting as composite ballistic and impact armor. Any variations of this will be listed with Powers.
* **Q:** Quickness. The first number is the rating. The second is the multiplier for running.
* **S:** Strength.
* **C:** Charisma.
* **I:** Intelligence. The first number is the critter's basic rating, used for puzzles and resisting some spells. The second number is its Perception Rating, used to detect prey or enemies when its best sense is working (sonar for bats, nose for dogs, and so forth).
* **W:** Willpower.
* **E:** Essence. If the number appears in parentheses, the critter has a dual nature. If a capital A follows the number, the critter exists primarily in astral space. Critters with variable Essence have a range of numbers.
* **R:** Reaction. Some critters' Reaction Rating is a function of their other Attributes, others have independent values. Critters whose Reaction Ratings are marked with an asterisk receive 2D6 Initiative dice. Those with two asterisks have 3D6 Initiative dice.
* **Attacks:** This lists the Attack Code for nonintelligent critters or the designation "humanoid" for those that can use weapons and follow the normal combat rules for characters. This column also tells which critters have extended reach.
