### COMMUNICATIONS GEAR

I've lost count of the runs I know of that got scragged up by botched communications. Get yourselves a decent headware comm setup: multi-channel, with signal compression/decompression for burst transmissions and hot-wire encryption/decryption to keep the corpers from listening in. A subvocal microphone and subdermal speakers are another must, if you want to keep Mr. Public from overhearing your nattering. Stay away from those fraggin' headset microphone combinations—any old joker can grab onto those and yank you around. Not too inconspicuous, either—a bad move in our line of work.

The best option is a pure cybernetic rig a cybercomm link that works pretty much like telepathy.

**Subvocal Microphones** The external unit straps in place at the center of the throat. Either type of microphone adds a +4 modifier to the target number for **Perception Tests** made to overhear conversations using the system. Both units can connect to an external radio transceiver, the external unit via fiber-optic cable and the Internal via a datajack (mandatory for such a hookup).

**Subdermal Speakers** Usually mounted under the skin just behind the ear, these tiny speakers vibrate various bones in the ear to transmit sound. Sound coming over them cannot be overheard.

**Cybercomm Link** The cybercomm link consists of a transducer and a radio transmitter. The transducer translates thoughts into words, so that the user need not speak aloud; the transmitter sends and receives these unspoken impulses. No external evidence of this system's use is visible or audible. Quadruples the number of spoken words allowed in a Free Action (p. 81, SRII).

### CYBEREYES

I've had cybereyes awhile, and so do more folks than you might think. The top sellers are made to look real, so they're tough to spot. A drek-load of new cybereye gear hits the market all the time, some of which is pretty handy. If you see two versions of something, go for the name brand or the more expensive piece; better to pay a little more for quality than go cheap and have it fail at the worst moment. When in doubt, ask around. Somebody somewhere probably uses it and can give you the clean scan.

Cybereyes come with cleaning kits; USE THEM! All the precautions in the fraggin' universe won't keep foreign drek out of the eye socket, and some of the parts are so delicate they can get really fragged up that way.

Wiz but trivial eye gadgets that I like include the retinal clock, the image link, and protective covers. Covers cut down the amount of drek I'll eventually have to deal with, meaning I don't need to clean the eyes as often (especially at inconvenient times!). The image link lets me patch in vidphone images, so I can see who I'm talking to right in my field of vision. As for the clock, I just like to know what time it is. I'm funny that way.

|:----------------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Retinal Clock     | .1           | 450¥   | 3/24 hrs     | 1            |

| Protective Covers | 0            | 500¥   | 4/48 hrs     | 1.5          |
**Retinal Clock** Displays a time/date stamp in the lower right corner of the wearer's field of vision or wherever the user wants. Can be modified for region and season and includes a stopwatch style timer and a countdown timer. Accurate to +/- .0001 seconds per year.

**Image Link** Allows the display of a vidphone image within the field of vision and functions as a **Display Link** (p. 247, SRII).

**Protective Covers** Protects cyber and normal eyes against impact and particles. Available in standard transparent or one-way reflective material; one-way adds 20 percent to the price. At the gamemaster's discretion, covers give 1 point of Impact Armor to the eye area.


### EYE DATAJACKS

These wiz little toys deserve special mention. One type is an eye dataport, the other an optical scanning datajack. The dataport sits behind the iris of the cybereye. You reach up, apply a little pressure to the iris, and it opens to reveal a standard dataport. This toy is handy for sleazing your way into places that someone might try to keep you out of if you happened to be wearing a standard (and visible) datajack. It's tough to tell what's buried in a cybereye without dissecting the whole thing. Drawback is, you end up standing around with your eye plugged into something. Very weird—likely to attract attention if anyone happens along.

The optical scanning datajack includes an emitter unit and a data receptor. The receptor sits In your eye; the emitter you carry around (it's no bigger than a silver oxide battery). You stick the emitter unit onto the data-out port on whatever you came hunting for and you look at it. The data receptor in your eye reads the laser beam put out by the emitter and decodes the data transmitted over it. Dozens of uses for this, neh? It's cutting edge drek, but becoming more available.

### EYE LIGHT SYSTEMS

Eye lights, another nifty new piece of work, can be either a tool or a weapon. The plain-vanilla light system mounts high-powered, low-heat lights in the cybereye that channel a tight, polarized beam outward down a path parallel to the optical center of the eye. An amount of light sufficient to see with standard low-light eyes falls wherever the user is looking. The tight beam and polarization minimize scatter from the eye, so the light can't be seen unless someone's staring right at you.

You can also get a nasty, nasty high-intensity BrightLight flash system. Brights come in two intensities; the first is reusable and works just like a flash-pak. The second is a one-shot deal until the flash units are replaced; this puppy creates a flash bright enough to overload the optic nerves of the poor bastard in front of you, blinding and stunning him at the same time.

### EYE WEAPONS

There are enough deranged minds in the world that somebody had to be working on these things. Eye weapons have specific and limited uses, and I don't recommend them in normal combat situations. For one thing, using them tends to leave you partially blind, at least for awhile. Firing a gun in your eye also inflicts quite a few shocks—like some nasty recoil, for example—but if you're willing to live with that, one of these things might just save your life.

The two types of eye weapons available are a dart and a gun, and they work in similar ways. One ammo load sits in the eye, and is fired through a hole running parallel to the optical axis. When the weapon fires, a sheer covering tears away and reveals the barrel. The eye dart fires Narcoject or toxin rounds; the eye gun fires microbullets. And yes, you can install these weird gadgets in more than one eye.

|          | Essence Cost | Price  | Availability | Street Index |
|:-------- | ------------ | ------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| Eye Dart | .25          | 4,200¥ | 8/2 weeks    | 2            |
| Eye Gun  | .4           | 6,400¥ | 6/1 week     | 3            |
**Eye Dart** Fires half-strength (round up) Narcoject/toxin rounds as a hold-out pistol with one-half range (round down). One shot per reload. Reloading takes 10 Combat Turns. Rounds cost four times the normal price. Firing requires a Special Skill or Quickness Test. Cannot be linked to any kind of aim enhancer. See p. 62, **Street Samurai Catalog**, for Narcoject weapons; p. 186, SRII, for toxins; and pp. 90, 92, 97, **Shadowtech**, for other compounds. After firing, a character must apply a +2 modifier to all visual tests for a period of (4 - Unaugmented Body) Combat Turns, for a minimum of 1 Combat Turn. For rules on the maximum capacity of the orbital socket, see **Cyberware Rules**, p. 45.

**Eye Gun** Treat as a hold-out pistol with a total of four shots. Reloading takes one minute per shot. Ammo costs triple the standard price. Use a Special Skill or Quickness for the **Ranged Combat Test**. Cannot be linked to any kind of aim enhancer. After firing, a character must apply a +2 modifier for all visual tests for a period of (6 - Unaugmented Body) Combat Turns, for a minimum of 2 Combat Turns.

### EYE LASER SYSTEMS

No combat lasers yet, chummers. Gotta wait a few more years for those. Wiz drek you can get includes laser designators, laser trackers, and tool lasers. Word of warning—if someone tries to sell you a headware laser sight and gun-link system, ignore it. Buy a smartgun system or a simple laser sight. Why bother with the cost and hassle of putting cyberdrek in your head when the tech you can carry around works better?

Laser designators do the targeting work for other weapons, just like the full-size units, but at slightly reduced ranges. I know some people who've put tracking weapon mounts on vehicles or drones and slaved them to their eye-laser designator frequencies. Interesting technique, but it implies a scale of combat I'd rather not think about. Me, I'm a hot-flash skirmish man. You won't find me at any tactical engagements.

Laser trackers are laser sights cybernetically tied to a cyberarm that automatically tracks with the sight. The arm tracks exactly where you're looking and aims. Very wiz. Tool lasers can create small welds and cut thin objects, but are too low-powered to cause more than minimal damage. They have their uses, but don't count on hurting somebody much with one.

|                  | Range (in meters) | Essence Cost | Price   | Availability | Street Index |
|:---------------- | ----------------- | ------------ | ------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Laser Designator | 4,000             | .5           | 12,000¥ | 12/1 month   | 3            |
| Laser Tracker    | 400               | .2           | 3,200¥  | 8/72 hrs     | 2            |
| Tool Laser       | 4                 | .25          | 5,200¥  | 8/1 week     | 2            |

**Laser Designator** See pp. 60 and 85, **Fields of Fire**, for more information on laser designators. Maximum range is 1,000 meters.

**Laser Tracker** Ties into a cyberlimb or external weapon mount and auto-tracks a designated target. This function is built into the unit and does not require an additional laser designator.

**Tool Laser** The tool laser has a **Damage Code** of 4L. If it is used as a weapon, make **Combat Tests** using the character's Quickness or a **Special Skill**. These tests have a Base Target Number 4, with a +1 modifier to the target number for each meter or part thereof beyond 1. The Power of the attack is -1 against targets up to two meters away and -2 against targets up to four meters away. Will not penetrate reflective metals or silvered glass, but can cut mirrored plastics.

### CYBEREAR ACCESSORIES

Compared to eyes, cyberears are simple. The market's pretty saturated with cyberear drek already, but I know of a couple of interesting toys. The first is a spatial recognizer, which improves on nature's ability to tell where a sound is coming from. This thing helps you locate the source of what you're hearing—always useful when you're trying to place how far behind you the pounding footsteps are, or the location of the sniper whose foot you just heard scraping against the side of a chimney. It's especially handy in situations where you might be fooled by echoes.

Another nifty cyberear gadget augments the inner ear's natural balance sensors. A friend of mine has one, and I've seen him do some pretty amazing things. He was pretty athletic even before he got the balance augmentor, but now he can jump around and swing from things and hardly ever fall down. He doesn't even wobble for a second, except under rare circumstances. My buddy also tells me the gadget makes it harder for him to deliberately fall down or throw himself off balance. He had to train himself to do that all over again. Weird.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Spatial Recognizer|.2|1,200¥|4/48 hrs|2|
|Balance Augmentor|.4|14,000¥|8/2 weeks|2|

**Spatial Recognizer** This cyberear accessory reduces the target numbers for **Perception Tests** based primarily on sound location by -2 whenever a character attempts to track something by listening for movement. For additional rules in cases of restricted vision, see **Cyberware Rules**, p. 46.

**Balance Augmentor** This device reduces the target numbers by -2 for any **Skill Tests** involving balance, such as climbing, walking across a narrow platform, landing after a jump, and so on. It also applies a -2 modifier in the character's favor to avoid Knockdown (see pp. 91-92 and p. 103, SRII).

### ORAL WEAPONS

Never mind the obvious jokes—some of these actually work and might save your lousy hides someday. Oral darts, guns, spurs and whips may sound weirder than a cross between a hellhound and a toy poodle, but they have their uses. The oral dart and the oral gun work pretty much the same. Each one stores a few rounds of ammo in a cavity in the roof of the mouth, and each has a safety to keep them from firing unless the user's mouth is open. The dart fires mini-Narcoject or toxin rounds, the gun microbullets. As bizarre as these sound, the sheer surprise value may be worth it for some. I've never used either of them, but friends of mine have.

The spur and the whip I find so weird as to be useless, but others may disagree. The oral spur is misnamed, I think. Maybe the slots who make this thing couldn't stomach the thought of marketing an oral ram. The spur's pneumatic trigger uses your own lungs plus some pumps—just prime the system and WHAM. The whip also has a pneumatic, self-priming trigger—and no, you can't get a mono-whip version. Just imagine how much fun that would be to use, neh? Anyone for slicing off his own nose?

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|

|Oral Spur|.25|8,200¥|6/72 hrs|2.5|
|Oral Whip|.25|10,500¥|8/1 week|2.5|

**Oral Dart** Fires Narcoject/toxin rounds at hold-out pistol ranges. Can hold three darts before reloading, which takes 1 minute per dart. Ammo costs double the standard price. Use a **Special Skill** or Quickness for the **Ranged Combat Test**. Cannot be linked to aim enhancers.

**Oral Gun** Treat as a hold-out pistol with a total of four shots. Reloading takes one minute per shot. Ammo costs triple the standard price. Use a **Special Skill** or Quickness for the **Ranged Combat Test**. Cannot be linked to aim enhancers.

**Oral Spur** Treat as a cyberspur: use a **Special Skill** or Quickness for the **Melee Combat Test**.

**Oral Whip** Range equals one meter. Damage is 6M. Use a **Special Skill** or Quickness for the **Ranged Combat Test**.

### TOOTH COMPARTMENT

The hollow tooth makes a great place to hide small items or substances. The first model, activated by biting down hard on it, is the one where the spies in all the old movie used to store cyanide. Much better uses in our wonderful century include activating a micro-homing beacon hidden in the tooth, and so on. I know a couple of people with these, and I've never heard of anyone setting one off accidentally.

The second model is for storage only. Microchips are the contraband of choice, though I've heard people use them to smuggle small medical samples and the like. These puppies are in tight so they can't be accidentally knocked out. They can only be removed manually, and that's no easy task. Most compartment teeth are molars or other biggies at the back of the mouth, to keep them out of harm's way.

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Tooth Compartment|—|—|—|—|
|Breakable|—|700¥|3/48 hrs|1.5|
|Storage|—|1,500¥|2/48 hrs|1.25|

**Tooth Compartment** To break the breakable tooth takes a successful **Willpower (2) Test** if the contents are non-lethal to the user. If the contents are lethal, a **Willpower (4) Test** is required. Tooth contents take effect immediately. The contents of either type of tooth compartment can be removed or replaced in three minutes. To remove a storage tooth takes 2 Complex Actions and a successful **Quickness (4) Test**.

### CRANIAL BOMBS

Here's the clean scoop on the ever-popular menace most of us know as the cortex bomb. Lots of people ask me about these nasty things, and I've monitored enough conversation pits in the Matrix to know how little most folks know about them. A cortex bomb is actually just one kind of cranial bomb, placed at the base of or adjacent to the cerebral cortex where its detonation kills the poor slob carrying it. Cranial bombs can also be placed elsewhere for different results (all just fraggin' lovely).

The cranial bomb known on the streets as a kink bomb is a tiny little fragger, and when it goes off you can barely hear it unless it's in your own head. Placed near the cortex, it kills instantly. Placed adjacent to or within headware memory, detonation destroys said cyberbits and usually leaves the poor slob with a king granddaddy of a headache.

A second kind, the microbomb, is just powerful enough to kill the bearer. If you're standing next to him, you'll hear it go off and maybe get hit with some gray matter. The third kind, officially called an area bomb and affectionately known streetside as the cranial nuke, is a piece of high-grade plastic explosive big enough to have a blast radius. This sick puppy kills the bearer and anybody standing too close to him.

Cranial bombs can be remote or time-detonated. I've even heard of c-bombs hooked up to tiny sound-recognition devices. Say the magic word and—BOOM!

|Microbomb|.2|65,500¥|18/48 hrs|1.25|
|Area Bomb|.4|500,000¥|20/14 days|1|

**Cranial Bombs** If built to do so, all cranial bombs will kill the bearer. At the gamemaster's discretion, kink bombs may have a permanent physiological effect such as blindness, stuttering, and so on. Area bombs can be purchased at Power Levels of 3 through 8 and Damage Levels of M through D. All reduce their blast effects at a rate of -1 per meter. All kill the bearer regardless of blast size.

### DERMAL PLATING AND SHEATHING

This drek's common on the streets and easier to pick out than you might think. Watch for bunching when the person in question moves. Even the highest-quality, lightest grade sheeting isn't flexible enough to move like skin or muscle. (**Orthoskin** does, but that's something else again.)

Plenty of people mistakenly think of dermal plating as armor in the same way that an armored jacket is armor. **Dermal plating** is actually a shock-resistant plastic or semi-metallic fiber weave that distributes some of the energy from impacts—including bullets—over a larger area. Rather than stopping them, it dissipates their kinetic energy as they hit. If you're wearing real armor over your dermals (like any smart sam should), the armor has already slowed the offending object down sufficiently that the plating's small degree of energy dampening actually has an effect.

Users of dermal armor have probably noticed that natural skin doesn't always heal properly where both the skin and the dermal armor have been penetrated. Talk to your street doc about that—he'll know some ways to fix it. One way of dealing with it is to use a new version of dermal plating, known as dermal sheathing, which side-steps some of the problems. **Dermal sheathing** combines the latest advances in dermal plating technology with a semi-synthetic skin sheath. The result is smoother and less bulky than standard dermal plating, with greater self-regenerative capability.

Some dermal sheaths use a technology derived from ruthenium polymers, those nifty chem compounds that can change to such a wide array of colors with a small voltaic charge. This sheathing gives you variable coloration within a specified range. To make it sturdy enough to work well as artificial skin, they combined it with something to stiffen it, so it has nowhere near the flexibility of actual ruthenium polymers. The coloration system works for cyberlimbs too, but that version's a little more expensive. Such is the downside of being a chrome god.

|**Coloration Adaptation**|—|+50%|+2/+4 days|+.25|
|**Cyber Controller**|.1|32,000¥|8/14 days|1.5|

**Dermal Sheath** The dermal sheath boosts the character's **Body Attribute** by a number of points equal to the sheath's level plus 1: for example, Level 2 sheathing adds 3 points. It also provides Impact Armor equal to one-half the level, rounded up. Coloration may be purchased as a camouflage pattern (urban, desert, winter, or wilderness), or a solid color (red, green, blue, or black). The coloration intensity can be varied in 10-percent increments using a hand-control or the cyber-controller. Such devices enable the sheath to function as camouflage clothing (see p. 77, **Fields of Fire**).

### FINGERTIP COMPARTMENTS

Most people think of fingertip compartments as a place to hide things—especially, god help us, monofilament whips. I won't deny the value of the concealment part. But if you insist on using a monofilament whip, please say to yourself "Hatchetman told me so" when you cut off one of your own limbs—as you eventually will.

A fingertip compartment makes a dandy place for a datajack. For those who want (or need) to keep the presence of their datajack a secret, where better to conceal it? (Don't answer that.) The artificial fingertip plugs nicely into the jack when you don't need to use the ware. Lots of advantages to this one—it's convenient and fast, with no messy wires to string up or trip on. Should an unwanted observer happen to stroll by in mid-operation, it's quicker and less conspicuous to yank your finger out of wherever you've stuck it than to detach and coil a cable.

You can also hide a needle in a fingertip compartment. Built-in drug injectors might be handy in certain sticky situations, neh? You can put pretty much anything you want in that injector, but it can only hold one dose.

Some wizzer fingertip compartments even come with built-in lock picks. Don't think nobody uses lock picks anymore. Even in this age of maglocks and other such devices, simple key-and-tumbler locks are still out there. It can ruin your day to find one, unless you're studly enough to tear it off with your teeth (not likely). The lock pick gizmo is mechanical and comes with a micro-expert system. You pop off the fingertip cover, stick your finger up against the keyhole, and the picks do the rest.

|Fingertip ExpertPicks|—|800¥|4/72 hrs|1.5|
|Fingertip Needle|—|1,500¥|4/72 hrs|1.5|

_All of the above require a fingertip compartment; see p. 249, SRII._

---

**Fingertip Needle** Holds one dose of any chemical, poison, toxin, or other appropriate compound. To use the needle, a player character must make a successful **Unarmed Combat Test**. All standard modifiers apply. The needle will not pierce Hardened Armor. Replacing the dose takes two minutes.

**Fingertip ExpertPicks** These lock picks have a **Skill Rating** of 3, and using them is a Complex Action. Most key-and-tumbler locks have a Rating of 2 or 3 depending on their complexity. Resolve attempts to open the lock with an **Opposed Test** between the lock's rating and that of the ExpertPicks.

### CYBERLIMBS

I probably get more questions about cyberlimbs than anything else because there are so many possibilities. I define a cyberlimb as an arm or a leg, or a part of one like a hand, a lower arm, a lower leg, and so on. I'll talk about basic cyberlimbs first, then their possible enhancements. After that, I'll give you chapter and verse about the magnetic cyberlimb system and the cyberarm gyromount (yeah, chumminskis, you read that last one right), a couple of wiz new accessories with which I'm particularly impressed. Next I'll talk weapons, and finally miscellaneous limb accessories. (Once you've read all that, what you don't know about cyberlimbs won't be worth knowing.)

Those of you thinking about getting yourselves a cyberlimb should keep a couple of things in mind. A cyberlimb doesn't work in exactly the same way as a real limb, so it has to be anchored differently. Installing a cyberarm usually involves additional work on the shoulder, while a cyberleg means work on the hip. A partial limb requires a little tinkering with the rest of the arm or leg. Reinforcement is a big part of this work, because cyberlimbs tend to be heavier and stronger than natural limbs. To handle the increased weight and strength, the connecting joints need beefing up.

Also, physical inspections are the tough ones when it comes to keeping your cyberarm a secret. Cyberlimbs look natural to all but the most expert visual inspections, but there's no way to hide that cyberarm or leg from a knowledgeable person who's poking them. Handshakes you can get away with, 'cause lots of people have strong grips. You can also pass through with simple prosthetics most of the time, but the cyberlimbs most shadowfolk like are a little too hard for that.

|Cyberarm/Leg|1|100,000¥|4/4 days|1|
|Cyberhand/Foot|.35|45,000¥|3/4 days|1|
|Cyber Forearm/Lower Leg|.65|70,000¥|4/4 days|1|
|Semi-natural Covering|Same as limb|+10%|4/4 days|1|

**Cyberlimbs** The presence of a cyberlimb adds to the Power of any unarmed combat attack using that limb. See **General Rules for Cyberlimbs**, p. 49 of **Cyberware Rules**. Also, cyberlimbs reduce Essence loss from some types of cyberware. If the cyberware in question exists entirely in the limb and has minimal neurological connections, the limb offsets Essence loss somewhat.

**Semi-natural Covering** This semi-synthetic, natural-looking skin covers the cyberlimb. It adds a +3 modifier to the target number of any visual **Perception Tests** made to notice the cyberlimb. Note that clothing adds an additional +3 modifier at the gamemaster's discretion, based on how much of the limb is showing.

---

### LIMB ENHANCEMENTS

If you're willing to pay, you can get various enhancements for your cyberlimbs to make them stronger, faster and tougher. Enhancements have their limits, however, mostly because of how the various enhancements work together. If you want to make your cyberlimbs stronger, faster and tougher all at the same time, you'll end up with one mean piece of chrome for which you'll have paid one nasty hunk of nuyen.

Why the expense? Think about it. I want my limbs stronger, so I pay for heavier lifting servos and more powerful pneumatic and flat-motor systems. That adds weight and bulk. Now that I've got more bulk to move around, making the heavier limb move faster means a major upgrade to the motion servos—which also costs me. To make the limb tougher, I add dermal plating or reinforce it some other way, once again adding weight and bulk and cost, and—you get the idea.

Simple strength, speed, or toughness enhancements are easy enough to handle, up to a point—you pay your nuyen and you take your choice. Once you've beefed up your cyberlimb to the point where its capabilities roughly double the human norm, the cost escalates, especially if you want anything that looks even remotely human. If you can live with decidedly cyber-looking cyberlimbs, however, you have no problem.

### MAGNETIC CYBERLIMB SYSTEM

This system for cyberarms and legs is a series of electro-magnets mounted in the hands, knees and feet. They let you hold on to things better—metal things, that is, specifically things made of ferrous metals. (The drek that cyberware and such is made of is right out, chummeroo. Sorry.) With that limitation, some people might pass this gadget up—after all, most metals these days are non-ferrous. In fact, most "metals" are actually a semi-metallic polymer compound. However, the mag system still has its uses. There's enough out there that you can grab onto to make it worth having. Lots of vehicles, especially trucks and big cars, have enough ferrous metal. So do buildings (beams, supports and so on), railings, support cables, and such. A friend of mine with this system has put metal plates in the grips of his guns and other weapons. He doesn't drop them anymore.

Sorry to tell you, though, that the magnetic field generated by the system won't really affect modern electronics. We use mostly light-optics these days—you might be able to mess with the power supply, but the effect won't amount to much. These magnets can't even erase optical chips.

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Magnetic Cyberlimb System (per cyberlimb)|.2|2,800¥|6/7 days|2|

**Magnetic Cyberlimb System** Each limb system can only hold about 25 kilograms. Multiple systems are cumulative. The weight the magnets can hold is subtracted from the weight of anything being held (see **Dangling and Holding**, p. 51 of **Cyberware Rules**).

### CYBERARM GYROMOUNT

Here's the one the sammie boys are twitchin' in the street for—a gyromount IN YOUR ARM. Pretty wiz, neh? Some bunch of bright techboys brought this puppy to market about six weeks ago, so we are talking white-drek-hot. Talk about improving your firing capability—better balance, nowhere near as much recoil from big nasty guns—a fraggin' beautiful piece of 'ware. Want to know the best part? It works just like a regular cyberarm! You can enhance it and play with it and do pretty much whatever you like to it. Okay, now for the drawbacks. First, don't even think about hiding the fact that this is a cyberarm. The pair of counterweights that come out near the wrist when you start to rock-and-roll are a dead giveaway, believe me. Also, it costs a lot of nuyen. This thing costs BIG 'cause it's new and you all want it. You REALLY want it, you've got to pay for it. Go find a gold mine, folks.

Here's one more thing you'll find useful with a cyberarm gyromount, or any other wiz piece of hardware you choose to stick in your limbs—the direct neural interface. This ever-so-handy device passes data directly from a piece of gear in a cyberarm to your brain, giving you cybernetic control of your gyromount/gun/whatever.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cyberarm Gyromount|1.5|260,000¥|10/21 days|4|
|Direct Neural Interface|.1|4,500¥|4/6 days|2|

**Gyromount Cyberarm** This piece of cyberware works like a standard gyromount and provides 3 points of recoil reduction. It can be used with any weapon up to and including a light machine gun.

**Direct Neural Interface** Allows cybernetic control of any device not originally designed to be cybernetically controlled that is placed in a cyberlimb, at a 50 percent increase in the device's cost.

### OTHER CYBERLIMB ACCESSORIES

You have the foot spur, replacement hand, and cyberarm cyberdeck to consider. The foot spur shoots down through the heel of the cyberfoot. You can stab somebody with it or anchor yourself to the ground. How well it works depends on what kind of ground you're shooting it into. You can get a foot spur for your regular foot, but lots of work has to be done to your ankles and shins so your bones don't just snap off near the blade when pressure is applied.

You see replacement hands in all the stupid trid shows, and I think they belong there. Still, some people must think it's wiz to have a hand with a Walther PPK already in it. Me, I'd rather take the half-second to pick up whatever I need.

The cyberarm cyberdeck is a deck you can install in your cyberarm. Deckers probably love this one. I'm not a decker, so I don't care about it. You can also get tactical computers and orientation systems installed in a cyberarm; both are incredibly useful.

**_See Cyberarm Cyberdeck, p. 36._**

---

**Foot Anchor** As a weapon, the foot spur does (**STR**-1)M Damage. As an anchor, it cannot penetrate materials with a **Barrier Rating** higher than 8, the **Barrier Rating** of most pavement. Each foot anchored increases the amount of weight a character can hold up or hang on to by a maximum of 50 kilograms. If the foot anchor is set into a material with a **Barrier Rating** of less than 8, each **Barrier Rating** point below 8 reduces the amount of weight by 5 kilograms. See **Dangling and Holding**, p. 51 of **Cyberware Rules**.

**Replacement Hand** Attaching/removing a replacement hand requires a free hand and a Complex Action. A variety of tool and gear/weapon hands are available, at a 30-percent increase of the cost of the item itself. Weapons built into a replacement hand receive a +1 modifier to the target number for purposes of **Combat Tests**.

---

### OTHER CYBERLIMB ACCESSORIES (CONTINUED)

**Cyberarm Cyberdeck** Players may install standard or cranial cyberdecks in cyberarms. For standard decks, multiply the price of the selected deck by 4, increase the **Availability** target number by 25 percent (round up), and double the **Base Time** for acquiring it. See p. 38, **Shadowtech**, for rules on installing a cranial cyberdeck in the arm. Increase the standard target number for building each component by +2, and increase costs and **Base Times** per component by 20 percent.

**Tactical Computer/Orientation System** Cyberarm versions of these pieces of equipment work in the same way as cranial versions (pp. 53 and 63 of **Shadowtech**, respectively).

### CYBERLIMB WEAPONS

Most of you folks reading this already know about the weapons usually mounted in a cyberlimb: spurs, razors, and cyberguns. I know of a few more (surprise, surprise!): the hand blade, the shock hand, the cyberarm taser, and the cyberSquirt.

The hand blade slips out of the side of the hand opposite the thumb, parallel to the hand. This dandy little weapon can make a punch pretty fragging nasty. The side of the blade closest to your own hand has no sharp edge, so you can't cut yourself by accident. You can also get the hand blade implanted in a normal hand, but the hand-side edge tends to bruise flesh if you strike out sideways and hit something too hard. That's no problem for hand blades in a cyberarm, of course.

The shock hand consists of shock pads built into the knuckles or palm of the hand that impart a nasty charge to the poor sap you hit. They're a little more expensive than traditional shock gloves or batons, but the convenience is worth the minor expense. The cyberarm taser works exactly like a taser pistol, but with a limited number of shots. Might come in handy in certain situations.

The cyberSquirt is an Ares Squirt mounted as a cyberweapon. It's a nice, handy weapon to have, especially for getting through armor clothing or Kevlar, but I've heard at least one report of containment leakage. Be careful with this one—dosing yourself accidentally can really ruin your day.

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Hand Blade|.1|7,500¥|6/5 days|1.5|
|Retractable|.25|10,000¥|6/5 days|1.5|

|Cyberarm Taser|—|2,000¥|6/4 days|1.5|
|CyberSquirt|—|1,400¥|8/6 days|2|

**Hand Blades** Hand blades do (**STR** + 3)L Damage. Essence Cost only applies if the blade is mounted in a normal hand.

**Shock Hand and Cyberarm Taser** The shock hand does 8S Damage and holds 12 charges. It must be recharged after 12 uses. The cyberarm taser does 10S Damage, but can fire only two shots before recharging. It has the same ranges as the standard taser (p. 103, SRII).

**CyberSquirt** The cyberSquirt fires up to 10 shots at a time of chemical/biological agents in a special gelling agent. Like the non-cybered Ares Squirt, the cyberSquirt holds 10 chemical rounds and the gel reservoir holds enough gel for up to 20 shots. The reservoir must be reloaded once for every 2 cartridge reloads. The gel is made of DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide), a utility chemical that forces the skin to absorb delivered chemical/biological agents. Porous armor, such as armor clothing and Kevlar weaves, offers no protection against DMSO. Rigid armor (higher than 5, or plated) applies half its normal Defensive Rating (rounded up) against DMSO attacks. (See p. 92, **Shadowtech**, for effects of DMSO.)

### CYBERTORSOS AND SKULLS

Here's a scary thought—a cyber-body and a cyber-head to go with your cyberarms and legs. Hardly enough warm human flesh left to bother with, is there? The perfect mechanism, driven by a human brain and soul. Better than God made, 'cause we can fix the Cyber Man a lot easier.

The doctors and scientists here talk about this a lot. They think I'm not listening, that the music coming over my headset drowns out their words, But I can hear them. It scares me. But listening to the nurses scares me even more. The doctors are clinical, scientific. The nurses call it like they see it. You know what they call Cyber Man? A zombie.

You don't need to know about that. You need to know about the cybertorso and the cyberskull. They act as framework and protection for various other cybersystems, kind of like how our real torsos and skulls protect our vulnerable insides.

Body plating can give you more protection if you want it. Ceramic and hybrid-polymer plating replaces the outer casing of your various cyber body parts, as soft armor or hardened armor depending on how much you've got to spend.

---

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Cybertorso|1.5|120,000¥|6/4 days|1|
|Cyberskull|.75|75,000¥|6/4 days|1|
|**Body Plating**|—|—|—|—|
|Soft Armor|—|10,000¥/level|12/2 weeks|2|
|Hard Armor|—|25,000¥/level|14/3 weeks|2|

**Cybertorso and Cyberskull** The cybertorso and cyberskull each add +1 to the character's **Body Attribute**. The cybertorso also reduces by half (round up) the additional Essence cost of Strength or Quickness enhancements beyond 3 points (see **Limb Enhancements**, p. 31, and **Cyberware Rules**, p. 49).

**Body Plating** Soft armor adds 1 point of Ballistic and Impact armor per level, cumulative with any armor worn. Hard armor also adds 1 point of Ballistic and Impact armor per level, but functions as hardened armor per the critter power **Hardened Armor** (p. 218, SRII). Body plating can also be applied to cyberlimbs. See also **Armor**, p. 49 of **Cyberware Rules**.

### WIRED REFLEX SYSTEMS

Some people say—and I'm one of them—that a street samurai lives and dies by his reflexes. Edge is everything. That extra millisecond off the starting block could mean life or death—yours or someone else's. When folks think of reflex enhancers, they tend to think purely in terms of wired reflexes, boosted reflexes, synaptic accelerators, and so on. Good ware, all of it—but I know a couple other options.

A reaction enhancer, for example, increases your reaction time by replacing part of your spinal column with superconducting material. I don't know what material they use, but I have friends who tell me that it works. And as long as it works, who cares about much else?

A reflex trigger is a variant of wired reflexes. Get this cybernetic device installed along with your wired reflexes, and you can turn those reflexes on and off. (You can't get it installed after the fact—the wiring won't work right.) I know a bunch of people who'd have gone for the trigger like a shot if they'd had the chance. Do you have any idea what it's like to go through normal life wired to the max? Reflexes are an automatic, instinctive response. People have lots of reflexive actions—fight or flight, for example—but if they have to, the unwired can usually shut down the reflex before acting on it. With wired reflexes, you can't always manage that. Sometimes that can result in unfortunate accidents—I speak from experience. The trigger can help you avoid that kind of thing. If you're contemplating wires, get a trigger. It's a good investment.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|Reaction Enhancer|.3/point|60,000¥|6/7 days|2|
|Reflex Trigger|+.2|+13,000¥|Same as wired reflexes|As wired reflexes|

**Reaction Enhancers** Player characters may increase Reaction up to a maximum of +6 in this manner. The reaction enhancer is completely compatible with all other reaction/Initiative boosters except the move-by-wire system (see p. 39) and the adrenal pump (p. 19, **Shadowtech**).

**Reflex Trigger** Activating or deactivating wired reflexes with a reflex trigger requires a Simple Action. For additional information, see **Effects of Wired Reflexes**, p. 53 of **Cyberware Rules**.

### MOVE-BY-WIRE SYSTEM

This wiz piece of wire needs a little background explanation. Modern aircraft and some other kinds of vehicles (t-birds mostly) use what's known as a fly-by-wire system. As I've heard it explained, the design of the aircraft is inherently unstable. It literally wants to fly in all directions at once. The fly-by-wire system keeps it under control by using a series of redundant computers that continually counteract the chaotic motion of the craft. This also means that when the craft is told to move in a specific direction, it already wants to do that, and so is much more responsive and maneuverable. Imagine applying this to a person, and you've got the move-by-wire system.

As I understand it, this system puts your body in a constant state of seizure. A computer in your brain monitors the state of the seizure and counteracts its effects until you tell it that you want to move. At that point it channels the effects of the seizure along the motion path desired.

This system lets you move with unnatural smoothness. Move-by-wire makes someone with mere balance augmentation look spastic. You can spot the joker with move-by-wire a mile off. There's another giveaway too, which I suspect will disappear once they perfect the technology. Every once in a while the person with a move-by-wire system develops a slight tremor in one muscle group. It's not as obvious as a twitch or spasm, but you can see it if you're looking for it or at it. As far as I know, the tremor only hits when the muscle group is at rest. If it's in motion, everything's fine. I figure it has something to do with built-in errors when the system's compensating for the seizure, but don't quote me on that.

### WEAPON MOUNTS

Here's some red meat for the round-the-bend hard boys out there: external mounts, tracking mounts, and articulate arms. Some of these mounts can only go on a cyberlimb or cybertorso, thank fraggin' whoever, so don't even think about bolting one on your real shoulder. You could probably get some psycho street doc to do it for you, but you probably wouldn't be all that happy with the result.

The external mount for the cyberarm is a simple mounting point, sort of like a hardpoint, that allows a cybernetic connection to a weapon already mounted there. The guns that attach to the external mount are equivalents of cyberguns and are fully smartgun-capable. I like this piece of ware; it lets you mount and use a gun while keeping your hands free. That's what I call an advantage.

The tracking mount is usually connected to an eye laser tracking system and extends at an angle off the shoulder to get clear of the head. Obviously, this mount requires a cybertorso. This puppy also has a dead spot for fire where the user's head is, so figure about 10 degrees to either side of the head is blocked.

The articulate arm is a separate articulate tracking mount, usually anchored to a cybertorso in the middle of the back. This baby has a full range of motion and can cover fragging near any firing angle. We're talking big and nasty and don't-mess-with-me. It's a little too much that way for my taste, but the hard-edged razorboys ought to lap it up.

|---|---|---|---|---|
|External Mount|.1|3,200¥|6/4 days|2|
|Tracking Mount|.25|24,000¥|8/7 days|2|
|Articulate Arm|.25|110,000¥|12/24 days|2|

**External Mount** Attaching or detaching a weapon from this mount requires a Complex Action. The mount takes light, heavy, or machine pistols and submachine guns; double the cost of the weapon. Player characters can buy external ammo pods that hold 50 rounds, but only one pod can be mounted at any given time. For quadruple the listed price, the mount can be made to retract into a cyberarm that has had a Body enhancement of at least +1.

**Tracking Mount** This mount is a motorized, pivoting tracking system that ties into an eye laser designator. It can take light, heavy, or machine pistols, submachine guns, and assault rifles; triple the cost of the weapon. Player characters can buy external ammo pods that hold 50 rounds, but only one pod can be mounted at any given time. The system gives users 3 points of Recoil Reduction, plus the same modifiers as a laser sight.

**Articulate Arm** This mount works like a tracking mount, but has a full range of motion and covers a 360-degree firing area. The articulate arm can take all light weapons up to a light machine gun. The system gives users 3 points of Recoil Reduction, plus the same modifiers as a laser sight.

### MISCELLANEOUS CYBERWARE

Here's a couple of odd pieces: the induction datajack and the internal air tank. Anybody jumping around and getting all loopy over the induction datajack, calm down. It's a wizzer little toy, but it does not allow you to grab a wire or put your hand on a computer and suck up data from it. This jack is a subdermal induction pad. You can attach a cable and a special induction connector between it and the standard data-out port on a cyberdeck or computer and then use it just like a standard datajack. Because it's under the skin, it can't be seen, so you can jander into places that might be harder to crack if the security guard saw a bright silver datajack at your temple.

The internal air tank is exactly what it sounds like—an independent air source. While breathing from it, you are immune to any inhalable toxin or sleepy gas or other compound. The tank only holds about twenty minutes' worth of air, so don't stay anywhere dangerous for too long. Refilling it takes five minutes.

||Essence Cost|Price|Availability|Street Index|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Induction Datajack|.3|3,000¥|5/4 days|2|
|Internal Air Tank|.25|1,200¥|4/5 days|1.5|

**Induction Datajack** Performs identically to standard and improved datajacks (p. 246 of SRII and p. 45 of **Shadowtech**, respectively). For the induction equivalent to the datajacks listed in **Shadowtech**, add .1 to the Essence, multiply the Price by 3, and use the Availability/Street Index listed above.

**Air Tank** The internal air tank can be vented if necessary.

### Cyberware Rules

**Cyberware Rules** provides revised and expanded rules for various pieces of cybertechnology in the **Shadowrun** game. Some of these have been described in previous sourcebooks—others are new. The rules in this section deal with some of the pros and cons of cyberware in greater detail than in previously published sourcebooks, so that gamemasters can enrich their gaming sessions by bringing additional elements into play. This section does not attempt to give detailed rules for every possible situation in which cyberware may be used, but rather offers broad guidelines.

In all instances where material in this section contradicts previously published material, the newer material should take precedence, but the gamemaster ultimately decides which version to use. As always, the name of the game is fun and the gamemaster is the final arbiter. Gamemasters should keep in mind, however, that an over-chromed campaign can become unbalanced and dull very quickly. If the gamemaster wants to limit his players' ability to obtain or use certain pieces of cybertech, he can make those items unavailable, horrendously expensive, or otherwise undesirable. For example, the clinic that outfits the runners with the forbidden ware may sell them inferior gear and then go out of business. Alternatively, he may simply let the players have whatever they want and make them deal with subsequent cyberware damage. (There are a hundred ways to skin a chromed rat.)

---

### CYBERWARE QUALITY

As veteran **Shadowrun** players and gamemasters already know, cyberware comes in various forms: standard, second-hand, alpha-grade, beta-grade, and even delta-grade. Alpha, beta, and delta grades represent various levels of quality and sophistication beyond standard, off-the-shelf cyberware. If alpha-grade cyberware is comparable to a simple home stereo system, delta-grade would represent a custom audiophile rack system. Both play music, but delta-grade is far more capable and reliable than alpha-grade. Second-hand cyberware comes in standard, alpha, and beta grades, but is less reliable than new cyberware of the same grade.

Only standard and alpha-grade cyberware are mass-produced. Beta-grade pieces are usually custom-made. Delta-grade cyberware is always custom-made for the individual, which makes it Essence-friendly but also prohibitively expensive. Medical costs and repair times for delta-grade cyberware are quadruple those for standard equipment. Essence reductions, cost multipliers, and damage resistance statistics for alpha, beta, and delta-grade cyberware appear below.

Player characters can get alpha- and beta-grade custom cyberware at most shadow clinics, but delta-grade cyberware is far more difficult to acquire. Stumbling across a delta-grade cyberware clinic is nearly impossible for Joe Shadowrunner. Some corps run such clinics, but a player character cannot just make an appointment to go in for a lube job. The corp has to want the character to be at the clinic (and if the corp wants someone, there's got to be a reason).

Some types of cyberware, especially anything involving cybermancy, require a delta-grade clinic for installation. For more information, see **Cybermancy**, pp. beginning on p. 64.

---

| | Essence Reduction | Cost Multiplier | Damage Resistance |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alpha-grade** | -20% (x .8) | × 3 | 5/6 |
| **Beta-grade** | -40% (x .6) | × 7 | 4/5 |
| **Delta-grade** | -50% (x .5) | × 10 | 3/4 |

---

### ESSENCE REDUCTION

Reduce the amount of Base Essence Cost by the percentage listed (or use the multiplier given in parentheses). Round all numbers up. Essence Cost may never be reduced below .05 in this manner.

### COST MULTIPLIER AND MEDICAL FEES

Multiply the cost for the cyberware by the number indicated. This represents only the cost for the piece of cyberware and does not include doctor's fees and hospitalization. For alpha- and beta-grade cybersurgery, doctor's fees and hospitalization are 50 times the rates listed on p. 145 of the **Shadowrun** basic rules. For delta-grade cybersurgery, the fees are 200 times the rates listed.

### DAMAGE RESISTANCE

The first number given is the target for resisting damage from **Serious Wounds**, the second from **Deadly Wounds**. When a piece of custom cyberware is damaged, roll 5 dice against the target number indicated above. If a single success is achieved, the cyberware takes no damage.

---

### GENERAL RULES ON DAMAGE

Rules for damage to cyberware previously published in **The Street Samurai Catalog** and **Shadowtech** deal with gross effects of damage and the procedures necessary for repairs. However, damage to cyberware can also cause extremely inconvenient secondary effects. For example, damaged cybereyes may begin to short out, suffer color shifts, and so on. Rules for the various kinds of cyberware addressed in this section include specific secondary effects of damage that gamemasters can use to bring a little spice and stress into the player characters' lives.

As an alternative to the rules in previous sourcebooks for determining whether and where cyberware damage occurs, gamemasters can use the following quick-and-dirty system. Whenever a character takes a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound**, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 after all **Damage Resistance Tests** are resolved. If the result is less than the number of boxes of damage taken (6 for Serious and 10 for Deadly), the character's cyberware takes damage. Because the possible combinations of cyberware that a player character may cram into his body are virtually infinite, the gamemaster decides what specific piece of cyberware has been damaged. The damage should have a logical connection with the location of the wound, and the gamemaster's choice should not unduly hinder the player character. The goal is to add more challenge to the game, but not make it impossible for player characters to succeed.

---

### HEADWARE

The following rules apply to various types of headware, from communications gear to cybereyes and cyberears and their accessories.

#### COMMUNICATIONS

Information and basic rules for the headware radio and telephone appear on pp. 246-247, SRII. Those for the communications link, crypto-circuit **HD**, and scramble breaker **HD** appear in the **Street Samurai Catalog**, pp. 76, 77, and 81. Rules and information for the tactical communications system appear in **Fields of Fire**, pp. 59 and 86.

The cybercomm link is essentially a transducer that converts thoughts into speech, making it possible to communicate without talking aloud. Because the transducer has no transmitting or receiving capacity, using it as part of a communications system requires a radio transmitter. In addition to being useful for the clandestine communications of shadowrunners, the cybercomm link has revolutionized the lives of people who suffer from congenital muteness or have suffered severe damage to their vocal chords.

**Jamming, Counter-Jamming and Encryption**
Jamming and counter-jamming are achieved with **ECM/ECCM** add-ons to communication equipment (see **Using Equipment**, p. 184, SRII). To resolve jamming or counter-jamming attempts, make an opposed test pitting the rating of the jamming component against the rating of the counter-jamming component (or vice-versa). Characters who have a **Special Skill** related to the use of the jamming or counter-jamming element in question, or who have encephalon (see p. 49, **Shadowtech**), may add a number of additional dice up to the rating of the **ECM/ECCM** gear. The jammer or counter-jammer that achieves the greater number of net successes accomplishes its task; in the case of a tie, the jamming unit is successful. The number of net successes determines the overall success of the jamming or counter-jamming attempt. Multiply the number of successes by 10. The result is the percent of the message that is received or is blocked.

To resolve attempts at encryption and decryption of communications signals, use the same procedure as for jamming and counter-jamming.

**Secondary Damage**
If a headware communications unit takes damage, roll 2D6 and consult the **Communications Headware Secondary Damage** table to determine secondary effects.

All secondary effects continue until the damaged unit is repaired. If the gamemaster is using the quick-and-dirty damage system, the target number of any appropriate **Repair Test** is equal to one-half (round down) the secondary-effect dice roll result.

---

### COMMUNICATIONS HEADWARE SECONDARY DAMAGE

| Dice Roll Result | Secondary Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2-4 | No effect, lucky you. |
| 5-7 | Static; garbles message. |
| 8-9 | Intermittent signal; approximately half of message gets through. |
| 10-11 | Unit functions intermittently and must be struck or jostled to work again after failure. For attempts to get it working, make a **Quickness (3) Test**. |
| 12 | Total unit failure; nothing but continual annoying static. |

### CYBEREYES AND ACCESSORIES

In general, any combination of accessories can be installed in a cybereye, subject to the following Essence limits. Per pair, cybereyes cost a player character .2 points of Essence on installation. The eyes can handle an additional .5 Essence points' worth of accessories, such as low-light amplification, without additional cost to the character. In other words, a total of .7 Essence points actually costs the character .2 Essence points. Cybereye accessories can be added or removed without impacting the Essence of the character. When dealing with beta- and delta-grade cybereyes, make the necessary adjustments for Essence loss before considering the .5 allowance for accessories.

Though cybereyes are usually purchased in pairs, they can be purchased singly. A single cybereye costs 60 percent of the standard purchase price, takes up .1 Essence and accepts accessories worth only .25 points of Essence before adding to the total Essence cost. Cybereye accessories that require a pair to work well, such as low-light amplification, thermographics, and cyberoptic camera or **Smartcam** systems (see pp. 89-90, **Shadowbeat**) are less effective in a single eye. The gamemaster may find it necessary to determine the exact loss of efficiency, but in general such systems operate about half as well in one eye as in two. Many other systems, such as a laser designator or a display link, are single-eye enhancements to begin with and so are not affected. Vision magnification systems can provide proper magnification with only one eye; however, they cannot provide any depth perception to characters with only one cybereye. A +4 modifier applies to the target number of any **Combat Tests** made while the vision magnification is active; this modifier is cumulative with other modifiers (if any). Needless to say, eye weapons and laser systems can only be mounted in a cybereye.

The small size of the (meta)human eye socket represents a built-in limitation to the number of accessories that can be installed in a cybereye. Player characters cannot walk around with guns, darts, lasers, cameras, and all kinds of other things packed into such a confined space. To reflect this, gamemasters should seriously consider the following limits. Accessories worth a maximum of 1.2 Essence points can be installed in a pair of cybereyes (including the free .5 Essence points conferred by the standard rules), and only one accessory per eye may be a weapon system. Player characters hoping to get around that limitation by installing a tool laser that can function as an extra weapon are out of luck: a single cybereye cannot mount a tool laser and a gun or dart. In addition, a cybereye with a cybercam installed in it cannot accommodate a weapon system or a tool laser because there is not sufficient room. (Of course, there's nothing to stop the really determined from installing a different weapon in each eye.)

**Secondary Damage**
If a cybereye takes damage, roll 2D6 and consult the **Cybereye Secondary Damage** table to determine secondary effects. A character who uses an eye gun automatically damages his cybereyes because of the shock of recoil in such a confined space. Even with the stabilization systems available, recoil in the orbital cavity remains an almost insoluble problem. Eye guns should be treated as one-shot items for desperate situations.

All secondary effects continue until the unit is repaired. If the gamemaster is using the quick-and-dirty damage system, the target number of any appropriate **Repair Tests** is equal to one-half (round down) the secondary-effect dice roll result.

### CYBEREYE SECONDARY DAMAGE

| Dice Roll Result | Secondary Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2-4 | No effect, lucky you. |
| 5-6 | Black-and-white image. |
| 7 | Blurred vision: add +2 to all target numbers for tests involving perception at a distance. |
| 8-9 | Image intermittent; eye must be struck or jostled to work again after failure. To get it working, make a **Quickness (3) Test**. |
| 10-11 | One eye fails; add a +4 modifier to the target number for any tests involving depth perception. |
| 12 | Total unit failure: signal provides nothing but continual annoying static. |

**Eye Dataports and Optical Scanning Datajacks**
The standard data flow rate (**DFR**) of an eye dataport is 25 (the **DFR** of the standard datajack in SRII). To find costs for ports with higher **DFRs**, add .05 to the Essence Cost and double the purchase price listed below for each 25-point increase to the **DFR** (to a maximum of 100).

| Level | DFR | Essence Cost | Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 25 | .10 | 500¥ |
| 2 | 50 | .15 | 1,000¥ |
| 3 | 75 | .20 | 2,000¥ |
| 4 | 100 | .25 | 4,000¥ |

For an optical scanning datajack, the standard **DFR** is 20. To find costs for optical datajacks with higher **DFRs**, use the rules given above for eye dataports. Note that the cost increase applies to the emitter as well.

The description of the optical scanning datajack (**Comfortably Numb**, p. 20) refers to "pressing on the iris" to render the datajack functional. Literally pressing on the iris would temporarily blind that eye. To keep this from occurring, optical scanning datajacks are either mounted in a secondary iris-like structure not apparent to casual inspection, or they feature a mirror to refract light to the cyber-retina.

**BrightLight Systems**
The reusable **BrightLight** flash system operates like the standard flash-pak (**Street Samurai Catalog**, p. 45). Opponents facing the light system receive a +4 modifier to their target numbers for all ranged attacks; flare compensation reduces this modifier to +2. In addition, the target number modifier is reduced by 1 for every 5 meters that the opponent is standing from the character using the eye light system. The system also negates the effects of poor or absent lighting for the duration of its use, but the strobe effect imposes a +2 modifier to all the user's target numbers.

The flash-pak unit can flash three times before the battery must be replaced. A replacement battery costs 150¥ and takes 10 minutes to install.

The battery and bulb for the high-powered one-shot flash-pak must be replaced after every use. Replacement batteries and bulbs are commonly available at a cost of 10¥ each. The batteries can also be bought in packs of six for 50¥. The flash only affects targets directly in front of the user. If a question arises as to whether or not the target is looking directly at the user, the gamemaster may (at his discretion) resolve the dispute with an opposed test pitting the Reaction of the user against the Reaction of the target. The target's net successes apply to his **Damage Resistance Test**. The user's net successes do not apply, as the game mechanic already assumes that the target is looking the user full in the face.

The nature of this weapon precludes the need for a **Combat Test**. Instead, each target must make a **Damage Resistance Test** against a target number equal to 12 minus the number of meters away from the user they are standing. The **BrightLight** system does Serious Stun damage, and the target must also apply a modifier to the target numbers for all visual tests equal to the number of boxes of damage done. This effect fades at the rate of 1 point per minute. If the target suffers a **Deadly Wound**, certain effects may become permanent at the gamemaster's discretion.

The **BrightLight** flash is visible for three kilometers, unless line of sight is somehow blocked. Used inside a building or room, the light will seep through any crack or opening and might even be visible throughout an entire floor. Users also risk blinding friends as well as foes. To determine whether or not this happens, the gamemaster should apply a version of the **Blast in a Confined Space** rules (p. 97, SRII), assuming a starting Power Level of 12 that degrades by 1 for every meter that the light travels. Under this rule, even someone standing behind the user might be blinded by the flash. Also, whenever a character uses the **BrightLight** flash, the gamemaster rolls 2D6. On a result of 2 or 3, the user is blinded and must replace his cybereyes.

**Eye Laser Systems**
Eye lasers and light systems run on battery power, which means that player characters who have them must carry the batteries (and a couple of spares, if they're smart) somewhere. Batteries supplying power to such systems can be stored anywhere on the character's person. A character can even carry laser batteries externally, connecting them to the laser system via an interface so that he can change power packs when needed without having to open up interesting body cavities that a runner might not want exposed in dangerous situations. The gamemaster determines how runners equipped with these systems can manage to plug in and recharge. However, it is unlikely that the need for such details will arise often in game play. Eye lasers have extremely specific uses, and should not become major elements of any character's personal arsenal.

### CYBEREAR ACCESSORIES

At the gamemaster's discretion, special rules may apply when using the spatial recognizer in certain situations—for example, when attempting to locate something or someone moving around a corner or in a maze of corridors. In such cases, the gamemaster may apply a -1 modifier to the target numbers of all **Perception Tests** made to locate an object or person. This modifier only applies in visually dull environments—featureless corporate corridors, boringly decorated interiors painted in drab colors, and so on. The spatial recognizer is most effective when visual input is absent or restricted, because visual input tends to be dominant when the brain processes information. Therefore, an overabundance of things to look at swamps the spatial recognizer and renders it virtually useless.

**Secondary Damage**
If a cyberear takes damage, roll 2D6 and consult the **Cyberear Secondary Damage** table to determine the secondary effects.

All secondary effects continue until the unit is repaired. If the gamemaster is using the quick-and-dirty damage system, the target number of all appropriate **Repair Tests** is equal to one-half (round down) the secondary effect dice roll result.

---

### CYBEREAR SECONDARY DAMAGE

| Dice Roll Result | Secondary Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2-4 | No effect, lucky you. |
| 5-6 | Lower end of the sound spectrum cuts out. |
| 7 | Static; add a +2 modifier to all target numbers for tests to discern sounds. |
| 8-9 | Sound intermittent; ear must be struck or jostled to work again after failure. To get it working, make a **Quickness (3) Test**. |
| 10-11 | One ear fails. Apply a +4 modifier to the target number for all tests involving spatial sound perception. |
| 12 | Total unit failure; user hears nothing except continual, annoying static. |

---

### ORAL WEAPONS

Oral darts and guns are usually concealed in a compartment in the roof of the mouth. When triggered, they drop into shooting position and fire when the character opens his mouth. The gamemaster may impose penalties on characters equipped with oral darts or guns when such characters make **Perception Tests** using their innate sense of smell, because such cyberware may interfere with sinus functioning.

The oral spur and whip are becoming popular among certain hardcore street samurai because they are significantly less common and harder to spot than such weapons as hand razors. Some rough-edged bullyboys believe that the unexpectedness of these oral weapons gives them an edge in combat. Also, a character can use these weapons even when his hands and legs are tied. In general, however, the limitations on oral weapons (small number of shots and/or short ranges) make them useful only in highly specialized situations.

The oral whip can only be used effectively if the character can impart momentum from head movement. Though the whip is powered, it tends to pop out like an extra-strong party streamer if the user's head is restrained or still. The gamemaster may decide to reduce the whip's Damage Code if a character uses this weapon while his head is restrained. A control mechanism monitors the user's head position at all times to ensure that the whip always retracts smoothly and does not strike the user inadvertently.

---

### CRANIAL BOMBS

The common name, "cortex bomb," is actually something of a misnomer. The microbomb has a devastating effect if placed near any major internal organ—close to the heart, for example, or next to a major spinal nerve group. The area bomb kills no matter where it is located in a person's body. The term "cortex bomb" is historical in origin: initially these deadly devices were located in the central nervous system to make their surgical removal extremely difficult. In those long-departed days of the 2020's, brain surgery was a more chancy business than it is in 2055. Corporations who placed these bombs in their couriers liked being able to activate the bombs and dispose of compromised couriers before the opposition could get at the information they wanted. Cortex bombs also made useful devices for blackmail and coercion.

Although they are most often placed in the brain, kink bombs can be implanted near any expensive piece of cyberware. They are often implanted in cyberlimbs. Cyberlimbs are expensive, and few people will risk losing them by disobeying orders.

The gamemaster may adjust the cost of area bombs with different Damage Codes, but should consider a minimum of 300,000¥ for the weakest versions.

---

### BODYWARE

The following rules apply to various types of bodyware, from dermal plating and sheaths to cyberlimbs.

#### DERMAL PLATING

Repairing damage done to dermal plating by a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound** requires a spray bonder that re-bonds the damaged dermal fiber weave by augmenting the fiber's innate self-repairing properties. A repair kit with this spray bonder costs 500¥ for 10 applications. Failure to use the spray bonder may result in long-term damage to the weave. If a player character with dermal plating takes damage to it from a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound** and does not use the spray bonder on the damaged plating within 24 hours, the gamemaster should note that fact. From then on, whenever that character suffers a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound** (after resolution of the **Damage Resistance Test**) from non-explosive weapons or magic, the gamemaster rolls 2D6. If the result is less than the number of times the character has failed to use the spray bonder on a damaged area, the effective rating of the dermal plating is reduced by 1. The character must check his plating every time he suffers a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound**, and the reductions are cumulative.

A street doc can repair this damage—for a price. To repair 1 point of the plating's protection, a street doc normally charges 2,000¥ multiplied by the total number of points that the plating has lost. For example, a character whose dermal plating has been reduced by 2 points would be charged 4,000¥ to repair the first point (2,000¥ × 2) and another 2,000¥ to repair the second (2,000¥ × 1). The player character can modify this fee by making a standard **Negotiation Test**; each net success the character achieves lowers the final price by 5 percent. The actual work requires a biotech shop and a **Biotech (5) Test** with a Base Time of 4 hours per point. Technically, characters with the necessary skills and access to the necessary hardware can attempt these repairs on their own; the raw materials cost 400¥, multiplied by twice the number of points being repaired.

As stated in **Comfortably Numb** (p. 28), skin near dermal plating tends to heal poorly in the area of **Serious** or **Deadly Wounds**. Runners who wish to avoid scarring can buy a healing lotion that costs 20¥ per tube for 30 applications. For more information, see **Scarring**, p. 56.

#### DERMAL SHEATHING

Though similar in many ways to dermal plating, dermal sheathing is easier to care for and repair, though repairs are more expensive. Only a **Deadly Wound** can cause a permanent reduction in the rating of dermal sheathing. The base cost of repairs is 6,500¥ per point (1,400¥ raw materials cost); the work requires a **Biotech (4) Test** and takes a Base Time of 5 hours.

As long as the semi-artificial skin is sprayed with a chemical sealer within 12 hours of damage, there will be no scarring. The sealer spray costs 1,200¥ for 10 applications. If the damaged sheathing is not sprayed, Minor scarring occurs (see **Scarring**, p. 56).

A character cannot gain the benefits of both dermal plating and dermal sheathing. Sheathing is a superior form of plating and can only be fitted if pre-existing plating over the same area is removed. Note that orthoskin (p. 17, **Shadowtech**) is not compatible with dermal sheathing.

### CYBERLIMB SECONDARY DAMAGE

| Dice Roll Result | Secondary Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 2-4 | No effect, lucky you. |
| 5-7 | The limb twitches at random. Add a +1 modifier to target numbers for all tests using that limb. |
| 8-9 | On a 2D6 roll with a result of 10 or greater, the limb does not perform properly. The specific effect is up to the gamemaster. |
| 10-11 | On a 2D6 roll with a result of 8 or greater, the limb fails to perform properly. |
| 12 | The limb shuts down completely, except for an occasional twitch. |

---

#### ARMOR

As stated in **Comfortably Numb**, armor can be acquired for cyberlimbs, torsos and skulls. **Shadowrun** does not use a hit location system, and so player characters who want full protection must acquire armor for each of five possible hit locations: arms, legs, head, front of torso, and back of torso. To find the overall **Armor Rating**, add up the ratings of the individual pieces of armor and average the result, rounding down. For example, the hotshot street samurai Razor's Edge has 4 points of armor on his chest, 2 points covering his back, 2 points covering his legs, 2 points on his arms, and 1 point protecting his head. This gives him a total of 11 points of armor plating distributed around his body (4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 11). To find the average, divide the sum (11) by 5 (total possible hit locations). The result is 2.2, rounded down to 2, and so Razor's Edge has an overall Ballistic and Impact **Armor Rating** of 2. To keep players from doing such senseless things as putting all 10 points of armor in a cyberskull, the gamemaster may decree that any rating higher than 4 in any one area does not count for purposes of determining the overall **Armor Rating**. This limitation should ensure a sensible distribution of armor.

#### GENERAL RULES FOR CYBERLIMBS

Though simple replacement limbs with no special capabilities do exist in the world of **Shadowrun** (p. 249, SRII), most (if not all) shadowrunners who acquire cyberlimbs will buy the obviously cybernetic kind that can be modified and enhanced. The following rules apply to the latter type of cyberarm.

Pairs of cyberlimbs act as a layer of dermal plating, adding +1 to the character's **Body**. A character with a pair of cyberarms and a pair of cyberlegs adds +2 to his **Body**. Partial limbs, hands, and feet do not add to a character's **Body**.

Cyberhands and feet retain all the flexibility of their natural counterparts; in fact, they tend to move more fluidly than real hands or feet. A single cyberhand or foot adds +1 to the Power of unarmed combat attacks; any two cyberhands or feet (two hands, two feet, or one of each) adds +2 to the Power of unarmed combat attacks. More than two cyberhands or feet confer no additional bonus.

**Detecting Cyberlimbs**
The base target number for detecting an undisguised cyberlimb is 4, assuming a reasonably short period of interaction. If, for example, someone spends an entire evening at a bar in the company of a character with a cyberlimb, that base target number is reduced by a minimum -2 modifier. This modifier may drop as low as -4 at the gamemaster's discretion, depending on such factors as the duration, frequency, and continuity of observation. Cyberlimbs never move quite as naturally as the real thing, and after a while the onlooker will notice. A cyberlimb becomes even more obvious if a character is drunk; the artificial limb does not flail around with quite the right degree of abandon.

**Secondary Damage**
If a cyberlimb takes damage, roll 2D6 and consult the **Cyberlimb Secondary Damage** table to determine secondary effects.

#### Cyberwares-Cyberlimb Compatibility

When certain pieces of cyberware are wired into a cyberlimb, the limb reduces or eliminates the cyberware's Essence Cost. The **Cyberware-Cyberlimb Compatibility** table indicates the adjusted Essence Cost for the specific pieces to which this rule applies. In most cases, the Essence Cost of cyberware comes from the neural interface and secondary connections that allow control of the cyberware in question, and so the presence of a cyberlimb does not adjust Essence Cost.

---

### CYBERWARE-CYBERLIMB COMPATIBILITY

| | Adjusted Essence Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Fingertip Compartment** | 0 |
| **Spurs and Razors** (all kinds) | 0 |
| **Smartgun Links** (all kinds) | .25 |
| **Tactical Computer** | -25% (round down) |
| **Orientation System** | .25 |

---

**Cyberlimbs and Bone Lacing**
**Bone lacing** (p. 42, **Shadowtech**) cannot be performed on cyberlimbs. The armor value for bone lacing does not apply to cyberlimbs, though it does apply to a character's residual meat body. As a rule of thumb, characters can have two complete cyber replacements without losing bonuses for previously applied bone lacing. For characters with three cyber replacements, subtract 1 from bone lacing armor bonuses; for more than 3 replacements, all such bonuses are lost. (A single limb—such as the right arm or left leg—counts as one replacement for these purposes. Skulls and torsos count as a single replacement as well.)

#### STRENGTH ENHANCEMENTS

The following rules for **Strength enhancements** offer a new level of complexity, and so gamemasters and players alike should study them carefully before using them.

All cyberlimbs are assumed to have a built-in Strength of 3. If characters choose to enhance their cyberlimbs—or beef up their natural limbs with muscle replacement and/or augmentation—they may have to deal with problems that can surface when different limbs end up with different **Strength** ratings. (Imagine a character whose left arm has Strength 3, right arm Strength 5, a right leg Strength 7, and a left leg Strength 4. Yikes!)

If a character's various limbs have different **Strength** ratings, the true rating of any given limb can only be used in specific circumstances. The gamemaster must determine what happens in any given situation, as the possibilities are too numerous to devise rules for in detail. As a broad guideline, assume that if the character can apply a particular limb properly in a given situation, that limb's full **Strength Rating** can be used. For example, a character trying to pull up someone who has fallen over the edge of a building can use the true **Strength Rating** for the limb that is actually supporting the fallen person. In this same situation, the character cannot use the **Strength Ratings** of his other limbs unless he manages to get leverage or bracing that allows the application of strength from them. If a character manages to apply more than one limb in a given situation, use the average of all the **Strength Ratings** (round down) for those limbs.

Alternatively, the player's character may use an average **Strength Rating**—adding up the **Strength** ratings of all four limbs and then dividing by four (rounding down)—as the **Strength Rating** for melee combat. If the character also has muscle replacement or muscle augmentation, the appropriate **Strength** bonuses apply to all limbs equally and should be added to the Strength of each natural limb.

The player can have his character try to lead with the highest-strength limb the character possesses. This option allows a character to take full advantage of enhanced limbs. A player who makes this choice finds the average **Strength Rating** mentioned above and must apply a modifier to the target numbers for **Melee Combat Tests** equal to the difference between that average and the **Strength Rating** of the chosen limb. For example, a character with one arm at Strength 3, the other at Strength 5, a right leg at Strength 4 and a left leg at Strength 7 has an average **Strength Rating** 4. If this character wants to lead with his Strength 5 arm, he must fight with a +1 modifier to the target number for all **Melee Combat Tests** (5-4 = 1).

**Limitations**
Any single cyberlimb can only handle a maximum of 3 points of **Strength enhancement** before additional Essence and nuyen must be spent to modify the body to handle the extra stress. Each point of **strength enhancement** beyond 3 requires an additional .4 points of Essence and another 25,000¥. A character having his arm enhanced must undergo cybersurgery for the mounting reinforcement on the shoulder or elbow, depending on whether the character has a full cyberarm or a partial one. Enhancements to legs require cybersurgery on the hip for a full limb and the knee for a partial.

A character may possess an average augmented **Strength Rating** up to a maximum of twice his **Body**, or **Body** + 4, whichever is lower. A character with Body 3 can have an average **Strength Rating** no greater than 6; a troll character with Body 9 can have an average Strength no greater than 13.

**Partial Cyberlimbs**
Characters may boost the inherent strength of cyberhands and feet, but the boosted strength does not add to the Power of unarmed combat attacks. Such enhancements cost 65,000¥ per point of additional hand or foot strength to a maximum of +3 and cost no additional Essence. Increased hand strength can only be applied to gripping, not arm leverage.

Cyber lower arms and legs work like cyberhands and feet, except that strength enhancements for them cost 120,000¥ per point—60,000¥ if the adjacent hand or foot already has enhanced strength.

**Trolls and Cyberlimbs**
**Strength enhancements** for cyberlimbs apply differently to troll characters than to characters of other races. For non-troll characters, their relatively low Strength makes the hefty Essence losses for large Strength enhancements (+4 and up) of cyberlimbs reasonable—these characters are getting far more than their basic biology allows them to accommodate, and the invasive work needed to support the limb should entail big-time Essence loss. Trolls, by contrast, have an average Strength of 8. Under normal rules, a troll whose arm got ripped off would have to pay 2 Essence points to get a cyberarm that matched his average biological strength, with no bonuses at all. To compensate for this unfair penalty, treat the basic Strength of a cyberlimb for a troll as 8 instead of the usual 3. Cyberlimbs with **Strength enhancements** higher than 8 cost troll characters the standard .4 Essence loss per point.

#### QUICKNESS ENHANCEMENTS

**Quickness enhancements** to cyberlimbs must be balanced across a pair of limbs. A pair of cyberarms or a pair of cyberlegs must have the same level of Quickness enhancements. If they do not, the player character must apply a modifier equal to the difference between the limbs' **Quickness Ratings** to the target numbers for all tests involving movement or coordination of any kind. Modifiers from arm and leg pairs are cumulative.

Determine the average Quickness of multiple enhanced limbs as for Strength enhancements. Quickness altered in this manner affects **Reaction** and Initiative.

**Limitations**
As with **Strength enhancements**, any single cyberlimb can only handle a maximum of 3 points of **Quickness enhancement** before a player character must spend additional Essence and nuyen to modify the body to handle the extra stress. Each point of **Quickness enhancement** beyond 3 requires an additional .3 points of Essence and another 20,000¥. Cybersurgery is required for additional mounting reinforcement to the appropriate joint.

The maximum average enhanced Quickness a character can possess is equal to twice his natural Quickness (including any bioware the character may have) or Quickness + 4, whichever is lower. For example, a character with Quickness 3 can have an average enhanced **Quickness Rating** of no greater than 6; an elf character with Quickness 9 can have an average enhanced Quickness no greater than 13.

#### BODY ENHANCEMENTS

**Body enhancements** give a character protection above and beyond the equivalent layer of dermal armor received for each pair of cyberarms or legs. **Body enhancements** can only be applied to pairs of limbs, up to a maximum of an additional +3 Body per pair. A character with a pair of cyberarms and full **Body enhancements** would receive +3 to his **Body Rating**. If the character has cyberarms and cyberlegs with full **Body enhancements**, his **Body Rating** rises by +6.

**Body enhancements** cost no additional Essence. However, they bulk up a limb significantly, making it much more difficult to conceal its nature. For each point of **Body Enhancement** per pair of cyberlimbs, apply a -1 modifier to the target numbers of any visual **Perception Tests** made to notice and recognize cyberlimbs (see **Perception**, p. 185, SRII; also **Detecting Cyberlimbs**, p. 49).

#### MULTIPLE ENHANCEMENTS

Players who choose to give their characters multiple types of enhancements to the same limb will discover that the requirements and modifications for one type of enhancement are often at odds with those of another. To reflect this fact, add 10 percent to the purchase price of any additional enhancements. For example, a character who already has a **Strength enhancement** in one cyberarm must pay an additional 10 percent of the cost of **Quickness** or **Body enhancements** he wants to add. If the character adds Quickness and later adds Body, he must pay an extra 10 percent of the cost of the **Quickness enhancement** and 10 percent of the cost of the **Body enhancement**. If he wishes to add Quickness and Body enhancements at the same time, the costs for both increase by 10 percent.

#### DANGLING AND HOLDING

The introduction of the cyberlimb magnetic system begs the question of just how long a character can dangle, lift, and hold on in various situations. The character's weight, the weight of any object the character may be holding on to, and the character's **Strength, Body** and **Willpower** ratings may all come into play, depending on the specific action the character is trying to accomplish. Keep in mind that the following game mechanics do not accurately reflect all the possibilities in real-life situations. To spell out rules in such detail would require complex geometric progressions that only a mathematician could love. These rules are intended as rough guidelines to keep things simple, and gamemasters may modify them as they see fit.

A character's weight is determined by his **Body Rating**. Different races have different ratios of weight to Body points, as indicated by the racial averages listed on the table on p. 52. To determine a character's approximate weight, consult the **Weight to Body Table** and multiply the listed kilograms by the character's **Body Rating**.

---

### WEIGHT TO BODY TABLE

| Race | Kilograms per point of Body |
| :--- | :--- |
| Dwarf | 13 |
| Elf/Human | 24 |
| Ork | 16 |
| Troll | 28 |

---

Though actual weight may vary from character to character, using the **Weight to Body Table** allows the gamemaster to make a rough approximation. The weight-to-Body ratio also applies to increases in **Body** conferred by cyberware.

For each point of **Strength** a character with one cyberarm possesses, he can hold 15 kilograms with that arm. A character with two cyberarms can hold a total of 30 kilograms for each point of **Strength**. However, the character can only hold that weight without difficulty for a time period equal to the sum of his **Strength, Body**, and **Willpower** ratings, multiplied by 15 seconds. For example, an average human (Strength 3, Body 3, Willpower 3) can hold up to 45 kilograms (Strength 3 x 15 kilograms) for a base time of two minutes and fifteen seconds (9 x 15 seconds = 135 seconds, or 2 min. 15 sec.).

For every 5 kilograms or part thereof that the weight exceeds the character's limit, the base time is reduced by 20 percent (round up). For example, assume that an average human is trying to hold on to something that weighs 70 kilograms. The object in question is 25 kilograms over the character's weight limit (70-45 = 25), which means that the 20-percent reduction in the base holding time applies five times—once for every five extra kilograms (25 divided by 5 = 5). Twenty times 5 equals 100, and so the base holding time is reduced by 100 percent. This character has to struggle to hold on to the object right away.

If a character is holding something that weighs less than the maximum he can hang on to, the holding time rises by 10 percent (rounding up) for every 5 kilograms or portion thereof below the character's limit. For example, an average human is holding on to an object that weighs 30 kilograms, or 15 kilograms below that character's limit (45-30 = 15). The 10-percent increase in the base holding time applies three times (15 divided by 5 = 3), for a total increase of 30 percent. Thirty percent of 135 seconds equals 40.5 seconds; added to the base holding time of 2 minutes and 15 seconds, this means that the character can hold the object without difficulty for just under 3 minutes (2 minutes and 56 seconds).

Once a character reaches his limit, he must make a test pitting the sum of his **Strength** and **Willpower** ratings against a target number equal to the weight of the object being held divided by 15 (rounding up). For example, an average human holding on to a 45-kilogram load rolls 6 dice (Strength 3 + Willpower 3 = 6) against a Target Number 3 (45 kg divided by 15 = 3). If the test fails, the character drops the object. If the test is successful, the character holds on to the object for another 2 Combat Rounds (6 seconds). In the third Combat Round the character must make another test, with a +1 modifier to the target number. An additional +1 modifier applies to every subsequent test made to continue hanging on to the object.

Once the character reaches his limit he must also begin making **Damage Resistance Tests** against a Power Rating equal to the amount of weight he is attempting to hold, divided by 15 (rounding up). For example, an average human holding on to a 45-kilogram weight would make a **Damage Resistance Test** against a Target Number 3 (45 divided by 15 = 3). An average human attempting to hold 75 kilograms would make a **Damage Resistance Test** against a Target Number 5 (75 divided by 15 = 5).

Attempts to hold heavy objects cause Light Stun damage at first. The damage increases by one level for each multiple or part thereof of the base weight the character can hold, rounding up. Damage is taken immediately. An average human holding onto a 45-kilogram weight would make his **Damage Resistance Test** for Light Stun damage; the same character attempting to hold a 75-kilogram weight would make a **Damage Resistance Test** for Moderate Stun damage.

If a character attempts to hold on to an object that weighs less than 20 percent of the maximum, he can hold the object indefinitely. Excessively heavy weights are up to the gamemaster to decide. Player characters should get at least some chance to pull off the heroic, one-turn hanging-on act with something really heavy, but holding on to a rhino falling off a skyscraper is out of the question.

For dangling characters attempting to keep their grip on something, the character's weight functions as the maximum weight he can easily hold. When cumulative damage from the character's exertions renders the character unconscious, the character falls. If the gamemaster wishes, he may make a **Willpower (6) Test** for the character once the cumulative damage reaches the Deadly level. Success allows the character to hang on for a period of time determined by the gamemaster. If no successes are achieved, the character loses his grip and plummets. Keep in mind, however, that imposing this option is somewhat harsh for a character in such a life-or-death situation.

### CYBERGUNS

Cyberguns mounted in a cyberlimb cost no Essence. Cyberguns mounted in a natural limb or other body part do cost Essence, as indicated on the **Cybergun Essence Costs** table.

Additional rules for cyberguns appear on p. 86, **Street Samurai Catalog**, Second Edition.

### CYBERGUN ESSENCE COSTS

| Weapon | Essence Cost |
| :--- | :--- |
| Hold-out Pistol | .15 |
| Light Pistol | .35 |
| Machine Pistol | .4 |
| Submachine Gun | .6 |
| Heavy Pistol | 1 |
| Shotgun | 1.1 |

**CYBERARM GYROMOUNT**
The effective Strength employed for the purposes of recoil modifiers (p. 83, **Fields of Fire**) is the Strength of the cyberarm in which the gyromount is located, not the Strength of the character's meat body.

I will format and repair the text you provided. I will only fix spelling, formatting, and grammar errors, and I will not add any new content.

### CYBERSURGERY

Cybersurgery requires a skill test on the part of the performing surgeon. The surgeon may use the **Biotech (B/R) Skill** or one of its appropriate Concentrations or Specializations, or an appropriate **Special Skill** at the discretion of the gamemaster. The base target number for this skill test is equal to 10 minus the Essence that the character intends to end up with (rounding down). For example, if a character is having cyberware installed that would result in an Essence of 2.3, the Base Target Number would be 8 (10-2 = 8).

Appropriate modifiers to the skill test target number appear in the **Doctoring Table** (p. 113, SRII). The character is assumed to be in Intensive Care but may or may not have access to long-term magical care at the discretion of the gamemaster. Note, however, that alpha-, beta-, and delta-grade clinics always have healing magicians on staff. All other modifiers apply as needed.

These rules assume that the surgery is successful—medical science in 2056 has progressed to a point where table deaths are rare. The skill test determines exactly how well the cyber-implant surgery was performed, especially the delicate work of the neurological interface. The successes achieved by the doctor can raise or lower the actual Essence Cost of the cyberware being installed, as indicated on the **Essence Cost Change Table**.

Apply the percentage indicated to the Essence Cost of the piece of cyberware, rounding up. If the result would leave the character with less than 0 Essence, assume the surgery is aborted. The character survives, but with an Essence Rating of 0. If the character in question is at a delta clinic, cybermancy is an option (see **Cybermancy**, p. 64).

The gamemaster may choose not to reveal to the player his character's actual Essence Rating. Instead, the gamemaster may simply state what it rounds to for the purposes of magical healing. The character must then decide whether to risk additional cybersurgery at a later date.

Note that cybersurgery is elective surgery (pp. 114-115, SRII). In addition to the in-hospital healing time costs, the actual surgery also costs nuyen, as indicated on the following table.

| Successes | Essence Cost Change |

### EFFECTS OF WIRED REFLEXES

Characters with wired reflexes or any other kind of cybernetic reflex enhancements are prone to react without thinking, because they are constantly on edge. At the gamemaster's discretion, such a character tends to react reflexively in situations where a perceived threat exists, regardless of whether or not that threat is real. The unexpected appearance of a stranger or dangerous-looking people, a sudden threatening move or action, and a violent motion in a crowd are all things that might set off a wired character. In such situations, have the character make a **Perception Test** (p.185, SRII). Apply a +1 modifier to the target number per +1D6 Initiative bonus the character possesses. This modifier represents the character's tendency to react before fully analyzing the situation.

However, the character may also make a **Willpower Test** against the unmodified target number for the **Perception Test** to see if he can hold off his (probably destructive) reaction. The gamemaster should use this rule sparingly, as an occasional reminder of what it's like to live on the edge. Constantly subjecting the character to it will turn him into a hyperactive nervous wreck and won't be much fun for the player. Reserve this mental torture for appropriate situations—potentially threatening crowds, lonely dark streets, and particularly tense encounters.

---

### EFFECTS OF MOVE-BY-WIRE SYSTEMS

This piece of cyberware can make a character lethal in combat, but it has drawbacks to match its advantages. Putting the central nervous system into a state of constant seizure, as this system does, risks precipitating some unpleasant side effects: **TLE-x** (Temporal Lobe Epilepsy with complications) and **CCSS** (Catastrophic Clonic Seizure Syndrome).

To check for **TLE-x** and **CCSS**, the gamemaster makes Attribute Tests at regular intervals for players whose characters have the move-by-wire system. The average of the character's Body and Willpower ratings determines the number of dice used for the test. Magical bonuses to Attributes do not apply to these tests; round fractions down. The maximum augmentation of a character's **Body Rating** from cyber enhancements is +2, as these enhancements have a limited capacity to affect the chances of the character's brain going AWOL. The frequency of the tests and the relevant target numbers depend on the level of move-by-wire system the character possesses, as shown on the **Complication Test Table**.

The gamemaster can make these tests at scheduled dates or after a character experiences excessive physical or emotional stress. The tests should be made when the character is unaffected by any spells that might temporarily boost relevant Attributes, as **TLE-x** or **CCSS** are more likely to occur when an individual has weakened resistance. If the gamemaster achieves 2 successes, the character avoids complications. One success means that the character has developed **TLE-x**. If no successes are achieved, the character has developed **CCSS** or both **CCSS** and **TLE-x**, at the gamemaster's discretion.

---

### COMPLICATION TEST TABLE

| Move-by-Wire Level | Test Frequency | Target Number |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Every 6 months | 3 |
| 2 | Every 4 months | 4 |
| 3 | Every 4 months | 5 |
| 4 | Every 3 months | 6 |

---

If the test fails, the character collapses in an epileptic seizure and suffers 6M Damage. The individual becomes unconscious after 10 x 1D6 Combat Turns and remains out cold for 10 x 1D6 minutes.

**CCSS**
**CCSS** is a catastrophic breakdown of brain functions. Chronic seizures grip all major perceptual, motor and associative regions. Basic vegetative functions such as breathing work more or less normally, but the affected character is incapable of voluntary action and is barely aware of what is happening around him. He experiences the world as a terrifying, whirling chaos of nightmarish sensations and intense pain.

**CCSS** renders a victim's move-by-wire system permanently dysfunctional and it must be removed. If a character with **CCSS** cannot find a doctor to perform the necessary treatments, he must make a successful (Unaugmented) **Body (5) Test** every hour or the character dies. For characters who undergo treatment, long-term rehabilitation is required. Such rehabilitation must last (10 - Unaugmented Body) weeks, to a minimum of 5, and includes intensive care, corrective brain surgery, enough drugs to sink the Titanic, and lots more (at a cost of 50,000¥ per week).

Of course, simply undergoing surgery and follow-up treatment is no guarantee that the character will be just fine. To determine possible long-term damage from **CCSS**, the treating physician makes a **Biotech/Transimplant Surgery (10) Test**. The **CCSS Recovery Table** indicates the effects of various roll results. If the physician achieves no successes, for example, the patient suffers Damage Level 4; his Strength, Quickness, and Willpower are all permanently reduced by 1, and his Intelligence level becomes 0—he lives, but with no more mind than a hairbrush. At least 1 success means the patient eventually returns to near normal functioning, although he suffers the permanent reductions in Attributes as shown on the table. Note these rules assume the best possible medical care; this work can only be performed in an intensive-care unit. Any attempt to perform this work outside such a facility fails automatically.

---

### CCSS RECOVERY TABLE

| Successes | Damage Level | Effects |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6 | 1 | -1 Quickness and Willpower |
| 4 | 2 | -1 Quickness, Intelligence, and Willpower |
| 2 | 3 | -1 Strength, Quickness, and Willpower; -2 Intelligence |
| 0 | 4 | -1 Strength, Quickness, and Willpower; Intelligence level 0 (you lucky lobotomy case, you). Adaptation to the social world is possible at the level of a family pet. |

---

**TLE-x**
**TLE-x** is a condition loosely based on basic **TLE** syndrome. Feelings of alienation, depersonalization, and perceptual distortions characterize the condition. Coordination of perceptions and actions, and judging spatial relationships becomes difficult due to a secondary focus developing in the motor systems. In circumstances that the gamemaster deems dangerous or tactically crucial—such as whether an individual notices some clue or sign—a +2 penalty is applied to target numbers for **Perception Tests**, Initiative is reduced by 2, and Reaction is reduced by 1D6. The character also suffers a -1 penalty to Charisma and all Charisma-based skills in important social situations; the depersonalization and alienation make his social responses subtly inappropriate.

**TLE-x** can be treated by a physician who makes a successful **Biotech/Transimplant Surgery (8) Test**. However, this procedure cuts away a small area of brain tissue that has become chronically dysfunctional, and the guy in the white coat can only do this a limited number of times. A second occurrence of the syndrome can be treated with a successful **Biotech/Transimplant Surgery (10) Test**. After that the condition becomes chronic and cannot be corrected. In the case of chronic **TLE-x**, the epileptic foci can spread and the unfortunate victim can develop exciting and romantic afflictions like impotence and incontinence. The gamemaster may decrease Social skills and Charisma as he sees fit.

The individual with chronic **TLE-x** may also suffer acute seizures. If such a character suffers a Moderate or worse) Wound and is engaged in combat or some other type of conflict, the player must make a **Willpower (6) Test**. If the test fails, he suffers 6M Stun damage (or one damage level higher than the original attack, whichever is worse) and falls to the ground in a seizure, remaining unconscious for 10 x 1D6 Combat Turns. This check is made after all damage has been resolved.

---

### SCARRING

For players who want to know when their characters get scars and how nasty they are, use the following guidelines. Whenever a character takes a **Serious** or **Deadly Wound**, have him make a **Body Test** against a target number equal to the number of boxes of damage taken. Apply the appropriate target number modifiers listed in the **Scarring Modifiers Table**.

---

### SCARRING MODIFIERS TABLE

| Treatment Conditions | Modifier |
| :--- | :--- |
| Intensive care (in hospital) | -4 |
| Not in hospital or clinic | +2 |
| Bad conditions (Barrens, slums, etc.) | +4 |
| Terrible conditions (cesspool, sewer, etc.) | +6 |
| Character was magically healed of half or more of the damage | -4 |
| Character was magically healed of some of the damage | -2 |
| Character has dermal plating | +3 |
| Character has dermal sheathing or some form of semi-artificial skin | +2 |
| Character has proper healing salve for dermal plating or dermal sheathing | -2 |

---

After making the test, count the successes and consult the **Scarring Table**. A **Terrible** scar is large, ugly, and impossible not to notice. A **Major** scar refers to noticeable disfigurement or discoloration. A **Noticeable** scar is visible but not particularly noteworthy. A **Minor** scar is barely noticeable. Minor cosmetic surgery can eliminate all except Terrible scars, if the player character wishes to pay for it. Minor invasive cosmetic surgery can reduce a Terrible scar to a Minor one (see **Elective Surgery**, pp. 114-115, SRII).

| 5+ | Minor |

### CYBERWARE AND BIOWARE

Bioware may have greatly reduced effects on heavily cybered characters. In some instances, bioware and cyberware may produce adverse reactions. The following text applies to biotech described in the **Shadowtech** sourcebook. Bioware items not mentioned in this section function normally, regardless of a character's cybertech implantations.

**ADRENAL PUMP**
The less meat there is to stimulate, the less effective adrenal augmentation becomes. Assuming that an adrenal pump works at 100 percent efficiency in a body with no cyberware, the gamemaster should reduce the efficiency of the adrenal pump by 15 percent for each cyberlimb, 10 percent for each partial cyberlimb, 5 percent for each cyberhand or foot, and by 20 percent for a cybertorso. Reductions for partial cyberlimbs and cyberhands and feet are cumulative.

The total reduction of efficiency determines how much of the bioware's usual bonus the cybered character receives. A cyberleg, a cyberhand, and a cybertorso reduce the adrenal pump's efficiency by 40 percent (15 + 5 + 20 = 40). If a character has those cyber enhancements, he receives only 60 percent of the usual bonus provided by his adrenal pump. This reduction would affect a Level 2 adrenal pump as follows. The usual bonuses conferred by such a pump are +2 to Quickness, Strength, and Willpower, and +4 to Reaction. Sixty percent of +2 equals 1.2 (2 x .60 = 1.2), rounded down to 1, and so the bonus to Quickness, Strength, and Willpower drops to +1. Sixty percent of +4 equals 2.4 (4 x .60 = 2.4), rounded down to 2; the character's Reaction bonus drops to +2.

Adrenal pumps do not function in conjunction with move-by-wire systems, because the combination produces violent and uncontrollable responses completely out of proportion to stimuli and the body's natural reflexes. Such catastrophic overstimulation is totally unworkable. The **Reaction Enhancer** system described on p. 38 of **Comfortably Numb** reduces the normal bonuses for the adrenal pump by 50 percent.

**DAMAGE COMPENSATOR**
The damage compensator does not affect the functions of cyberlimbs or reduce damage to them.

**ENHANCED ARTICULATION**
This systemic implant cannot be integrated into a cyberlimb. The Reaction gain conferred by enhanced articulation is lost if the character gains a Reaction bonus from Quickness-enhanced cyberlimbs or if more than two of the character's limbs are partly or wholly replaced by cyberlimbs. Because enhanced articulation is system-wide and different limbs do not have different Reaction Ratings (the mind truly boggles at this possibility), there is no need to come up with formulas for individual limbs.

**MUSCLE REPLACEMENT /AUGMENTATION**
Standard rules for muscle replacement (p. 249, SRII) and muscle augmentation (p. 35, **Shadowtech**) assume that the muscle/strength increase is applied equally across all the muscle groups in the body. Unless a character already has one or more cyberlimbs, muscle replacement or augmentation can only be accomplished in this way. The presence of cyberlimbs reduces the Essence Cost and the purchase price for each point of muscle replacement or augmentation by 20 percent (round fractions up) per cyberlimb. Note that this rules clarification may create a strength imbalance; different parts of the body may have different strength bonuses. For applicable rules, see **Strength Enhancements**, p. 50.

**SUPRATHYROID GLAND**
Cyber enhancements affect suprathyroid glands in the same manner as adrenal pumps. Note that only major-scale bodyware/cyberlimb replacements render the suprathyroid gland useless. Like the adrenal pump, suprathyroid glands are incompatible with the move-by-wire systems.

**SYNAPTIC ACCELERATOR**
Synaptic accelerators may be integrated with move-by-wire systems only with considerable difficulty. To date, medical specialists have successfully combined only Level 1 synaptic accelerators with move-by-wire systems, and the integration of the two requires extreme care. If a character wants the combination, triple the normal cost for the synaptic accelerator. Move-by-wire systems can only be implanted simultaneously with synaptic accelerators. Characters who already possess accelerators cannot receive move-by-wire systems, and vice versa.

**SYNTHACARDIUM**
The customary bonus synthacardiums provide to Athletics-based tests is not cumulative with any bonuses from cyberlimbs.

---

### CYBERWARE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION

As noted in various **Shadowrun** products, heavily chromed individuals tend to suffer social disapproval (when did you last have a fun conversation with someone who looked like a vending machine?). To simulate this reality, the gamemaster may use the following optional rules in appropriate social situations and when cybered characters are dealing with contacts.

**SOCIAL SITUATIONS**
In some social situations, having lots of cybertech is no big deal. The Johnson hiring runners may actually be reassured at the sight of would-be employees who look like they can really take care of themselves (he may decide he doesn't like them much as human beings, but that's not the point). Interrogations and other situations where runners are in a position of strength, or dealings with people who are used to heavily chromed individuals (the military, research scientists, and so on) also pose few problems.

However, excessive cyberware should be a liability for most casual social interactions. If a runner is trying to get some information from a stranger or a person he knows only slightly at a shop or in a bar, walking in with a look that says "I use metal polish every day" is a real no-no. Gamemasters may reflect this in game play with the following modifier to Charisma or Charisma-based **Skill Tests**: +1 to all target numbers for every 2 points of Essence (or portion thereof above .5) below the normal Essence Attribute of 6.

The gamemaster may adapt this modifier based on the visibility of the cyberware. For cyberware that is invisible to normal senses, such as headware memory, skillsofts, cortex bombs, and the like, the +1 modifier may not apply at all. Datajacks should be ignored: these items are so common that they cause no social disapproval (unless the character has them mounted somewhere very strange indeed). Wired reflexes and cyberware that primarily affects movement, such as move-by-wire systems, should have a modifier; even though the actual cyberware may not be visible, its effects are immediately apparent. Disguised cyberware, such as cyberlimbs with semi-natural covering, may or may not require a modifier depending on the results of **Perception Tests** needed to spot them.

The +1 modifier should apply to any cyberware the gamemaster deems flagrant in appearance (lurid cybereyes, steely cyberarms over which a character wears nothing but headache-inducing short-sleeved Hawaiian shirts, and so on).

Additional modifiers are the gamemaster's call, depending on the situation. For example, a runner chatting at the bar with the staff of a newssheet devoted to cutting-edge cybertech is not going to attract anywhere near the negative attention of a street samurai conversing with back-to-nature elves who shudder at the very thought of implanting metal into themselves. However, the gamemaster should always apply a minimum modifier of +1 for a character with Essence loss greater than 3.0, unless the circumstances are exceptional.

Subtle and tricky situations arise when characters use offsetting factors such as tailored pheromones (p. 18, **Shadowtech**). Such things can completely eliminate the Charisma penalty of obvious cyberware. However, the person talking to such a runner should not behave as they would to a normal individual. They know the runner is strange and different, not quite human (or metahuman) in the same way they are. The possible situations that can arise are infinite, and the gamemaster must use his own judgment when dealing with them.

**CONTACTS**
Runners with excessive cyberware appear dangerous to other people and may lose contacts as people begin to shun them. Contacts who work with cybertechnology or cybered individuals on a regular basis may have no problem dealing with heavily cybered runners, but in other cases the gamemaster should consider making over-chromed runners work hard to keep the contacts they have. The gamemaster should require a periodic **Charisma Test** to see if a given contact is still friendly to the runner, or if the contact will take at least minimal steps to avoid that runner because of a developing aversion. The base target number for these tests is 3. Apply Essence-loss modifiers as described in **Social Situations** as well. For contacts, however, the +1 modifier should apply even in cases where cyberware is not obvious. This rule assumes that a given runner's contact knows the runner well enough or has been around him enough to see, feel or intuit the effects of any cyberware. In general, this **Charisma Test** should be made once per run, when the runner first seeks out the contact. If a gamemaster has players whose runners go out every weekday and night, the test may be made less frequently. These tests should be made for all characters whose Essence loss from cyberware implantation exceeds 0.5; datajacks can be ignored at the gamemaster's discretion. The effects of the **Charisma Test** depend on the number of successes achieved, as indicated on the **Contact Reactions Table**.

---

### CONTACT REACTIONS TABLE

| Successes | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| 4+ | Contact remains unaffected. |
| 3 | Contact is slightly aloof or cold. |
| 2 | Contact initially attempts to avoid the runner. Apply a +1 modifier to target numbers for all subsequent Charisma or Social Skill tests. |
| 1 | Contact consistently attempts to avoid the runner without going to excessive lengths. |
| 0 | Apply a +1 modifier to the target number for all subsequent Charisma or Social Skill tests. |
| | Contact shuns runner and refuses to help him unless coerced. |

---

A cybered runner should not lose more than one contact per test period. The gamemaster may make fresh tests for all contacts the first time they meet the runner after he has additional cyberware implanted, using the **Contact Reactions Table** to determine their reactions. The gamemaster may allow runners to avoid these penalties if they make active attempts to keep on their contacts' good sides. Make the players work at this; simply buying their contacts drinks or handing over money won't do. Runners must use a more personal touch—a thoughtful gift, some news about someone important to that contact, or some other action to demonstrate to the contact that the humanity they sensed was absent from the runner is not actually lost.

---

### CYBERMANCY

Until now, the Essence costs of cyberware have limited the amount of cyberware **Shadowrun** characters could possess. Too much cyberware would have reduced the character's Essence below 0, effectively killing the character. The new cybermancy rules, however, enable characters and NPCs to remain "alive" even when their **Essence Ratings** drop below 0. This means that characters may have a nearly unlimited amount of cyberware—provided they are willing to suffer the various side effects of a cybermantically sustained existence. This section provides rules for performing cybersurgery/cybermancy operations and for these side effects.

**FINDING THE RIGHT PLACE**
Cybermancy is not available everywhere. In fact, cybersurgery that lowers a character's Essence below 0 can be performed only at delta clinics. Unlike alpha and beta clinics (see pp. 98-99, **Street Samurai Catalog**), characters cannot simply find one of the world's few ultra-secret delta clinics in the local phone book or hear about one from friends. And even if a character does stumble across such a clinic by some rare cosmic coincidence, he cannot simply walk right in and get some work done. Every delta clinic operates under the tight control of a megacorp or nation-state. And the staffs at these clinics do no work for anyone unless their bosses order them to do so.

Therefore, individual gamemasters may decide whether or not to allow cybermancy in their games. Gamemasters who choose to incorporate cybermancy should keep in mind that characters cannot start the game with an **Essence Rating** below 0. Because of this rule—and because of the potential impact of cybermancy on **Shadowrun** games—cybermancy should be connected to some plot element in a story. Gamemasters should ensure that becoming a cyberzombie is an extended, difficult endeavor full of extensive roleplaying—rather than a matter of simple dice rolls.

For example, a megacorp might provide a player character access to a delta clinic in exchange for some extremely important work, or as a reward for some service yet to be performed. In the latter case, the character should perform one heck of a service and the megacorp should have an excellent reason for trusting that the runner will come through with the goods. Hatchetman, for instance, performed a run that virtually saved a megacorp from destruction. He got scragged in the process, so his employer decided to reward him by fixing him up better than new. Of course, he was also a convenient guinea pig. Regardless of why the megacorp patched him up in the first place, Hatchetman now owes the corp big time. And the corp expects him to be extremely grateful when they decide to call in that marker.

**GROUND RULES**
For game purposes, any character who undergoes cybersurgery that reduces his Essence below 0 automatically undergoes cybermancy at the time of the surgery. Only delta clinics may perform these procedures. (No rules are provided for the actual cybermantic ritual. See **Cybermantic Magic**, p. 84, for further information.)

The **Less Than Zero** section provides rules for the cybersurgery/cybermancy procedure. During the procedure, the character receives an implanted automatic-medication system that feeds him special drugs, nutrients, and other substances that will keep his technically dead body alive. The installation of the automatic-medication system costs nothing, but refills of the medicine cost 15,000¥ each and must be purchased every 10 days. If the system runs out of medicine, the character dies immediately. If the corp authorizing the cybersurgery/cybermancy really likes the character, it might swing him a discount of 1D6 x 5 percent on refills. If the corp has something special in mind for the character, it might even pick up the entire tab—a practice that provides the character with a strong motivation for following orders.

**LESS THAN ZERO**
The cybersurgery/cybermancy procedure is a highly dangerous operation. Unlike regular cybersurgery, which entails no real risk of failure, a character undergoing a cybersurgery/cybermancy operation may well die on the table. The chance of death increases the further the character's Essence drops below 0.

To determine whether or not the character survives the cybersurgery/cybermancy procedure, the gamemaster makes a **Biotech** or appropriate medical skill test for the performing doctor. The target number for the test is determined by the **Essence Rating** the character will have if the cybersurgery succeeds. All characters undergoing cybermantic operations automatically receive an **Invoked memory stimulator (IMS)**, which carries an Essence Cost of .25 and a price of 137,750¥. Include this Essence Cost when calculating the intended **Essence Rating** of the operation. Then consult the **Cybersurgery/Cybermancy Survival Table** for the target number.

To determine target numbers for intended **Essence Ratings** lower than those listed, continue the progression shown on the table. Technically there is no lower limit, but the possibility of surviving the procedure becomes vanishingly small as the character's Essence drops farther and farther below 0.

Apply all appropriate modifiers listed on the **Doctoring Table** (p. 113, SRII), except for the -2 modifier for intensive care (delta clinics are automatically considered intensive-care facilities). Note that the Willpower-enhancing magic of the cybermantic ritual (**Changes to Willpower**, p. 82) does not apply in this test.

If the test fails, the character dies. That's it. The player cannot spend Karma on the doctor's skill test to enhance his chances. If the test succeeds, the character lives. To determine how well the doctor did his job and modify the actual Essence cost of the procedure accordingly, see **Cybersurgery**, p. 53.

### SIDE EFFECTS

The actual cybersurgery/cybermancy operation is by far the riskiest part of using cybermancy. However, a successful operation does not mean the character is in the clear. When a character undergoes a cybermantic operation, he becomes the central participant in a magical ritual intended to fool his spirit into staying with his body. As a result, cybermantic techniques inflict several potentially lethal conditions and side effects on the character. One such condition, the need for an automatic-medication system, is described in **Ground Rules**. Other side effects are described in the following passages.

**BETTER OFF DEAD**
Ironically, cybermancy makes dying easier for a character, because it reduces the character's **Physical Damage Overflow** value (**Body Rating** + 10) by half (round up). (For more information on **Physical Damage Overflow**, see **Exceeding the Condition Monitor**, p. 111, SRII.) The odds are that the character has boosted his **Body Rating** by at least one piece of cyberware or bioware, so initially this side effect does not pose too much of a problem.

However, every time the character experiences **Physical Damage Overflow** and is healed or stabilized, the character must make a **Willpower Test** against a target number equal to twice the amount of overflow damage. If the test fails the character dies, regardless of any magical or mundane healing measures applied. The character may spend Karma to prevent this, and cybermantic adjustments to Willpower apply to the test as well (see **Changes to Willpower**, p. 82).

**MAGICAL SIDE EFFECTS**
Characters who undergo cybermantic treatment become more resistant to magic. To reflect this side effect, add twice the absolute value of the character's **Essence Rating** to the target number of any magical test made against him. (The absolute value of -2 is 2, for example.) Unfortunately for the character, this modifier also applies to magical tests used for healing.

Cybermantic techniques also give a character an astral presence—the enchantments woven into his body shine like beacons on the astral plane. This has the same effect as if the character were constantly astrally perceiving—except that the character cannot actually see or sense astral space. The character has no awareness of astral space at all. Yes, this means the character can be attacked in astral space. Those are the breaks, chummer.

**Karma Hazing**
The term "karma hazing" was coined by a specific hermetic organization whose members apparently know more about this phenomenon than anyone else. They call it karma hazing because they believe that individuals with sub-zero Essence generate permanent astral pollution that may prove disastrous for the collective Karma of (meta)humanity.

Karma hazing makes the cybermantic character's astral presence increasingly noticeable to astrally active individuals and creatures, who can sense it far beyond normal ranges for assensing or astral awareness. Increasingly, the character's astral presence registers as a black shadow, a polluted zone. To all who can sense it, it somehow feels wrong. Astrally active creatures and individuals either shun the affected character or take hostile action against him, and astral predators may be drawn to his vicinity. Wraiths (p.110, **Paranormal Animals of Europe**) seem particularly sensitive to karma-hazed individuals.

The gamemaster may approach karma hazing in several ways. Most simply, he may ignore it—after all, the risks of dissociation and cancer caused by cybermancy are bad enough. Also, any megacorp that authorizes cybermancy for a character will protect their investment by ensuring that their mages do their damnedest to disguise the astral signature of a cybermantically sustained character.

Alternatively, the gamemaster may make a periodic **Essence (4) Test** for the character—every month or so, say, or during a run—treating the character's **Essence Rating** as positive for the purposes of the test (round fractions up). If the gamemaster achieves any successes, sooner or later something takes an active and hostile interest in the character. This something may be a critter wandering around the astral or a much more dangerous entity with a much more specific purpose. This hostile attention can form the basis for an entire adventure in which the character must shake off the astral menace.

**CHANGES TO REACTION / PERCEPTION**
For every point of negative Essence or part thereof that a character has, he receives a +1 modifier to all **Reaction Tests** made when he is taken by surprise (see **Surprise**, p. 86, SRII). For example, a character with an **Essence Rating** -1.3 would receive a +2 modifier to his Reaction Tests in these circumstances.

Additionally, a character receives a +2 modifier to all **Perception Tests** for every point of negative Essence or part thereof. In situations where a character is deliberately searching for or expecting something, he can reduce the **Perception Test** modifier by making a **Willpower Test** against a target number equal to three times the absolute value of his **Essence Rating** (round up). Each success from this test reduces the **Perception Test** modifier by 1.

**Lost in the Details**
Sometimes a cybermantically sustained character can get lost in the details of what he is observing. Whenever a character achieves all successes on **Perception Tests** with modified Target Numbers of 5 or more, this occurs. To break free, the character may immediately make a **Willpower Test** against the target number of the **Perception Test**. If the **Willpower Test** fails, the character remains lost in concentration.

The player may repeat the **Willpower Test** in every following Combat Turn or once per minute if not in combat. The target number increases by 1 each time the test is repeated. If the player fails 5 tests in a row, his **invoked memory stimulator** kicks in and the target number begins to drop by 1 per each Combat Turn or minute, whichever is more frequent.

Other characters may attempt to attract the cybermantic character's attention as well. Each such attempt reduces the **Willpower Test** target number by 1. During Combat Turns, characters must spend Simple Actions to make these attempts.

**CHANGES TO WILLPOWER**
For every half point of negative Essence or part thereof that a character has, his **Willpower Rating** is reduced by 1. A character with an **Essence Rating** of -.75, for example, would experience a Willpower Rating reduction of 2.

However, the cybermantic process magically restores up to 4 points of Willpower lost because of negative Essence. Note that cybermantic magic cannot increase the character's Willpower beyond the rating he possessed before undergoing cybermancy.

The character is also immune to any form of magic that can increase his Willpower Attribute, such as the **Increase Attribute** spell. Additionally, the cybermantic Willpower increase cannot be dispelled or broken and is not affected if magic is grounded into the character's body from astral space.

**INVOKED MEMORY STIMULATOR**
Whenever a cybermantically sustained character's **invoked memory stimulator (IMS)** kicks in, it dredges up various of the character's memories to keep him from slipping away. The character hears voices, sees faces, remembers people long dead or long forgotten, remembers good times and terrible times. The **IMS** and the memories it provoke have no specific game effects, but the gamemaster should use invoked memories as a roleplaying or storytelling tool. On occasion the character may even confuse memory with reality, and the gamemaster should feel free to mix and match reality with various memories as seems appropriate. However, keep in mind that this kind of confusion does not occur very often.

**SOCIAL AND KARMA PENALTIES**
A sub-zero **Essence Rating** causes characters to act strangely in social situations. To reflect this side effect, add the absolute value of the character's **Essence Rating** to the target numbers for all the character's Charisma and social-skill based tests (round fractions up). For **Essence Ratings** below -2, double the penalty for the amount below -2.

### CHRONIC DISSOCIATION SYNDROME TABLE

| Essence Rating | Test Frequency |
| :--- | :--- |
| -0.05 to -0.50 | 1 every 6 months |
| -0.55 to -1.00 | 1 every 6 months |
| -1.05 to -1.50 | 1 every 6 months |
| -1.55 to -2.00 | 1 every 4 months |
| -2.05 to -2.50 | 1 every 4 months |
| -2.55 to -3.00 | 1 every 3 months |
| -3.05 to -3.50 | 1 every 2 months |
| -3.55 or lower | 1 every 2 months |

---

For example, a character with an **Essence Rating** of -3 receives a +4 modifier to appropriate target numbers: 2 for the first 2 points of negative Essence, plus 2 for the remaining point (1 x 2 = 2). A character with an **Essence Rating** of -3.5 receives a +5 modifier: 2 for the first 2 points of negative Essence, plus 3 for the remaining 1.5 points (1.5 x 2 = 3).

These penalties apply even if a strong emotional bond once existed between the character and the individual he is interacting with. Gamemasters may increase the penalties in such circumstances, because people who once knew the character well may be especially disconcerted by his strange behavior.

Cybermantic characters cannot compensate for their loss of social skills by any magical means. The character has crossed an absolute threshold, and anyone who meets him knows this at a gut, heart, and brain level.

These social modifiers do not apply in situations where the character intentionally intimidates others, such as an interrogation. In fact, the gamemaster may even use the character's **Essence Rating** to reduce the target numbers of tests in such situations.

Sub-zero Essence also reduces a character's ability to accumulate and use Karma. Such characters gain Karma at one-half the usual rate (p. 190, SRII). Additionally, characters cannot regain lost Essence by spending Good Karma.

**LONG-TERM EFFECTS**
Cybermantic treatments also may produce long-term side effects that may not be immediately apparent. These effects include chronic dissociation syndrome and cancer. (Hey, chummer, you're the one who wanted to be a walking dead guy. Deal with it.)

**CHRONIC DISSOCIATION SYNDROME**
Chronic dissociation syndrome (**CDS**) occurs when a character's response to his **invoked memory stimulator (IMS)** deteriorates. The **IMS** continues to provoke memories in the character's mind, but he ceases to respond to them in the same way. Instead, he experiences the memories as alien to himself. The memories produce the same disruptive effects described in **Invoked Memory Stimulator** and they gradually lose their power to "anchor" the character to the real world as well. The images that occupy him are devoid of meaning, a jumble of disconnected events and appearances that serve only to confuse and painfully remind the character of the life he once had. The character loses the will to live and seems to fade away from the land of the living, his last days spent in a soulless catatonic state.

The gamemaster makes periodic **Willpower Tests** to determine whether a character develops **CDS**. The frequency and target number for the tests are determined by the character's **Essence Rating** as shown on the **Chronic Dissociation Syndrome Table**. Willpower modifiers from cybermantic magic apply to this test, but similar modifiers from any other shorter-term magical source do not.

If a **Willpower Test** fails, **CDS** has set in and the character is lost to the world. He cannot initiate action, only react. For example, the character cannot initiate combat but can defend himself against attacks. **CDS** adds a +4 modifier to all **Perception Tests** the character makes and a +3 modifier for all other tests. Note that these modifiers are in addition to any other modifiers already applied to the character's tests.

The character sickens, will not eat, develops untreatable insomnia and dies in a number of weeks equal to 3 + his **Willpower Rating**.

Chronic dissociation syndrome is treatable magically, but only trained magicians—those capable of performing the original cybermantic rituals—can perform the treatment. (They don't teach the tricks of the trade either, for damned good reasons.) Assuming the treatment is conducted in a delta clinic, the afflicted character makes a **Spell Resistance (8) Test**. If the test succeeds, the magic fails and the character dies. If the **Spell Resistance Test** fails, the syndrome is reversed and the character's **IMS** begins to function effectively, though it takes a few days for this to happen. The character makes a **Willpower (6) Test** to determine how quickly this recovery occurs. The base time for this recovery is 1 week; each success on the **Willpower Test** shortens the recovery time by 1 day.

**CDS** treatment becomes increasingly difficult each time the syndrome sets in, so reduce the target number for the **Spell Resistance Test** by 1 each time a character repeats the test. The target number may never drop below 2, however.

**CANCER**
Cybermancy produces an artificial, forced alliance between a character's body and spirit. Magical and technological trickery is used to "fool" the spirit into staying, but this means that the body as well as the spirit develops problems.

Just as the insidious sickness of the spirit manifests as karma hazing, the body's sickness manifests as cancer. At a very deep, primal level, the body knows that the spirit is not truly present in it. As a result, the P46-gatekeeper/MIC gene systems present in every (meta)human, which normally instruct body cells to die in a pre-programmed fashion, no longer send the right biochemical signals. Cells that should die remain alive and become cancerous. At the same time, cells that should stay alive die, and the body necrotizes. This is a ghastly end.

To determine whether the character will suffer this particular long-term effect, roll 2D6 during the initial cybermantic operation. If the result is less than double the absolute value of the character's intended **Essence Rating**, the character will eventually develop cancer (if he lives long enough). At the gamemaster's discretion, the roll result may be increased by 1 if the character's unaugmented **Body Rating** is between 4 and 7, and by 2 if the **Body Rating** is 8 or better—high **Body Ratings** reduce the chances of cancer developing. If the individual has circulating symbiotes (p. 15, **Shadowtech**), the dice roll result can be increased by 1 at the gamemaster's discretion.

If the test fails, the character will develop cancer after 10D6 months. The cancer will be fast-growing, extremely nasty, and incurable. It will kill the character within 5 to 10 weeks of its appearance (4 + 1D6). The gamemaster decides when to inform the player of his character's condition.

**CYBERMANTIC MAGIC**
This book provides no rules for the spells, rituals and magical operations involved in cybermancy simply because shadowrunners are never going to be able to use them. Even if by some wild stretch of the imagination a player character managed to learn cybermantic techniques, the knowledge would be worth nothing unless he also had access to a delta clinic and a dedicated medical staff at his beck and call for weeks on end (which isn't going to happen).

The **Magic and Death** section indicates the tasks involved in cybermantic magic. The ritual requires a dedicated group, takes at least 24 hours to accomplish, involves the equivalent of an astral quest (though nowhere near as difficult as the usual kind, unless the subject of the magical treatment is intended to end up with a very low Essence), and also involves powerful spirits in some way. Usually these are **Spirits of Man**, though a certain organization has learned to employ blood spirits instead. Finally, some extended form of metamagical centering is used to focus the spirit of the subject to enhance the magical "anchoring" of that spirit to the body.

The drain produced by the ritual is stupefying—players and gamemasters shouldn't even want to think about the number of dice rolls that would be needed to simulate it (and all those double-digit Damage codes get really depressing after a while). Even high-level initiates of a hermetic group, who can use extra-effective **Centering** techniques against Drain, think more than twice about it when they're preparing for the ritual.

Only a small number of hermetic organizations know the rituals necessary for cybermantic magic. They are not owners or major shakers in corporations, but they willingly work for corporate interests and instruct a few corporate mages in just enough of the techniques to enable them to perform cybermancy. They do not teach the corp mages quite enough to pull off the really heavy-duty stuff, such as taking Essence below -3. And these organizations only teach those corporate mages who have donated blood, skin, bonded foci and similar elements of their magical selves as assurances of their good behavior, to ensure that the students will never pose a threat to their instructors. They make sure that when it comes to the really big numbers, they must be called in personally. And their fees are high enough to buy a Fairlight with the change.

**Magic and Death** gives some hints on why these organizations do this. Money is one obvious motive, but big-time hermetics are rarely motivated by greed alone. To some extent, the power gained by becoming a big-gun cybermancer motivates some. Of course, these organizations may have far more important motives.

If a player thinks about having his character hit that delta clinic, don't let him forget into whose hands he might be putting himself. Let him worry a little about it before he makes his choice, because once he's gone through with the treatment, worrying won't do him any good.
