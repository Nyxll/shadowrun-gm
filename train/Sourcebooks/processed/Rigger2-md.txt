### INTRODUCTION

If the only thing that comes to mind when you think of a rigger is the "car chick" or even worse the "getaway guy," then this book is for you. For those of you who always wished the rigger character could fulfill its potential as a vital element of the **Shadowrun** team from commanding drones, to taking control of a security-rigged building or even using a vehicle as a weapon to hit stuff that gets in the way (including those pesky pedestrians) well, you've found a home, chummer. **Rigger 2** includes everything you want to know about rigging and riggers in a single volume, from character creation to vehicle creation, from vehicle combat to drone use to rigging a security system.

The rules contained in this volume replace the rigger rules published in **Shadowrun, Second Edition** and the **Rigger Black Book**.

**Rigger 2** begins with **The Rigger**, which talks about the rigger from the perspective of dice pools, skills and concentrations, cyberware/bioware and even Edges and Flaws. This section also covers what it takes to be a rigger, including insights into the mind and emotions of someone jacked into a vehicle.

From there we go straight into **Standard Vehicle Operations**, which covers everything from the basic Driving Test to vehicle statistics and attributes. This section describes what a vehicle can and can't do, and introduces the concept of **Stress**—the idea that a vehicle will wear down if not cared for properly. That's right, we've given the gamemaster even more options for parting a rigger from his hard-earned nuyen.

Now, what good is becoming your vehicle if you can't see what's going on around you? The **Sensors** chapter is devoted entirely to explaining how a rigger uses the sensors of his vehicle to observe and affect his world. This section also includes the basics of **Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)** and **Electronic Deception (ED)**. The chapter on **Special Vehicle Operations** offers rules for operating everything from VTOLs and other airborne vehicles to hovercraft and vehicles with arms, and even pulling and towing vehicles.

Now that your rigger is fully constructed and knows his vehicles inside and out, it's time to test his abilities on the street. The chapter on **Vehicle Combat** provides rules to cover every situation, from auto chases to running down pedestrians. An expanded turn sequence incorporates the rigger's actions into the flow of the standard **Combat Turn**. The rules for magic and vehicles have been expanded and updated, offering the opportunity to include every facet of the awakened world into a single running fight! **Rigger 2** also gives the rigger the tools for the next step: firing her weapons directly from the vehicle. **Vehicle Gunnery** gives target numbers and modifiers for all vehicle-mounted and hand-held weapons, including missile rules. The addition of indirect fire and area-effect rules are custom-designed to ramp up the paranoia level in every city where your team runs the shadows.

But if you think that's all a rigger can handle, you're wrong. The **Drones** chapter describes those special friends of the rigger that allow him to see everything and be everywhere at once. This chapter covers all remote control operations needed to sic these mechanical nightmares on your enemies, and introduces a new element to the world of **Shadowrun** robotics. Riggers interested in working from a more defensive posture can conduct **Electronic Warfare** using a remote control deck to interfere with security operations from a distance, taking advantage of a variety of tactics, from jamming transmissions to taking control of an enemy's drones. Finally, for those riggers who like to fight up close and personal, the **Security Rigger** section fleshes out the rules on rigging a building. These rules cover everything from breaking into a security system to a network combat between two riggers fighting to take control of an entire security system.

The **Advanced Rules** section is for those players and gamemasters who just want more. This chapter offers **Quality Factors** (consider them Edges and Flaws for vehicles; it's the little things you do to get your truck started in winter, the funky way you park the car to keep it from rolling, the glitch in the hatch hydraulics ... ); rules for fuel consumption; advanced gunnery, sensor and electronic warfare rules; and rules for damaging vehicle subsystems.

Perhaps the most-often heard request in **Shadowrun** is for rules that allow a rigger to modify or create his own ride. Well, the wait is over! **Vehicle Design and Customization** offers a complete set of rules to create your own vehicle or modify existing ones, by adding everything from turrets to state-of-the-art armor to super-injected engines to ejector seats. We even answer the burning question of how can a dwarf drive a car? **New Toys** speaks for itself—new toys made with the rigger-mad player character in mind. Missiles, drones, vehicles, mines, cyberware (including the head-implanted remote control deck) and even the first and newest robots on the market.

Finally, the **Vehicle List** provides a complete list of all vehicles ever published in **Shadowrun** products, updated to correspond to the rules in this book.

### THE DEVELOPER'S SAY

In many ways, this book represents a completed first edition more than a second edition. The existing **Shadowrun** rules relegated the rigger to the status of a non-player character; not because his role was insufficiently thought-out, but because the rigger was not given enough rules within the system to spread his wings. Vehicle combat was abstracted so far as to be unusable, and drone combat was barely covered at all. Situations that seem tailor-made for riggers, pre-shadowrun surveillance, drones aiding mercs and mages on a run, riggers taking care of or taking over the security of a target locale—these were tasks that rigger players wanted to perform, but the rules just didn't cover what they needed to do their jobs.

The players were asking for ways to better integrate this character into the shadowrun team, and for more things to do with a rigger character. We chose to not focus this book on vehicles that direction always poses the risk of turning a roleplaying game into a tactical, table-top vehicle-based game. Instead, we wanted to include the rigger in the action of the game, to find a way to incorporate his vehicle actions into the turn along with those characters who were decking, shooting guns and chucking spells.

The result was a vastly expanded rules system. To begin with, the vehicle rules went from a scant six pages in **Shadowrun, Second Edition** to 174 pages in this book. We focused on stripping those six pages of rules down to their core and relaying the foundation, at the same time making sure that the rigger remained integrated into the flow of the game session. Few things are more frustrating than for the game to slow to a crawl as the rigger and gamemaster try to figure out how they should resolve a monstrous hole in the rules (exactly how fast were you going and how much damage should you take from hitting that troll with your Dodge Scoot?).

While the options and actions for driving are fun for the rigger, nothing says **Shadowrun** like doing a lot of damage. We needed rules for using guns, from firing missiles to having a good buddy fire that turret-mounted Ingram Valiant out the back of the minivan. These rules needed to give the player a sense of his rigger's place in the battle, and to cover launching missiles, remote targeting and area-effect damage.

Having fleshed out the rules that existed, we moved on to rules that didn't exist, rules for things the rigger clearly was meant to do, but was never given the necessary information to execute. The primary lack in the rules was for drone use. In my ideal **Shadowrun** world, drones would be used as often as guns, spirits and cyberdecks. Drones and the use of remote control vehicles—one of the coolest parts of being a rigger, in my opinion—were so woefully underdeveloped that the rigger was in danger of dying out from lack of interest. The idea of a shadowrun team using drones as "the sixth man on the team" was left to novelists and players' imaginations, mainly because the rules gave you nothing to work with. My mission for this book was to remedy that missing game application.

As you can see, just putting in the basics and making sure those basics fit into the world of **Shadowrun**, and then making sure the rules appealed to both the casual rigger player and the most serious motorhead took us on a mission to reinvent the wheel, a wheel that can be jacked into, of course. As soon as we were sure that we'd covered all the basics, of course, we had a whole new set of concerns and questions. Those concerns and questions led to sections on sensors, things that mess with sensors, electronic warfare and an expansion of the idea of the security rigger.

Our final goal was to create a vehicle and drone construction system, which was needed to fill the second biggest lack in the existing rules. Aware that a vehicle design system could easily become a micro-management affair of square roots, fractional multipliers and such advanced math that only NASA engineers could figure it out, we chose to create a template system with a single cost multiplier. This system allows players to both modify a "stock" version of any vehicle or drone in the **Shadowrun** universe and to create their own designs using stock parts. This forced us to define the stock types of vehicles, generate options and create the "personal touches" that would make the rigger's toys fit into the world we created for everyone else in the Sixth World—so there are hidden gun ports, turrets, ejector seats, enviro-seals, stealth armor and security devices that range from annoying to deadly.

Our template system also required us to make sure that all existing vehicles worked with that system. We re-evaluated each and every vehicle we had published to date, adjusting the numbers when necessary to bring them into line with the vehicle design system. And just to make it easy for everyone, we compiled a list of all existing vehicles and their stats: everything that a player may wish to have and a gamemaster may want to use can be found at the back of this book.

We rounded out the book with new rigger toys, advanced rules for nearly every aspect of the rigger, record sheets and fiction. And that's how six pages in one book turned into this tome you hold in your hands.

But don't panic yet! The rules presented in this book can be broken down into easily digestible pieces, depending on how much you want to use. Start with the standard vehicle operations and sensors. From there, toss in some vehicle combat and gunnery. That logically takes you to electronic warfare and security riggers. If a rules section seems too advanced, skip it and use it when you are ready. If you never use electronic warfare, that's fine—use what you want and use what you need (but we highly recommend getting drones into your game right away!). **Rigger 2** was created to help you have fun when you play **Shadowrun**, not to get in the way of your enjoyment. If something in this book isn't working for you, skip it and figure it out later. We are confident you will find more in this book that you want to use than not—so jack in, boys and girls, and hit the streets. The only thing that can stop you now is your imagination ... or a fully armored Lone Star Security team!

### THE RIGGER

Neither fish nor fowl, neither decker nor street warrior, the rigger may be the most unique and misunderstood character in the **Shadowrun** universe. This chapter strips the rigger down to the numbers and rebuilds him to illustrate the process of creating a rigger character.

#### CHARACTER CREATION

Either the priority system (p. 47, SRII) or the point-based system (p. 20, **Shadowrun Companion (SRComp)**) can be used to create rigger characters. No racial restrictions apply to rigger characters.

#### SKILLS AND CONCENTRATIONS

Riggers must be proficient in a number of different skills if they want to stay in biz beyond their first runs. For obvious reasons, **Vehicle Skills** are most important for a rigger, but other skills such as **Build and Repair, Gunnery** and **Electronics** will also help a rigger do his job.

**Vehicle Skills and Defaulting**

Nearly every time a rigger character jacks into a vehicle, he will have to perform some feat that requires a Driving Test. Consequently, **Vehicle Skills** are a must for riggers. And because the simsense experience of rigging translates vehicle actions into body maneuvers and sensations, riggers can default between **Vehicle Skills** and **Concentrations** more easily than non-riggers.

Whenever a rigger controlling a vehicle or remote control deck via a **vehicle control rig (VCR)** attempts to default to a **Vehicle Skill** or **Concentration** from another **Vehicle Skill, Vehicle Concentration** or **Reaction Attribute**, each dot crossed adds a +1 modifier instead of the standard +2 modifier. This half-modifier rule applies only when a rigger is jacked in and only when the rigger defaults from **Reaction** or a **Vehicle Skill/Concentration** to another **Vehicle Skill/Concentration**. A rigger cannot use this rule if attempting to default to or from a non-Vehicle Skill (including **Vehicle Build/Repair Skills**).

Characters who do not possess **VCR** cyberware cannot use this half-modifier rule when driving a vehicle using a datajack, even if the vehicle is adapted for rigger operation.

Deacon, a landlubber rigger who possesses the **Car Skill**, finds himself on a run involving a waterborne infiltration of McNeil Island in Puget Sound. Fortunately, Deacon's employer generously "loaned" him a rigged Aztech Nightrunner for the job.

Deacon doesn't have the **Motorboat Skill** needed to operate the Nightrunner, so he must default from his **Car Skill** to the **Motorboat Skill**. On the Revised Skill Web (p. 47, **SRComp**), a default from the Car to the Motorboat Skill crosses four dots, which normally would impose a +8 modifier to any Driving Tests made with the defaulted skill. However, Deacon is a rigger and the boat is equipped with a **VCR**, so the default imposes a +4 modifier to Deacon's Driving Tests.

**Build/Repair Skills**

**Build/Repair Skills** are used for modifying and upgrading vehicles as well as repairing damaged vehicles. In addition to the standard **Vehicle B/R Skills**, characters or their mechanics need the **Electronics** or **Computer B/R Skill** to install or repair certain vehicle components such as drones, electronic countermeasures (**ECM**) and drive-by-wire systems.

If a particular installation or repair task calls for Skill Tests with more than one **B/R Skill**, the character must succeed in all tests to successfully complete the specified task.

If one required **B/R** test succeeds and another fails, the character can repeat the failed test, but the target number increases by +1 for each subsequent test. The test target number does not return to its original value until the player character increases his or her **B/R Skill**.

When reducing the base time required to accomplish a specific task, a player can combine the successes generated on all required tests. However, if any required test produces a result of all "1s," the entire attempt at the task suffers a disastrous failure.

**Gunnery Skill**

The **Gunnery Skill** comes into play any time a rigger uses a vehicle weapon while rigging, whether mounted on the vehicle he's jacked into or on a drone he is controlling via a remote control deck. No matter what the nature of the weapon in question, the **Gunnery Skill** rather than the **Firearms Skill** applies because the mindset of firing a vehicle weapon shares more with the **Gunnery Skill** than with the **Firearms Skill**. The latter focuses primarily on the discipline of the physical body—body positioning, breath control and trigger squeeze—while the former favors mental procedures such as proper sight picture, range estimation and determining maximum effective kill zones.

The **Gunnery Skill** includes a Concentration for Indirect Fire. For information on using this special skill, see **Indirect Fire**, p. 60.

**Computer and Electronics Skills**

Certain concentrations of the **Electronics** and **Computer Skill** are especially useful to riggers. The **Control Systems Concentration** of the **Electronics Skill** applies to actions working with a remote control deck, while the **Electronic Warfare Concentration** is used when conducting electronic warfare.

The **Non-Matrix Programming Specialization** of the **Computer Skill** is used to phrase commands to drones in an ordered, logical manner that a drone's "dog-brain" can understand. The specialization allows the controlling player to add additional dice to a drone's Comprehension Test.

See **Issuing Commands**, page 66, for more information on using these Skills and Concentrations.

**Vehicle Stealth Concentration**

The **Vehicle Stealth Concentration** of the **Stealth Skill** covers the same activities as the standard **Stealth Skill** (sneaking around, tracking, tailing and so on) but applies when a character is driving vehicles. Characters may also further specialize in this Concentration in any of the normal aspects of the **Stealth Skill**.

**Vehicle Tactics Specialization**

The **Vehicle Tactics Specialization** of the **Tactics Concentration** helps characters coordinate the tactics of small groups of vehicles. The Specialization works in conjunction with the new **BattleTac IVIS system**, which enhances the coordination between drones performing a common mission. For more information on the use of this Specialization, see **The BattleTac IVIS System** (p. 67).

### EDGES AND FLAWS

Edges and Flaws (p. 21, **SRComp**) provide additional depth to player characters. Because of the nature of the vehicle control rig (as well as simsense technology in general), certain Edges and Flaws will have different effects on a character jacked into a vehicle. These effects are noted in the following entries.

**Adrenaline Surge**

The **Adrenaline Surge Edge** applies only to physical actions in the physical world. The Edge has no effect on the actions of a character who is jacked into a rigged system or into the Matrix. Additionally, the Edge has no effect on a character who is driving a rigged vehicle using a datajack link.

**Bio-Rejection**

The **Bio-Rejection Flaw** causes a character's body to reject cyberware implants, including the implants required to operate a vehicle control rig. Consequently, riggers cannot take this Flaw.

**Blind and Deaf**

Individual gamemasters and players must determine if the **Blind** and **Deaf** Flaws affect the actions of specific characters jacked into rigs or the Matrix. Simsense works by directly stimulating the vision and hearing centers in the occipital lobe of the brain, so if either of these Flaws is caused by a nerve defect, it may not affect a character who is rigging. However, if the Flaw is caused by a brain disorder, it can make rigging impossible.

If these Flaws do not affect a character's rigging actions, the **Blind Flaw** is worth -2 and the **Deaf Flaw** is worth -1. If the Flaws do affect a character's rigging, both Flaws are worth their full values.

**Night Blindness**

This Flaw does not apply when rigging, because rigged vehicle sensors have image-intensifying capabilities and automatically adjust the brightness level of simsense visual stimuli to match the brain's visual capability.

**Night Vision**

This Edge does not apply when rigging. See the **Night Blindness Flaw**.

**NEW EDGES AND FLAWS**

The following new Edges and Flaws were designed with riggers in mind, but they may be applied to any character archetype, including non-technical characters such as magicians, at the gamemaster's discretion.

**SKILL FLAWS**

Computer Illiterate

Value: -3

A character with the Computer Illiterate flaw has extreme difficulty working with computers and other electronic devices. Such characters have trouble performing such simple tasks as using an unfamiliar telecom, sending e-mail or programming a trideo recorder.

During game play, the character receives a +1 modifier to all tests that involve a computer or some other electronic device in any way, shape or form (for example, a mage with this Flaw would suffer this modifier when attempting to read another mage's electronic hermetic library). Additionally, the gamemaster may require the character to make Success Tests (Target Number 2 or 3) to complete tasks that most people in 2058 take for granted (this can be used to add dramatic tension or comic relief to a game).

Even techno-junkies such as riggers and deckers may have this Flaw, because simsense technology, icon-oriented Matrix programming and the boom of reality filters and sculpted systems have greatly reduced the level of technical know-how needed to rig or deck.

**MENTAL EDGES AND FLAWS**

Sensitive Neural Structure

Value: -2 or -4

Characters with a Sensitive Neural Structure have an especially delicate nervous system and are more vulnerable to neural damage from BTLs, black IC, rigger dump shock and other damaging forms of simsense. Whenever a character with this Flaw must resist these types of damage, reduce the character's effective Willpower Rating by 1 for a -2 Flaw, and by 2 for a -4 Flaw. Willpower may not be reduced below 1 this way.

Simsense Vertigo

Value: -2

Characters who suffer from Simsense Vertigo experience feelings of disorientation when they use cyberdecks, vehicle control rigs, entertainment simrigs, smartlinks, display links or any other simsense technology. Such characters receive an additional +1 modifier to all target numbers and a -1 modifier to Initiative when operating any simsense-related device.

Spike Resistance

Value: 2 or 4

Characters with the Spike Resistance Edge have increased resistance to high simsense spikes and harmful forms of ASIST, such as black IC or rigger dump shock. When such characters resist these types of simsense-related damage, increase the character's effective Willpower by 1 for every 2 points of Spike Resistance the character possesses.

**OTHER EDGES AND FLAWS**

Gremlins

Value: -1, -2, -3 or -4

Any equipment touched by a character with the Gremlins Flaw immediately displays an odd tendency to malfunction. Any time such a character handles a piece of equipment, roll 2D6. On a result of 2, the equipment breaks down. The severity of the failure depends on the value of the Flaw.

On a 1-point Flaw, affected equipment operates with a +1 or -1 modifier, whichever works against the character. The modifiers apply to both Success Tests and effect-value ratings (such as a weapon's Power, a sensor's Flux Rating, a cyberdeck's MPCP and so on). To make such equipment work, the character must expend a Simple Action to bang the device against a hard surface. The equipment will function normally during the character's next Combat Phase.

On a 2-point Flaw, affected equipment simply does not work. Again, a sharp jolt (and a Simple Action expended by the character) will bring the unit back on-line in the character's next Combat Turn.

On a 3-point Flaw, the equipment suffers a major malfunction and operates with a +2 or -2 modifier (again, whichever is detrimental to the character). The modifier applies to Success Tests and effect-value ratings. Such equipment must be repaired before it will work again. To find the cost of such repairs, multiply the equipment's cost by .2 and add the result to the repairman's labor charges, if applicable (see **The Mechanic Contact**, p. 19).

On a 4-point Flaw, the equipment breaks down and ceases to work. Only a major overhaul (and some raised eyebrows from the local repairman) will get the unit functioning again. To find the cost of this repair, multiply the equipment's cost by .5. Add labor charges to the result, if applicable.

If a character with the **Gremlins Flaw** is driving a vehicle, one of the vehicle's major subsystems (steering, brakes, sensors and so on) or special modifications or features (customized engines, vehicle weapons, special accessories and the like) may be affected. The gamemaster can roll for each separate item or simply roll once and choose the system that goes down.

The **Gremlins Flaw** has no effect on cyberware, bioware or magical equipment such as ritual materials, foci and fetishes. However, the Flaw may affect hermetic libraries on electronic media, resulting in lost files, unrecoverable memory errors, short circuits or even an electrical fire.

Vehicle Empathy

Value: 2

Characters with this Edge seem to understand vehicles better than most people and can coax improved performance from vehicles simply by being in physical contact with them. Whenever such a character is in physical contact with a machine (either through manual controls or jacked into the vehicle), reduce the Handling of the vehicle by 1.

---

### DICE POOLS

**Dice Pools** enable player characters to use extra dice during **Skill Tests**. Each specific Dice Pool rating determines how many dice are available in a character's Dice Pools, but the number of Dice Pool dice added to a particular test may never exceed the character's rating in the test's skill. All Dice Pools refresh at the beginning of each Combat Turn.

A number of different pools—specifically, the **Control Pool, Combat Pool** and the **Task Pool**—come into play when a rigger is jacked into a machine. The new **IVIS Pool** applies when using drones equipped with the **IVIS system**.

The following rules for these **Dice Pools** replace the Dice Pool rules presented on pages 84-85 of **SRII**.

CONTROL POOL

The Control Pool is equal to the rigger's Reaction, plus any enhancements gained from the vehicle control rig (VCR) cyberware. Any indirect modifiers from cerebral boosters and encephalons apply as well.

Control Pool dice may be added to any test that deals strictly with the control of a vehicle. They may be used on **Maneuver Tests** and tests made to resist damage from attacks against a character's vehicle, but they may not be used for tests made when firing vehicle weapons or using vehicle sensors.

COMBAT POOL

The rigger may add dice from the Combat Pool to any Gunnery Tests made for firing vehicle weapons using a rig. However, the number of Combat Pool dice cannot exceed the character's Gunnery Rating. If the character is using a Concentration or Specialization, the Combat Pool dice may not exceed the Concentration or Specialization Level.

TASK POOL

The Task Pool is available to any character who possesses an encephalon or a cerebral booster (pp. 49, 23, Shadowtech). Task Pool dice may be applied to Technical, Knowledge and Build/Repair Skill tests.

The **Task Pool** is important to riggers because players can add **Task Pool** dice to **Electronics Tests**, which come into play in remote control, sensor and electronic warfare operations. (See **Electronic Warfare**, p. 69, for more information on the use of the **Electronics Skill** and its Concentrations in rigger operations.)

IVIS POOL

The IVIS Pool is available to riggers controlling drones equipped with the BattleTac IVIS system. When using the IVIS system, the rigger may use IVIS Pool dice to augment tests made when his drones are performing group tasks. For more information, see The BattleTac IVIS System, page 67.

---

### THE VEHICLE CONTROL RIG

**Vehicle control rig (VCR)** cyberware sets the rigger apart from all other **Shadowrun** characters. Without this piece of cyberware, the rigger is just another combat-oriented character who can drive a car. The **VCR** translates the rigger's neural impulses into various vehicle operations—stop, accelerate, turn left, fire turret gun, perform sensor sweep and so on—so that the vehicle responds almost instantaneously to the rigger's mental command.

A vehicle control rig gives the rigger a **Control Pool**, as well as conferring **Reaction** and **Initiative** bonuses for vehicle and drone combat. Reaction and Initiative bonuses normally provided by other factors do not apply; the **VCR** is the only source of such bonuses for the rigger engaged in vehicle and drone combat.

**RIGGING VERSUS DECKING**

Rigging and decking both use simsense virtual simulation technology, and riggers and deckers both rely on pure brainpower to do the job. However, that is where the similarities between the two end.

When decking the Matrix, a character uses the higher intelligence centers of his brain. In contrast, rigging a vehicle is much more reflexive and instinctive—much like playing an arcade game—and most of the required mental activity takes place in the rigger's lower brain. Consequently, deckers cannot interact with a vehicle control rig, as they lack the proper hardware to interface with a vehicle control rig's **ASIST** protocols. Deckers and other characters without **VCR** implants can jack into a rigged vehicle if it has a datajack link and drive it normally, but they gain no bonuses other than the +1 to Reaction associated with a standard datajack connection (see **Datajack Port**, p. 124).

Deckers and other non-riggers with datajacks may also interact with rigged remote control decks in the "captain's chair" mode (see **Operative Modes**, p. 65), but they cannot interface directly with, or "jump into," a drone (see p. 65). Likewise, deckers cannot use Response Increase hardware to improve their Reaction or Initiative. Non-riggers cannot interface with a **CCSS** security system, while deckers can do so only with a special accessory and severely degraded performance (see **Decking a Rigged System**, p. 80).

Conversely, riggers tend to be sloppy deckers, as their enhanced thalami encourage knee-jerk reactions rather than the intense cerebral concentration necessary for surfing the Matrix. To reflect this, rigger characters suffer a +1 modifier to all target numbers when decking in the Matrix. Additionally, reduce the rigger's **Hacking Pool** by the level of his **VCR**.

The Jackson Street Posse suffers a major loss when its decker is geeked in a gang ambush after leaving a meet with a Mr. Johnson. So when the team needs some information from the Matrix for its next run, it turns to its resident rigger, Otto Matick, because he's the only remaining team member with a datajack. Otto jacks into the decker's Fuchi-6 and dives into the net.

Otto has an Intelligence of 4, which, combined with the Fuchi-6's MPCP Rating of 8, would normally give him a Hacking Pool of 4 [(4 + 8) + 3, using the Hacking Pool formula on p. 18 of **Virtual Realities 2.0**]. However, Otto's Level 2 **VCR** reduces his Hacking Pool to 2.

A rigger can get around the **Hacking Pool** handicap in two ways. First, the rigger can install a second datajack that bypasses his **VCR** cyberware and connects directly to his cerebral cortex. Alternatively, the rigger may install a **VCR** with a reflex trigger, which enables him to turn his **VCR** on or off with a Simple Action. However, a reflex trigger increases the cost of a **VCR** by an additional 13,000 nuyen and +0.2 Essence. Additionally, reflex triggers cannot be retrofitted to **VCRs**; a rigger must replace his entire **VCR** with new cyberware containing the trigger.

---

### RIGGING AND OTHER CYBERWARE

Because of the way **VCRs** interact with the brain, certain types of cyberware don't have the same effects during rigging as they do during normal physical actions, as described below.

Intelligence Enhancers

Cyberware that enhances Intelligence increases Reaction indirectly as a result of the improved Intelligence attribute. The only implants published to date that meet these criteria are the cerebral booster and encephalon (pp. 23, 49, Shadowtech). Furthermore, the unique nature of the encephalon enables riggers to use Driving skillsofts without the need for skillwires for the purposes of rigging. Characters without encephalons cannot use the skillsofts without skillwires.

Reflex Recorder Bioware

The reflex recorder bioware implant normally enhances a character's Active Skills (including Vehicle Skills). The enhancement improves the functioning of nerve pair clusters around the spinal cord, but these nerve clusters are not used when a rigger is jacked into the vehicle. Therefore, reflex recorder bioware has no effect on Driving Skill when a character is controlling a vehicle using a VCR.

Datajacks

The improved datajacks in the Shadowtech sourcebook (p. 45) increase the rate of information flow between flesh and machine. Thus, an improved datajack (Level 2 and higher) adds a bonus to Perception Tests while rigging. For every level above Level 1, an improved datajack adds one additional die to Perception Tests (for example, a Level 2 datajack adds 1 extra die, a Level 3 jack adds 2 dice and so on).

Because of the way the **VCR** interacts with the brain, riggers have their datajacks installed behind and below their ears, next to the submandibular glands, instead of at the temples as do deckers. Characters who wish to be both deckers and riggers without suffering the penalties described in **Rigging versus Decking**, p. 16, must have both a decker datajack and a rigger datajack.

Move-by-Wire Systems

The move-by-wire system (p. 39, Cybertechnology) works by inducing a continual state of quasi-epileptic seizure in a character. A computer in the system channels the seizure into motion whenever the brain tells the body to move. Consequently, the move-by-wire system works in direct opposition to a VCR.

Each level of move-by-wire reduces the effective level of a **VCR** by 1 (i.e. -2 to Reaction and -1D6 to Initiative) and lowers a character's **Control Pool** by 1. If a rigger's move-by-wire rating is equal to or higher than his **VCR** rating, he receives no bonuses to Reaction and Initiative while rigging, but he still benefits from the **Control Pool** (assuming that the move-by-wire system has not negated it).

Monkeywrench has a Level 3 **VCR** (+6 Reaction, +3D6 Initiative) and a Control Pool of 10. If Monkeywrench received a Level 1 move-by-wire system, it would reduce his rig enhancement to +4 Reaction and +2D6 Initiative and would reduce her Control Pool to 9. A Level 3 move-by-wire system would completely negate any bonuses to Reaction and Initiative and leave Monkeywrench with a Control Pool of 7 dice. A Level 4 move-by-wire would have no additional effect on Monkey's Reaction or Initiative, but would reduce his Control Pool to 6.

---

### RIGGING AND CYBERMANCY

Cybermancy allows a character to possess more cyberware than his Essence Attribute would normally permit. (For basic rules governing cyberware and Essence, see p. 43, **SRII**. For basic cybermancy rules, see p. 78, **Cybertechnology**.)

Most riggers shouldn't need to take enough cyberware to make cybermancy necessary, unless they want to improve their performance outside of vehicles. Riggers who choose cybermancy may experience a dangerous side effect during rigging—increased susceptibility to "getting lost in the details" (p. 82, **Cybertechnology**).

Because riggers trade the neural sensations of their body for that of a machine, they are likely to get lost within their machines while rigging and forget that they are human. Consequently, a rigger's invoked memory stimulator, or **IMS**, will kick in far more frequently than that of a non-rigger cyberzombie.

Rigger-zombies get lost in the details whenever all roll results are successes on a Perception Test with a modified Target Number of 4 or more (instead of 5 or more). In addition, the **IMS** kicks in after the player fails only two consecutive Willpower Tests to escape this condition, rather than five consecutive failures.

### MAINTENANCE AND OVERHEAD

Equipment is like contacts; if you don't take care of it, it won't take care of you. Even under normal operation, vehicles require periodic maintenance checks to stay running. Considering the extreme pedal-to-the-metal paces that riggers put their vehicles through, maintenance becomes especially important.

Note that the following maintenance rules are NOT the same as the **SOTA** rules presented in the **Shadowrun Companion** (pp. 85-87). **SOTA** reflects the relative obsolescence of a machine compared to the technology curve. The maintenance rules below reflect real degradation caused by normal use.

Under the basic **Shadowrun** rules, maintenance-related issues such as fuel, storage and scheduled services are covered by a character's Lifestyle costs. However, under the Lifestyle descriptions in **SRII** (p. 189), most characters don't own or operate a vehicle unless they maintain a **Middle** or higher Lifestyle. Furthermore, the Lifestyle rules may not adequately reflect the large numbers of sophisticated and modified drones and vehicles that riggers may possess.

The overhead cost of a vehicle includes costs for routine maintenance, fuel consumption and storage. To determine a vehicle's monthly overhead, first calculate the vehicle's cost value. The cost value is equal to the vehicle's base nuyen value plus the value of all of its accessories and modifications. (The base nuyen value is the amount listed in the appropriate sourcebook, not the final price the character paid for the vehicle, which is altered by Availability and Street Index.) The costs for all vehicles previously published in various **Shadowrun** sourcebooks appear in the **Vehicle List**, beginning on page 148.

Next, calculate the total number of **Stress Points** (see **Standard Vehicle Operations**, p. 25) that the vehicle has accumulated over the past month of game time. Individual gamemasters determine when vehicles incur Stress in their games.

The monthly overhead cost for a vehicle is equal to 1 percent of the vehicle's cost value (the cost value divided by 100), rounded up, plus ten times the Stress Points accumulated over the past month.

`Cost Value / 100 + (Stress Points of past month x 10) = Monthly Overhead`

If desired, characters may pay for some or all overhead costs with **Good Karma** instead of nuyen. This Karma expenditure reflects the time and effort spent between adventures keeping the vehicle up to snuff. In this case, each point of **Good Karma** covers 500 nuyen of overhead costs.

Josie Cruise owns four vehicles: a rigged and heavily modified Hughes Stallion, a rigged and modified Leyland-Rover van, an unmodified Eurocar Westwind 2000, and an off-the-shelf Aztechnology GCR-23C Crawler drone. During a month when those vehicles incur no Stress Points, their overhead cost would be calculated as follows:

|Vehicle|Cost Value|1 percent of Cost Value|
|---|---|---|
|Modified Hughes Stallion|500,000|5,000|
|Modified Leyland-Rover van|40,000|400|
|Eurocar Westwind 2000|100,000|1,000|
|Aztechnology GCR-23C Crawler|1,250|13|
|Total Overhead Cost||6,413¥|

Josie believes that any decent rigger should take good care of the vehicles he uses, so she spends a considerable amount of time between runs keeping her vehicles at prime operational readiness. Josie's player spends 4 points of **Good Karma** on vehicle maintenance this month, which reduces the overhead cost by 2,000 (4 x 500). That leaves her with a final overhead cost of 4,413 nuyen.

---

### LIFESTYLE REDUCTIONS

Riggers who maintain a **Middle** or higher Lifestyle receive a discount to overhead costs, because part of these Lifestyle levels includes owning and maintaining a vehicle. **Middle Lifestyle** reduces total monthly overhead costs by 200 nuyen. **High Lifestyle** reduces total monthly overhead costs by 1,500 nuyen, and a **Luxury Lifestyle** reduces total monthly overhead costs by 3,000 nuyen. Characters may distribute Lifestyle discounts among their different vehicles as they see fit.

Josie Cruise normally lives a **Middle Lifestyle**. Because **Middle Lifestyle** grants a 200-nuyen credit to overhead costs, her monthly overhead drops from 6,413 to 6,213 nuyen before applying any Karma.

After a successful run retrieving a rare tropical flower from the jungles of Amazonia, Josie's bonus allows her to boost her Lifestyle to **Luxury** level for six months. During those six months, Josie receives a 3,000-nuyen discount to her overhead costs, so her monthly overhead falls to 3,413 nuyen before spending Karma.

Neglecting Overhead

If a character neglects to pay his monthly overhead upkeep costs, wear and tear degrades his vehicles. For every month the overhead cost of a vehicle is not paid, the vehicle accumulates 1 Stress Point.

However, a character can restore **Stress Points** lost in this manner during subsequent months. To do so, the character must pay the overhead cost for the missed month in addition to the cost for the current month, spend 1 point of **Good Karma** and make a successful **Vehicle Build/Repair (4) Test**. Success restores 1 **Stress Point** lost due to unpaid overhead.

After an unresolved misunderstanding with the UCAS Air Force over Seattle airspace, Josie Cruise is forced to hide out for a month in the Council Lands while the heat blows over. Because she left her Eurocar Westwind in storage in a Tacoma long-term garage, she is forced to skip maintenance on the sports car. As a result, the Westwind gains 1 **Stress Point** by the end of the time period.

When Josie gets back to the Seattle metroplex, she will have to spend an extra 1,000 nuyen in overhead costs and 1 point of **Good Karma** to make up for the missed overhead. Additionally, she must make a **Car B/R (4) Test** before she can remove 1 point from the car's **Stress Rating**.

### THE MECHANIC CONTACT

A mechanic is a special contact of particular importance to rigger characters. Most shadowrunners use their contacts for two purposes: obtaining information and getting equipment. Riggers use their mechanic contacts for these two purposes, and also rely on them to repair their vehicles and machines and install vehicle modifications.

In **Repairing Vehicles** (p. 26) and **Vehicle Customization** (p. 118), the costs listed for repairing or modifying vehicles are always preceded by the term "**Parts Cost**," because these costs cover the purchase of required parts only. Characters must install those parts themselves or find someone else to do so. Thus, riggers turn to shadow mechanics, unless the rigger has the wide assortment of **Build/Repair Skills** needed to do the job.

If a rigger asks a mechanic to fix or modify her vehicle, the mechanic is going to charge her for labor. Hey, mechanics are people too, and they need nuyen to buy food, pay rent, connect to the Matrix and so on.

The going rate for shadow mechanics is 100 nuyen per work hour (modified by the Lifestyle percentage, if playing a campaign in a city other than Seattle). If this rate sounds somewhat high, keep in mind that the mechanic is doing extra service in consideration for his client of dubious legal standing (like not registering vehicle weapons, forgetting to log in work hours with the garage management, forging names and SINs for requisition orders and so on). Mechanics will work eight hours a day, five days a week. Any overtime beyond that is charged at time and a half or more.

Also keep in mind that this rate is for Level 1 contacts and **Friends of a Friend**, to whom the character must also pay the initial contact fee, as well as labor charges. (See pp. 62-65, **SRComp**, for more information on Contact Levels and Friends of Friends.)

Higher-level contacts will offer their services at reduced rates.

A Level 2 mechanic contact will charge the market labor rate (50 nuyen an hour) and waive the overtime surcharge, provided that the job doesn't impact too much on his free time (for example, don't ask him to give up his Friday nights or to wake up early on Saturday or Sunday morning).

A Level 3 mechanic will not only waive overtime, he'll also charge his buddy a discounted rate (25 nuyen an hour). Additionally, if the character has been really good to the mechanic (above and beyond the call of Level 3 contact upkeep) and the vehicle work will take only a day or two, the mechanic will do the job for free. (Gamemasters should grant this favor only if rigger players have been good with their roleplaying.)

### STANDARD VEHICLE OPERATIONS

This section provides rules for all non-combat vehicle operations. (All you newbies out there should note that drones are considered vehicles, so the following rules also apply to directly and remotely controlled drones performing non-combat operations.) All rules provided in this chapter supersede previous vehicle rules published in **Shadowrun, Second Edition** and the **Rigger Black Book**.

**THE DRIVING TEST**

For convenience, simply assume that characters can automatically accomplish basic vehicle maneuvers, such as driving to the local Stuffer Shack or taking the old helicopter for a little sightseeing hop. Any time a character attempts a difficult maneuver, however—such as negotiating a hairpin turn at 100 kph or jumping a Yamaha Rapier over four lanes of rush-hour traffic—the character must make a **Driving Test** to determine whether he successfully accomplishes the task.

The **Driving Test** is a Complex Action. (See **Vehicle Combat**, p. 45 for rules on actions that riggers can take during a Combat Turn.)

To make a **Driving Test**, the player character uses his most appropriate **Vehicle Skill**. In addition, the player can add a number of dice equal to the vehicle's **Autonav Rating** (every autonav system contains collision-avoidance and defensive-driving programs). If the vehicle is rigged, the character also can add a number of **Control Pool** dice equal to the character's skill rating.

The base target number for the test is the vehicle's **Handling Rating**. Modify the base target number with all appropriate modifiers from the **Driving Test Modifiers Table** to determine the final target number.

**DRIVING TEST MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**Unfamiliar vehicle**: If a character is operating a type of vehicle that he does not regularly operate, the unfamiliar vehicle modifier applies. The gamemaster determines whether a character is unfamiliar with a particular vehicle type.

**Large/very large vehicle of type**: If a character is operating a vehicle that is heavier or larger than the average vehicle of its type, the large/very large vehicle modifier applies. For example, the large-vehicle modifier would apply if a character is using the **Car Skill** for a **Driving Test** when driving a van. If the character were using the **Car Skill** to operate a truck, the very-large-vehicle modifier would apply. The gamemaster determines which modifier applies.

**Weather conditions**: Rain, snow, heavy winds and other common adverse weather results in **Bad** conditions. Hurricanes, blizzards, thunderstorms (for aircraft) and other severe weather (including storms caused by nature spirits) result in **Terrible** conditions.

**Terrain**: The terrain modifier reflects the type of terrain in which the character is operating the vehicle, according to the following terrain definitions. **Open** terrain refers to flat areas without buildings, trees, or other significant features; this type of terrain includes highways. Open terrain for aircraft is cloudless skies, and for boats, smooth water. **Normal** terrain refers to typical countryside and winding roads that offer only a few obstacles. Normal terrain for aircraft is partly cloudy skies, and for boats, light seas. **Restricted** terrain refers to suburban streets, light, winding, hilly areas and so on. Fog, rain or total darkness can change Normal terrain to Restricted. Restricted terrain for aircraft is overcast skies and rain, and for boats, high seas. **Tight** terrain refers to urban mazes, badlands and dense woods. Mist, glare or low light changes Restricted terrain to Tight, and smoke, heavy fog or total darkness change Normal terrain to Tight. Tight terrain for aircraft and boats is high winds.

See page 35 for definitions of terrain for air-cushion vehicles (hovercraft).

**Actions performed during combat**: This modifier applies if the character is performing a standard vehicle action (such as landing an aircraft, stopping a car at a certain location and so on) under gunfire or in a combat situation. Note that a successful **Driving Test** does not guarantee that the vehicle evades weapons fire while performing the action. In addition, **Control Pool** dice allocated for the **Driving Test** cannot be used for resisting damage and vice versa.

This modifier does not apply if the vehicle is performing vehicle combat actions (see p. 45).

**Non-rigger driving using a datajack**: This modifier applies if the character is driving using a datajack but does not have vehicle control rig cyberware. Likewise, the modifier applies if a rigger is driving a vehicle not adapted for rigger control. **Control Pool** dice are not available if the vehicle is not rigged.

**Rigger in control**: The rigger-in-control modifier applies if the character has **VCR** cyberware and the vehicle is adapted for rigger control. In this case, reduce the target number by an amount equal to twice the **VCR** Rating.


Whiz Kid is a rigger and has a Rating 1 vehicle control rig. He's also into aircraft, helos to be exact, and he's got a Rotor Skill of 4 and a Fixed-Rotor Concentration of 6. That means he can operate any fixed-rotor aircraft—whether jacked in, via remote or by manual control—at a skill rating of 6.

When Whiz Kid's Ares Dragon helicopter (Handling 5, Autonav 2) hits a sudden squall, he decides to land before the weather gets worse. Based on the conditions, the gamemaster decides that Whiz Kid needs to make a **Driving Test** to land the chopper.

The target number for the test would be calculated as follows:

- **Base Target Number = vehicle's Handling Rating:** 5
- **Unfamiliar vehicle** (Whiz has never flown a Dragon before): +1
- **Non-stressful situation** (trying to land): -1
- **Large vehicle** (the Ares Dragon is big): +2
- **Bad conditions** (the squall): +2
- **Rigger in control** (VCR Rating 1): -2
- **Final Target Number:** 8

Whiz Kid uses 8 dice for the test (6 for his **Fixed-Rotor Concentration** and 2 from his **Autonav Rating**) but decides not to add any **Control Pool** dice, because he's saving those for picking up his teammates from a combat zone once the squall blows over.

The **Driving Test** produces the following results: 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6 and 6. Re-rolling the three sixes, he gets a 1, 1 and 4, for a final result of 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7 and 10. The last die saves his butt, because it gives him one success. Whiz Kid puts the Dragon down safely.

### VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES

The following definitions of the **Shadowrun** vehicle attributes replace the previously published definitions (p. 104, SRII). Note that not all attributes apply to all vehicle types; those attributes that apply only to certain vehicle types are noted as such in the description.

Unless otherwise noted, all the rules mentioned in these descriptions apply to both rigger and non-rigger characters. For a complete list of vehicles, see the **Vehicles List**, p. 148.

**HANDLING**
Handling refers to the maneuverability of a vehicle and how easily a character can control it. The higher the rating, the more difficult a vehicle is to control. The **Handling Rating** functions as the base target number for all **Driving Tests** that use a **Vehicle Skill**. Most ground vehicles have two separate Handling Ratings: the first represents the vehicle's Handling Rating on a road, while the second represents its Handling in off-road terrain.

Whenever ground vehicles are traveling across anything other than a paved surface, they are considered to be traveling in off-road terrain. Off-road terrain is a subcategory of the standard terrain types (**Open, Normal, Restricted** and **Tight**).

Any ground vehicle moving in off-road terrain reduces its **Speed Rating** by half, unless the vehicle possesses off-road suspension (see **Vehicle Design**, p. 125).

**SPEED**
The **Speed Rating** represents the maximum safe Speed at which a vehicle can travel for a sustained distance. This speed is expressed as meters per Combat Turn.

Fixed-wing aircraft have two **Speed Ratings**. The lower rating represents the aircraft's stall speed, the minimum speed the aircraft must maintain to keep flying.

To convert a vehicle's **Speed Rating** from meters/Combat Turn into kilometers per hour, multiply the rating by 1.2. To convert a **Speed Rating** to miles per hour, multiply the rating by 0.75.

**Exceeding the Speed Rating**
Vehicles may exceed their **Speed Ratings** by up to 1.5 times the rating, but doing so creates extra wear and tear on the vehicle that can increase the chance of spontaneous system failures. (See **Stress**, p. 25, for more information.)

**ACCELERATION**
The **Acceleration Rating** measures how quickly a vehicle can increase its speed within a given period. This attribute is used when vehicles are fleeing from or pursuing other vehicles during vehicle combat. In such cases, a character can make a **Driving Test** to boost his Speed. Each success generated on the test increases the vehicle's Speed by its **Acceleration Rating**.

Chazz the Spazz is flying along on his BMW Blitzen 2050 trying to escape from some Lone Star goons chasing him. He's going along at 50 mpt (meters per turn), but the goons are getting closer so he decides to accelerate (the Blitzen has an **Acceleration Rating** of 14). Chazz generates 2 successes on his **Driving Test**, which provides him with a **Speed Rating** increase of 28. That means the Blitzen accelerates from 50 mpt to 78 mpt as it enters the next Combat Phase.

**Decelerating**
According to the way things work in the real world, objects take a certain amount of time to stop moving, based on their speed and mass. A vehicle can brake or otherwise decelerate safely as long as the vehicle's deceleration within a single Combat Turn does not exceed its **Acceleration Rating** multiplied by 4.

If the vehicle's rate of deceleration exceeds this limit, the controlling character must make a **Body Resistance Test**. The base target number for the test is 3. For every 20 meters per turn (or portion thereof) by which the vehicle exceeds the safe deceleration limit, increase the target number by 1.

For every two dice results that do not exceed the target number, increase the vehicle's Stress by 1. On a roll of all 1s, the driver loses control in a skid and must make a **Crash Test** (see p. 51).

For more information on **Body Resistance Tests**, see **Vehicle Damage**, p. 49.

Chazz the Spazz is whizzing along at 78 mpt when the gamemaster tells him that the bridge directly ahead of him is out. Chazz slams on the brakes. The Blitzen has a safe deceleration limit of 56 mpt (**Acceleration Rating** 14 multiplied by 4), so if he stays within that limit the Blitzen will still be traveling at 22 mpt when it hits the space where the bridge used to be. A fall from the bridge would hurt much more than any damage that some hard braking will do to the bike, so Chazz decides to decelerate to 0 mpt. That requires a **Body Resistance Test**, which Chazz makes against a Target Number of 5 (base Target Number 3 plus 2 because the Blitzen is traveling 22 mpt above its safe deceleration limit).

**BODY**
A vehicle's **Body Rating** represents its mass and measures how much punishment it can take, whether from weapons fire or just plain hard driving. The **Body Ratings Table** lists Body Ratings for vehicles of various types and weights. For rules on using the Body Rating in game play, see **Vehicle Damage**, page 49.

**Body Rating and Weapon Mounts**
A vehicle's **Body Rating** also indicates how many weapons can be mounted on the vehicle. Every hardpoint mount installed on the vehicle takes up 2 **Body Rating** points. Every firmpoint installed on the vehicle takes up 1 point.

For example, a vehicle with a **Body Rating 3** can have a single hardpoint mount and a single firmpoint mount or it can have three firmpoints. For more information on weapon mounts, see **Vehicle Weapon Mounts**, page 131.

### BODY RATINGS TABLE

The table you provided was garbled. I've found and formatted the corrected version below.

### VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES (CONTINUED)

**Damage Reduction**
The very nature of a vehicle reduces the damage level of all weapons attacks by one level (except for those weapons firing munitions specifically designated as anti-vehicle munitions). For example, an attack from an Ares Predator (Moderate damage) would be reduced to Light damage. This means weapons that inflict only Light damage cannot affect vehicles. For more information, see **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**, p. 53.

**ARMOR**
Armor is the rating for a complete composite armor that provides protection to the vehicle against all weapons fire (see **Vehicle Combat**, p. 53).

Vehicle armor works in two distinct ways. First, the **Armor Rating** functions as the Barrier Rating of the vehicle. This means that the armor of a vehicle can absorb an amount of damage from a weapon's unmodified Power equal to the **Armor Rating**. For example, if a vehicle has an **Armor Rating** of 6, no weapon with a Power Rating of 6 or lower could penetrate it; firing at the vehicle with a Uzi III (6M damage) gets you a bunch of sparks for your effort and no actual effect.

Against fire from a weapon with a Power Rating that exceeds the armor's rating, the armor acts like standard ballistic or impact armor and reduces the Power of the attack. For example, armor with a rating of 6 will reduce the Power of fire from an Ares Predator (9M) to 3M.

Vehicle armor provides no protection against impact damage from collisions. (See the explanation of **Body** in **Vehicle Damage**, p. 49.)

**SIGNATURE**
Signature indicates a vehicle's vulnerability to electromagnetic or thermal detection and serves as the target number for sensor and missile to-hit tests made against the vehicle.

Signature, however, does not represent the vehicle's vulnerability to target designators, such as laser and microwave targeting devices (see p. 60, **Fields of Fire**). Characters use standard ranged combat rules when targeting vehicles with such devices.

**AUTONAV**
The **Autonav Rating** represents the vehicle's collision-detection and navigation system. This rating replaces the **Autopilot Rating**.

During game play, a vehicle's **Autonav Rating** provides extra dice a character can add to **Driving Tests** made while performing only non-combat maneuvers. A vehicle's autonav system actually impedes the controlling character's ability to perform combat maneuvers. (See **Vehicle Actions**, p. 45.)

Note that the autonav system merely serves as a driver's assistant. It can make minor control adjustments to avoid collisions and navigate a course, but it cannot perform any other autonomous control functions.

**PILOT**
The **Pilot Rating** indicates a drone or robot's autonomous decision-making capability (more commonly known as the "dog brain"). Drones with high **Pilot Ratings** can "understand" and execute more complex commands than those with lower ratings.

A drone's **Pilot Rating** applies when no rigger is controlling the drone. In such circumstances, the drone's **Pilot Rating** is substituted for the rigger's relevant skill for any required test.

For more information, see **Issuing Commands**, p. 66 in **Drones**.

**SENSOR**
A vehicle's **Sensor Rating** determines the base number of dice used in the vehicle's **Perception Tests**. The **Sensor Rating** may also add dice to **Gunnery Tests** for attacks with certain types of vehicle weapons (see **Sensor Enhanced Gunnery**, p. 58).

The **Sensor Rating** represents the vehicle's target-detection (knowing a target exists), target-identification (knowing what the target is), and targeting systems (locking weapons on to a target), as well as the vehicle's radio transponders for position-locating systems such as GPS or ALI.

If a vehicle has an autonavigation system (an **Autonav Rating**), it automatically has a **Sensor Rating** of 0 or higher. Currently, no **Shadowrun** vehicles without autonav are equipped with sensor systems, so a vehicle without autonav has no **Sensor Rating**.

**CARGO FACTOR**
A vehicle's **Cargo Factor (CF)** indicates how much space is available in the vehicle for cargo such as baggage, vehicle modifications or other material.

One point of **CF** is equivalent to a cube of space one half meter long on each side (0.125 cubic meters).

A vehicle's **CF** limits the types and ratings of certain modifications (such as vehicle armor and weapons) that can be added to the vehicle. See **Weight and Space Restrictions**, p. 118, for more information.

**LOAD**
**Load** represents the amount of cargo weight a vehicle can lift, pull or carry. Load does not include passengers, except for in unusual circumstances (such as sasquatches or the troll-variant giants described on page 41 of the **Shadowrun Companion**).

A vehicle's **Load** limits the types and ratings of certain vehicle modifications (such as vehicle armor and weapons) that can be added to a vehicle. See **Weight and Space Restrictions**, p. 118, for more information.

**SEATING**
The **Seating** code denotes the seating capacity of a vehicle. The order of numerals in the Seating code indicates the arrangement of seats in the vehicle. For example, a Seating code of "2 bucket + 2 bucket + 2 bench" indicates that the front of the vehicle contains two bucket seats, the middle contains two bucket seats and the back of the vehicle contains two bench seats.

**ENTRY POINTS**
Similarly, the **Entry points** code of a vehicle indicates the number and arrangement of entry/exit points in the standard model of the vehicle. An **Entry point** code of "2 + 1" indicates two access points in the front or top of the vehicle and one access point in the rear or bottom of the vehicle.

**FUEL**
A vehicle's **Fuel** code describes the type of fuel the vehicle uses and the size of its fuel tank. A two-part Fuel code that lists two fuel types and two tank capacities indicates that a vehicle uses two different fuel sources. In such cases, the first fuel type listed is the vehicle's primary fuel.

For information on **Fuel** rules, see **Vehicle Design and Customization**, page 112.

**SET-UP/BREAKDOWN TIME**
**Set-Up/Breakdown Time** is the time needed to configure a drone for operation and break the drone down for storage. One Combat Turn must be spent activating a drone after it has been configured, regardless of the drone's **Setup/Breakdown Time**.

**LANDING/TAKEOFF (L/T) PROFILE**
A fixed-wing aircraft's **Landing/Takeoff Profile** describes the minimum runway distance the aircraft needs to take off and land. Landing/Takoff Profiles are divided into four categories: **Normal, STOL** (Short Takeoff/Landing), **VSTOL** (Very Short Takeoff/Landing), and **VTOL** (Vertical Takeoff/Landing). See **Aircraft**, page 36, for more information.

**ECONOMY**
Economy indicates how far a vehicle can travel on a given amount of fuel. Drones have a subrating under the **Economy** heading, called **Idle Economy**. This rating reflects how much fuel a drone consumes during a given period while idling in position.

For more information on **Economy**, see **Variable Fuel Consumption**, p. 81.

### SPECIAL VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES

The following vehicle characteristics apply to vehicle operations, but do not appear in the standard vehicle statistic profiles.

**ED/ECD**
A vehicle's **electronic-deception (ED)** systems emit signals that fool sensors into misjudging the position, speed, heading or characteristics of the vehicle. **ED** increases the Signature of the vehicle for **Sensor** and **Gunnery Tests** made against it, but detecting **ED** is much more difficult than detecting **ECM**.

A vehicle's **electronic counter-deception (ECD)** systems consist of reality-checking electronic circuitry that counters the subtle signals of **ED**. **ECD** counteracts the modifiers imposed by **ED**.

For more information on the use of **ED** and **ECD**, see **Sensors**, page 32.

**ECM/ECCM**
Electronic countermeasures (**ECM**) systems "attack" remote-control networks by jamming their frequencies and degrading the quality of their transmission signals. However, a vehicle's **ECM** systems increase its Signature for certain **Gunnery Tests** made against the vehicle.

Electronic counter-countermeasures (**ECCM**) systems counteract the effects of **ECM** systems for the purposes of **Gunnery Tests**. A drone may also use **ECCM** to reduce the Power of **ECM** jamming attempts made against it.

See **Sensors**, page 31, for more information on **ECM** and **ECCM** systems.

**FLUX**
A vehicle's **Flux Rating** represents the raw electrical power available for its remote control decks, sensors and electronic warfare systems.

The **Flux Rating** determines the effective range of each system, as well as the number of dice used to resist electronic warfare effects.

**LEARNING POOL**
The **Learning Pool** provides robots with dice they can use when performing actions on their own. For more information, see **Robots**, page 67.

**MANEUVER SCORE**
The **Maneuver Score** is a variable rating used during vehicle combat. It reflects the abstract tactical position a vehicle occupies in relation to other vehicles and is based on the following factors: the vehicle type, its current speed, terrain and the results of an open-ended Success Test made by the driver.

For more information, see **The Maneuver Score**, page 41.

**STRESS**
The **Stress Rating** is used to simulate the effects of wear and tear on vehicles. Each time a character pushes a vehicle beyond its normal performance capabilities or loses control of a vehicle, the vehicle's **Stress Rating** increases. And each time the **Stress Rating** of a vehicle increases, the chances of spontaneous vehicle breakdowns or system failures increase.

**INCURRING STRESS**
All new vehicles start with a **Stress Rating** of 0. (If a character obtains a used vehicle, it may have a higher **Stress Rating**. The gamemaster determines the exact rating.)

A character's vehicle may incur **Stress Points** in two ways. First, the character may intentionally push the vehicle beyond its normal performance capabilities by pushing the vehicle beyond its normal **Speed Rating** or using extra dice for **Driving Tests**. Second, a vehicle may incur Stress if its driver fails a **Driving Test** according to the parameters of the **Stress Rule of One**, as described on page 26.

**Breaking the Speed Limit**
A vehicle's **Speed Rating** indicates the maximum sustained speed the vehicle can handle without incurring damage. An aggressive driver can coax a vehicle up to 1.5 times its **Speed Rating**, but any time a vehicle exceeds its **Speed Rating**, it incurs a **Stress Point**.

**Extra Dice for Driving Tests**
A character can improve his chances of success on any **Driving Test** by adding extra dice to his roll in exchange for intentionally incurring **Stress Points**. For every 2 **Stress Points**, the character may add 1 additional die to his **Driving Test**. For vehicles with **Body Ratings** of 1, controlling characters can intentionally inflict 2 **Stress Points** for 1 additional die. For all other vehicles, the number of **Stress Points** intentionally inflicted during a single action may not exceed the vehicle's **Body Rating**.

**Stress Rule of One**
Any time a character really botches a **Driving Test**, his vehicle may incur **Stress Points**. A vehicle incurs 1D6 **Stress Points** whenever the number of 1s rolled on a **Driving Test** equals or exceeds the driver's **Vehicle Skill**.

**STRESS AND SYSTEM FAILURES**
Stress may cause vehicle system failures in three circumstances.

First, system failure may result whenever a vehicle incurs Stress from the **Stress Rule of One**. If the vehicle's **Stress Rating** increases to twice the vehicle's **Body Rating** or greater, one major vehicle system (brakes, steering, transmission and so on) automatically fails. The gamemaster chooses the system that breaks down. The character must make a **Crash Test** to avoid crashing. (See **Crashing**, p. 51.)

System failure may also occur whenever a driver fails a **Driving Test**. In this case, the gamemaster makes a **Stress Test** for the vehicle by rolling 2D6 against the vehicle's **Stress Rating**. If the result is less than the vehicle's **Stress Rating**, one major vehicle system suddenly fails, and the driver must make a **Crash Test** to avoid crashing.

Furthermore, the gamemaster may call for a **Stress Test** any time the vehicle is running.

While running from the local corporate heat, Rigger X tries to negotiate a hairpin turn down a narrow alley. Rigger X has no **Control Pool** dice available for the required **Driving Test**, so he decides to gain some extra dice by intentionally inflicting **Stress Points** on his Eurocar Westwind. The Westwind has a **Body Rating 3**, so Rigger X can inflict only 2 **Stress Points**, which gains him only 1 additional die.

Rigger X's player rolls the dice and fails the **Driving Test**. The gamemaster makes the required **Stress Test** and produces a result of 4. That result is lower than the Westwind's **Stress Rating** of 2, so the **Stress Test** produces no effect.

However, Rigger X's failed **Driving Test** produced five 1s, which equals his **Car Skill** of 5, so the **Stress Rule of One** applies. The gamemaster rolls 1D6 and generates a result of 4, which increases the Westwind's **Stress Rating** to 6. The new rating of 6 is equal to twice the Westwind's **Body Rating** of 3, so the sports car automatically suffers a system failure.

The gamemaster decides that one of the Westwind's tires blows out as the car makes the hairpin turn, and Rigger X must now make a **Crash Test** to keep the sports car from slamming into the alley wall.

**Reducing Stress**
A vehicle's **Stress Rating** may be reduced only through a thorough maintenance overhaul in a Vehicle Facility (see pp. 244, 259 in SRII).

To perform a maintenance overhaul, the vehicle's controlling character makes a **Build/Repair Test** against a target number equal to the vehicle's **Stress Rating** plus 4. Every two successes reduce the **Stress Rating** by 1. The **Stress Rating** cannot be reduced lower than 1—once you push a vehicle beyond its limits, it never performs as well as it did before.

A maintenance overhaul costs 50 nuyen in replacement parts for each **Stress Point** removed, plus labor costs, if the work was performed by a mechanic.

**REPAIRING VEHICLES**
Repairing vehicles is a two-step process that consists of a **Vehicle Build/Repair Test** and buying any needed replacement parts.

The target number for the **Vehicle Build/Repair Test** is the number of damage boxes on the vehicle's **Condition Monitor** which the character wishes to repair, plus 2. The base time for repair is 16 hours per box of vehicle damage. After making the test, divide the base time by the number of successes. The result is the amount of repair time required to repair the damage.

To determine the cost of replacement parts, multiply the number of damage boxes by 5. The resulting figure is the parts cost, expressed as a percentage of the total vehicle cost (including modifications). For example, the parts cost for a vehicle with the Light damage box filled on its Condition Monitor would be 5 percent of the vehicle's total cost (multiply the cost times .05).

Replacement parts have the same Availability Codes and Street Indexes as the vehicle under repair. Characters use their **Vehicle Build/Repair Skills** to make **Acquisition Tests** to obtain parts. Repairs cannot start until the parts show up, so the characters have to wait the full Availability time before commencing with repairs.

Once the character/mechanic obtains the parts, repair work gets underway. Repair work takes the full repair time (as determined by the initial **Vehicle B/R Test**). During this time the vehicle is completely unavailable for use. If, for some reason, the character needs the vehicle back, the mechanic must spend an additional hour putting the vehicle back together and returning it to some kind of operational condition. (This hour does not count toward the repair time). Once the character is done using the vehicle and returns it for repair, the repair time resumes at the point it left off.

### SENSORS

Sensors are the primary—heck, the only method a rigger has of perceiving the world beyond her vehicle. She uses them to see, hear and feel; through them, she is aware of and can identify various elements in the environment surrounding the vehicle, from the pedestrian at the crosswalk to the security guard on patrol to the cop car screaming down the street. A rigger can use sensors to identify and attack targets kilometers away, visually monitor two different locations at the same time, or catch a crooked corp operator on chip.

A vehicle's **Sensor Rating** measures the overall capability of a vehicle's sensors to detect other objects. The rating determines how many dice the vehicle's controlling player may use for **Sensor Tests** and also the components included in the vehicle's sensor systems.

**SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND SENSOR RATINGS**
Sensor systems include numerous components, depending on the overall **Sensor Rating**.

**Rating 0** sensors include rangefinders and ultrasound and laser proximity detectors.

**Rating 1** sensors include proximity detectors, rangefinders, video (but not trideo) cameras, basic radar, signature-recognition software and low-light and telescopic magnification.

Sensors rated **2, 3** and **4** include all of those components plus thermographic imaging.

And **Rating 5** or higher sensors include all components previously mentioned plus flare compensation. All sensors include magnification power equal to 50 times the sensor rating.

**ADDING/UPGRADING COMPONENTS**
Sometimes a character may want to upgrade or add a specific sensor component (for example, installing flare-compensation sensors to a Rating 4 or lower sensor system, or boosting a sensor system's telescopic magnification).

The parts cost for such upgrades is equal to the original cost of the sensors times .10, multiplied by the number of levels the player intends to boost the system for the upgrade. Sensor costs appear in **Vehicle Design and Customization** on page 140.

Skyrie needs to add 100x magnification capacity to her spotter drone's Level 1 sensors. Skyrie's a little short of cash right now, so she decides to upgrade only the magnification rather than the entire sensor system. The base price of the spotter's Level 2 sensors is 15,000 nuyen. Skyrie wants to boost the vision-magnification subsystem by 2 levels, so the cost of the upgrade is 3,000 nuyen (15,000 x .10 = 1,500; 1,500 x 2 = 3,000).

**IMAGE TRANSMISSIONS**
All Level 1 and higher sensor systems can transmit and record audiovisual footage. Footage can be stored as datafiles (which requires onboard memory or a computer), recorded on chips (which requires a video-recording unit) or transmitted to a remote station (which requires a remote-control linkup). Onboard computers and video recorders must be hooked into electronics ports (see **Electronics Port**, p. 139).

Audio/video clips take up 2 megapulses of memory per minute of recording. Audio-only or video-only recordings consume 1 megapulse per minute. Recorded footage may be enlarged up to **Sensor Rating** x 20 magnification before the chip image loses image quality. Note that sensor systems transmit in two-dimensional video images, not trideo images.

Ace, a shadowsnoop reporter, has hired a rigger to conduct surveillance on Mr. Bigg, a crooked politico Ace hopes to expose in a big story. Ace's rigger uses a rotodrone with Level 2 sensors and an onboard palmtop-sized microcomputer unit to monitor Bigg through a hotel window. Ace wants both audio and video proof, and the microcomputer unit has 150 Mp of memory. Each minute of audio/video footage consumes 2 megapulses of memory, so the microcomputer can record up to 75 minutes of audiovisual footage.

Several hours later, Ace meets with the rigger to see what he's captured. While reviewing the footage, Ace notices a small object lying atop the dresser in Bigg's room. He enlarges the video. The maximum enlargement Ace can get of the object is 40x the size of the image before the image loses quality.

Now, had Ace been with the rigger and noticed the object during real-time surveillance, the rigger could have used the sensors' 50x magnification power. That would have enabled Ace to reveal the 500,000¥ bribe on Mr. Bigg's cred reader—which just goes to prove that reporters who don't slog through stakeouts miss out on the big stories.

Gamemasters running media campaigns (see p. 114, **SRComp**) should note that vehicle sensor systems were originally designed for purposes other than news reporting. Consequently, footage obtained from sensor feeds tends to be less sharp than footage recorded on high-resolution portacams. Therefore, sensor footage used in **Perception Tests** adds a +1 target modifier to the test.

**SENSOR TESTS**
To determine if a vehicle's sensors detect another vehicle or object within the sensor's range, the controlling player makes a **Sensor Test**. (See **Sensor and Remote Deck Ranges**, p. 30, for rules on determining sensor ranges.) The vehicle's **Sensor Rating** determines how many dice the player may use for the test.

The target vehicle's **Signature** is the base target number for the test. Apply any appropriate modifiers from the **Sensor Test Modifiers Table**. The number of successes achieved on the test determines what information the **Sensor Test** produces, as described in the **Sensor Test Results Table**.

**SENSOR TEST MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**Direct LOS**: LOS stands for line of sight. This modifier applies if an uninterrupted line of sight exists between the vehicle's sensors and the target objects.

**Urban Setting**: The **Urban Setting** modifier applies if the sensor or the target is located inside a built-up urban area. The modifier reflects the noise, heat and electromagnetic distortion that can hinder detection.

**Fog/Smog/Precipitation**: The presence of natural fog, smog or precipitation increases the difficulty of detecting objects.

**Restricted Terrain**: If the sensing vehicle or target is navigating through **Restricted Terrain**, detecting becomes more difficult.

**Concealed by Spirit**: If a nature spirit is concealing the target using the Concealment power, the target number increases by an amount equal to the spirit's **Force Rating**.

**Tight Terrain**: The **Tight Terrain** modifier applies if the sensor or target is traveling through **Tight Terrain**. The modifier reflects that fact that solid objects hinder sensor readings.

**Sensing Vehicle Damaged**: The **Sensing Vehicle Damaged** modifier applies if the sensing vehicle has suffered damage. The target number modifier is equal to the vehicle's current **Injury Modifier** as shown on the **Damage Modifiers Table** (SRII, p. 112).

### SENSOR AND REMOTE DECK RANGES

Unlike firing ranges for weapons, which extend outward in a straight line, ranges for sensors and remote control decks work more like radar. They cover a 360-degree area of effect with the sensor or deck at the center.

The ranges of sensor systems and remote control decks are determined by the power output of the system's transmitter. The greater the transmitter power, the greater the system's effective range. At the same time, however, a higher power output produces a higher signature and increases the vulnerability of a vehicle or remote control deck to detection.

The power output of a vehicle's sensor system or a remote control deck is measured by the system's **Flux Rating**.

**THE FLUX RATING**
The **Flux Rating** (short for electromagnetic power flux) reflects the power output of transmitters used in communications gear, remote control nets, sensors systems, jammers, ECM and ED. The **Flux Rating Table** shows the Flux Ratings for most electronic devices. The **Flux Rating** can be increased or decreased to boost the signal strength of a transmitter or decrease the electronic signature it produces.

?.?.?.?

**Changing Flux Ratings**
Any electronic device can operate at a lower **Flux Rating** than its standard rating, down to a minimum of 0. Increasing the **Flux Rating** to greater than the default value, however, requires external modifications.

Electronic devices that are connected to a vehicle via an electronics port (see **Electronics Port**, p. 139) may draw extra electrical power from the vehicle's engine to boost their **Flux Ratings**. The maximum number of points a device's **Flux Rating** can be raised in this manner is equal to half the vehicle's **Body Rating**, rounded down.

A vehicle engine can provide boosts to multiple devices, but the total **Flux Points** of all simultaneous boosts may not exceed the vehicle's **Body Rating**.

Vehicle electronic devices may also draw extra **Flux Points** from signal amplifiers mounted on the vehicle. The rating of an amplifier determines how many **Flux Points** the amplifier can provide.

Josie Cruise likes to use her van, Rough Rider, as a command-and-control center. The van is outfitted with a remote-control deck (**Flux 2**), a radio (**Flux 3**), a sensor system (**Flux 8**) and **ECM** (**Flux 2**).

The van has a **Body Rating** of 4, so the van can provide no more than 4 **Flux Points** at any single time, and it cannot boost any single system by more than 2 points. For example, Josie could use the van to provide a 2-point boost to the remote-control deck and 1-point increases to the van's sensor system and **ECM**. However, she could not provide 2-point boosts to all four systems.

In addition to computing effective ranges for sensors, communications gear and certain other electronic devices, **Flux Ratings** are also used when resolving electronic warfare (see **Electronic Warfare**, p. 68).

**FLUX RATING AND RANGE**
The range for any electronic transmitter (communications gear, remote control equipment, sensors, **ECM** and **ED**) is based on the transmitter's **Flux Rating**, as shown on the **Flux Rating and Range Table**.

**Situational Range Modifiers**
External circumstances can temporarily increase or decrease the range created by a standard **Flux Rating**. The modifiers in the **Situational Range Modifiers Table** are applied to a transmitter's **Flux Rating** before the effective range of the transmitter is computed. After determining the modified **Flux Rating**, round the result down to the nearest half, instead of to the nearest whole number.

| Urban environment | -1          |

?.?.?.?

**SITUATIONAL RANGE MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**High elevation** refers to any situation in which an uninterrupted line of sight exists between the transmitter and its receiver or target. This modifier usually applies to aircraft in flight or land-based transmitters perched atop high elevations such as hills or skyscraper roofs.

**ECCM in use** refers to electronic counter-countermeasures, which defeat **ECM** by filtering out electronic garbage and boosting the signal strength of meaningful signals. Because **ECCM** also draws electrical power from the transmitter, subtract half the **ECCM Level** when determining the modified **Flux Rating**.

The **electrical storm** modifier applies whenever a thunderstorm or solar flares are active in the transmitter's area.

**Encryption in use** applies only to radios and remote control decks that are operating under encryption. In these cases, reduce the device's **Flux Rating** by half.

The **humid air** modifier is another environmental modifier. It applies to any transmitter operating during a particularly hot, humid and muggy day. This modifier may also apply to transmitters operating in areas that have an excessively high smog content (Los Angeles is a particularly good example). Do not use this modifier in conjunction with the electrical storm modifier.

The **urban environment** modifier applies to transmitters used in heavily built-up areas, such as downtown districts, industrial parks or any major non-residential area of a mega-sprawl. The modifier also applies if the transmitter is within 1 kilometer of a high-voltage power line.

Josie Cruise is using a CyberSpace Dalmatian recon drone to conduct some long-range snooping. She's operating the drone via a remote-control deck augmented with Rating 4 signal amplifiers (**Flux 6**, 12 km range), located on the roof of a fourteen-story parking garage. Josie's using a crypto-circuit encryption device on her deck, as well as Level 3 **ECCM** (her target really hates unwanted snoopers).

The effective **Flux Rating** for determining the range of her deck transmitter would be 8, calculated as follows.

- Deck **Flux Rating**: 6
- High Elevation: 4
- Encryption: -0.5
- ECCM: -1.5
- **Effective Flux Rating**: 8

This effective **Flux Rating** gives Josie's Dalmatian an 8-kilometer increase in range to 20 kilometers (see **Flux Rating and Range Table**).

### ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES (ECM)

Electronic countermeasures (**ECM**) generate a field of electromagnetic noise that jams radio and sensor electronic wave bands. In game terms, **ECM** increases the difficulty of targeting and locking on to an **ECM**-equipped vehicle. However, **ECM** does not hinder the ability of individual characters to fire weapons directly at a vehicle.

To determine the effectiveness of **ECM**, the targeted vehicle's character and the jamming vehicle's character make an opposed **Success Test**, known as an **ECM Test**. The jamming character rolls a number of dice equal to the **Flux Rating** of his vehicle's **ECM** suite; the test target number is equal to the **Sensor Rating** of the opposing vehicle. The targeted vehicle's character rolls a number of dice equal to the **Flux Rating** of his vehicle's sensors; the test target number is equal to the **ECM rating** of the targeted vehicle.

If the targeted character wins the test, no jamming occurs and the player can proceed with a **Sensor Test**. If the jamming character wins, increase the **Signature** of his vehicle by the number of successes generated on his test.

The **ECM Test** represents the interaction of electronic devices. Therefore, the test does not constitute an action by either character, and is performed outside of the Combat Turn sequence. Turning **ECM** and **ECCM** on or off is considered a Simple Action.

If a single vehicle is attempting to use **ECM**, only the best die roll result applies. The effects are not cumulative. If one jammer is using its **ECM** against many different vehicles, make only one **ECM Test** and compare the number of successes against the **Sensor Ratings** of each of the other vehicles involved.

Riggers may use electronic counter-countermeasures (**ECCM**) to counteract **ECM** jamming. To do so, the two players make an opposed **Success Test**. The counterjammer rolls a number of dice equal to his vehicle's **ECCM Rating** against a target number equal to the **ECM Rating** of his opponent's vehicle. The jammer rolls a number of dice equal to his vehicle's **ECM Rating** against a target number equal to the **ECCM Rating** of his opponent's vehicle. Each success that the counterjammer generates negates 1 success generated by the jammer on his **ECM Test**.

M.C. Jammer is running a shipment of arms across the border from San Angelo into Aztlan-occupied El Paso. As he nears the border in his t-bird (**Signature 4**), he turns on his **ECM** (**Rating 3, Flux 10**) because an Aztlan Aguilar attack helicopter (**Sensor 7, Flux 8**) is closing in.

Jammer's player rolls 10 dice (the t-bird's Flux) against a Target Number 7 (the copter's **Sensor Rating**) and generates 4 successes. The gamemaster rolls 8 dice (the copter's Flux) against a Target Number 3 (the t-bird's **ECM Rating**) and generates 2 successes. Jammer wins; the **Signature Rating** of the t-bird increases by 4, from 4 to 8.

In response to the cloud of snowy static surrounding his field of vision, the Aztlan pilot switches on his **ECCM** (**Rating 4**) to counter the **ECM**. The gamemaster rolls 4 dice (the copter's **ECCM Rating**) against a Target Number 3 (Jammer's **ECM Rating**). Jammer's player rolls 3 dice (**ECM Rating**) against a Target Number 4 (the copter's **ECCM Rating**). This time, the gamemaster generates 3 successes, while M.C. Jammer gets 2. The Aguilar's **ECCM** wins, and its single net success counters one of M.C. Jammer's successes from his **ECM Test** and reduces Jammer's Signature from 8 to 7.

**ELECTRONIC DECEPTION (ED)**
Electronic-deception (**ED**) systems produce subtle electromagnetic radiation which, when superimposed over sensor emissions, feed false or misleading signals to enemy sensors. For example, **ED** can fool a sensor into thinking the target is flying at a different speed or in another direction; additionally, **ED** can confound any attempts to identify the target by its **Signature**.

The **ED** optional rule is both a roleplaying device and a game mechanic. Because **ED** increases the **Signature** of the target, characters may find themselves in situations in which they can see the object that their sensors are misrepresenting. If a rigger suspects a discrepancy between what he sees or knows and what his vehicle's sensors are telling him, the gamemaster can allow the rigger to make a **Perception Test** against a target number equal to his opponent's **ED Rating** plus 4. Success confirms or denies the rigger's suspicions.

In terms of game mechanics, the player controlling the **ED**-equipped vehicle rolls a number of dice equal to the vehicle's **ED Rating** against a target number equal to the opposing vehicle's **Sensor Rating** (or the Intelligence Rating of a missile, if a missile has been fired at the **ED**-equipped vehicle). Each test success increases the **ED**-equipped vehicle's **Signature** by 1. **ED** systems are area-effect systems, and their ranges depend on the **Flux Rating** of the vehicle carrying them.

Electronic-counterdeception (**ECD**) systems use reality-checking measures, such as dead-reckoning navigation and power-attenuation monitors, to negate the effects of **ED** systems. Like its cousin **ECCM**, **ECD** affects specific vehicles rather than a general area.

Activating or deactivating **ED** or **ECD** is considered a Simple Action.

To determine the effectiveness of **ECD**, the player rolls a number of dice equal to his vehicle's **ECD Rating** against a target number equal to the targeted vehicle's **ED Rating**. Each success on the **ECD Test** negates one success from the **ED Test**. **ECD** does not work against standard **ECM**.

Because **ECD** works by filtering out **ED** emissions, **ECD** drains power from a vehicle's electronic transmitter, thus reducing the effective ranges and resistance to jamming of the vehicle's sensors. To reflect this, subtract the vehicle's **ECD Rating** from its **Flux Rating**.

Monkeywrench has been hired to capture the elusive rigger Mirage. For the past six hours he's camped out by Gravelly Lake in Fort Lewis in his vehicle (**Sensor Rating 4**), waiting for Mirage to pass overhead on her run into Tacoma. As Mirage flies over in her helicopter Shadowstorm (**Signature 3, ED Rating 5**), Mirage's player secretly rolls 5 dice against a Target Number 4 (the **Sensor Rating** of Monkeywrench's vehicle). She scores 4 successes, which boosts the copter's Signature from 3 to 7 (but the gamemaster doesn't tell Monkeywrench's player that).

Meanwhile, Monk picks up something through his vehicle sensors. He makes a **Sensor Test** to try to identify the object. The Target Number for the test is 7 (the helicopter's modified Signature, though the gamemaster keeps that a secret from Monkeywrench). Monk's test generates no successes, so his sensors detect only a small flying object—much too small to be a copter. Consequently, Monk goes back to watching the sky. He doesn't realize he's been tricked until he sees Mirage's copter flying past him.

If Monkeywrench had activated his vehicle's **ECD**, his sensors might have correctly identified his elusive quarry before it was too late.

### SPECIAL VEHICLE OPERATIONS

The following rules are designed to resolve the use of unique or special vehicle operations, the use of special vehicle features such as mechanical arms and legs, and the use of vehicles such as air-cushion vehicles.

**LIFTING AND PULLING OBJECTS**
Only vehicles or drones equipped with a crane, winch or boom can lift objects, but any vehicle can pull an object along the ground, provided the object is attached to the vehicle with a tow bar, cables or some other device.

A vehicle or drone can safely lift or pull any object whose weight does not exceed the vehicle's **Load Rating**. Two or more vehicles can safely pull or lift a weight equal to the sum of their **Load Ratings**.

**VEHICLE PULL TESTS**
**Vehicle Pull Tests** reflect a vehicle's capacity to lift or pull objects that weigh up to two times the vehicle's **Load Ratings** for short distances (less than half a kilometer). For example, use a **Pull Test** for such situations as a truck recovering a vehicle that is half buried in mud, using a vehicle's winch to pull the vehicle up a particularly steep cliff, a tugboat trying to dislodge a barge marooned on a sandbar and so on.

A **Vehicle Pull Test** consists of a **Body Test** for the vehicle made against the appropriate target number from the **Pull Test Target Numbers/Modifiers Table**. Players may also intentionally incur **Stress Points** to add extra dice for **Pull Tests** (see **Stress**, p. 25). If the **Pull Test** fails, the vehicle fails to lift or pull the object. However, the vehicle still incurs Stress and suffers other applicable side effects (see **Pull Test Side Effects**, p. 34).

| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| 0 to 1 x Load Rating        | 3             |
| 1.1 to 1.5 x Load Rating    | 5             |
| 1.6 to 2 x Load Rating      | 8             |
| **Condition** | **Target Modifier** |
| Bad conditions              | +1            |
| Terrible conditions         | +3            |
| Object stuck in ground      | +1 to +4      |
| Pulling without rollers (ground) | +4       |
| Vehicle reinforced in place | -2            |

### PULL TEST TABLE KEY

**Bad conditions**: Muddy roads, moderate rolling slopes and similar terrain constitute bad conditions for ground vehicles. In addition, inclement weather, such as rain or snow, may create bad conditions on level ground and dirt roads.

For aircraft, bad conditions include moderate cross winds, snow, rain or other precipitation. For boats pulling barges or floating objects, bad conditions include rough, moderately choppy waters.

**Terrible conditions**: Mud pits, quicksand, steep cliffs, marshes or flooded ground constitute terrible conditions for ground vehicles. In addition, inclement weather can transform normally bad conditions (see above) to terrible ones. Severe weather, such as blizzards, severe thunderstorms or weather whipped up by a great nature spirit using its Storm power, can create terrible conditions in any terrain.

Terrible conditions for aircraft include severe storms, gale-force winds or rushing vertical air drafts. For boats, terrible conditions consist of storm-tossed waves.

**Object stuck in ground**: This modifier applies if the object being pulled or lifted is partially rooted or buried in the ground. The gamemaster sets the exact value of the modifier, based on how deeply the object is buried in the ground. For example, a **Pull Test** made to free a truck that is axle deep in mud would receive a +1 target modifier, while a test for a truck sunk halfway in soft earth would receive a +4 modifier.

**Pulling without rollers**: This modifier applies when a ground vehicle attempts to pull an object across the ground without some sort of rolling support (such as wheels) under the object. However, the gamemaster may waive this modifier if he judges that the ground is slick enough for frictionless pulling (such as an oil-covered or icy surface).

**Vehicle braced in place**: This modifier applies if a ground vehicle is braced with posts or some other device that prevents it from slipping. Bracing a vehicle or removing such braces takes 1 turn. Note that a braced vehicle is completely immobile.

**PULL TEST SIDE EFFECTS**
Though successful **Pull Tests** enable vehicles to lift or carry a weight greater than their **Load Ratings**, the effort of doing so reduces the vehicle's **Speed Rating** during the action and inflicts Stress on the vehicle. These effects are described in the **Pull Test Side Effects Table**.

In addition, any time a vehicle lifts or pulls a weight greater than 1.5 times its **Load Rating**, the vehicle may incur an extra **Stress Point**. In such cases, the controlling character must make a **Body (4) Test** for the vehicle. If the test fails, the vehicle incurs 1 **Stress Point** in addition to any other Stress incurred during the test.

### MECHANICAL ARMS AND LEGS

Some vehicles and many drones feature mechanical arms and legs. The following rules govern the use of vehicle appendages.

**ARM TESTS**
A successful **Arm Test** is required to perform any sort of articulate motion (such as picking up an object, turning a switch and so on) with a vehicle's mechanical arm. The test target number is the vehicle's **Handling Rating**. If a rigger is controlling the vehicle, he may add a number of **Control Pool** dice to this test equal to the rigger's **Quickness Rating**. If a drone is not directly controlled by a rigger (see **Drones**, p. 65) use the drone's **Pilot Rating** in place of the **Quickness Rating**.

The gamemaster may decrease the base target number for simple tasks such as picking up a large object the arm can easily grip, or he can increase it for difficult tasks such as defusing a bomb with a drone's mechanical arm.

**ARM SKILL TESTS**
A character (or a drone's Pilot) may use a skill while using a mechanical arm, for example, using the **Demolitions Skill** to defuse a bomb with a mechanical arm. In such cases, a vehicle with a high **Handling Rating** may make the Skill Test more difficult.

To reflect this, increase the Skill Test target number by 1 for each point that the vehicle's **Handling Rating** exceeds 3. For example, if the vehicle has a **Handling Rating** 4, add 1 to the Skill Test target number. If the vehicle has a **Handling Rating** 5, add 2 and so on.

Sergeant York of the Seattle division of Lone Star is trying to defuse a bomb found in the basement of the Seattle Space Needle. He's using a bomb-defusing drone (**Handling 4**), which is equipped with a set of mechanical arms.

Normally, an **Arm Test** for the drone would use a base Target Number 4, the same as its **Handling Rating**. But the gamemaster decides that this operation is particularly tricky, so she raises the base Target Number to 5.

In addition, York is using his **Demolitions 4** skill for the test. The drone has a **Handling Rating 4**, so that adds another 1-point increase to the target number, for a final Target Number of 6.

York's player rolls 4 dice for the test and gets a 1, 2, 4 and 5. The drone's arms just weren't articulate enough, and the bomb detonates prematurely. The drone is toast and the basement of the Needle is kinda beat up—but York, who is holed up fifty meters away in an armored van, is fine.

**ARM MELEE ATTACKS**
Characters may also use mechanical arms to make melee attacks against other characters. The modifier for a high **Handling Rating** also applies in this situation. The effective **Strength Rating** for the test is equal to the vehicle's **Body Rating** multiplied by itself. Arms can be modified to have higher **Strength Ratings** (see p. 145).

**MECHANICAL LEGS**
Vehicles or drones that use mechanical legs to propel themselves may walk or run using the standard rules for walking and running (see p. 83, SRII). All modifiers that apply to walking or running characters also apply to walking or running vehicles. Similarly, vehicles with legs use the standard character combat rules (see the Combat chapter in SRII) rather than the vehicle combat rules in this book.

The listed **Speed Ratings** for vehicles with legs represent Walking speeds. A vehicle's Running speed is equal to its **Speed Rating** multiplied by 2.5.

Vehicles with legs cannot use their legs to kick during melee combat. Attempting to do so results in the vehicle falling.

**AIR CUSHION VEHICLES**
Air-cushion vehicles (ACVs), more commonly known as hovercraft, cannot climb or pass across any significant slope, because they simply slide down such slopes. The gamemaster determines whether slopes in any given terrain affect hovercraft in this manner.

In addition, the buffering effects of an ACV's rubberized side skirts provide protection when a hovercraft crashes. As a result, ACV damage levels never exceed Serious damage when they crash (see **Vehicle Damage**, p. 49).

Because of their unique operating mode, terrain is defined differently for ACVs, as shown in the **ACV Terrain Classifications Table**.

| Terrain    | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Open       | Relatively flat areas, including rolling plains, calm to slightly choppy water, and normally impassable flat terrain such as swamps, bogs and marshes.                 |
| Normal     | Similar to open terrain, except with scattered moderate obstacles such as light to dense brush, creek beds, mild slopes and so on.                                     |
| Restricted | Any terrain that demands moderately precise movement, such as suburban streets, winding roads, hills and medium/heavy woods.                                           |
| Tight      | Any terrain that requires exceptionally precise maneuvering, including urban settings, badlands, dense woods and stormy seas.                                          |

### AIRCRAFT

Aircraft require a certain amount of flat space to take off or land. The exact amount depends on the aircraft's **Landing/Takeoff profile** and its load of cargo and passengers, as shown on the **Runway Distances Table**.

The first distance listed in each table category applies when an aircraft is carrying cargo and passengers that weigh less than its **Load Rating**. The second distance applies when the weight of cargo and passengers equals or exceeds the aircraft's **Load Rating**.

Note that vertical takeoff and landing (**VTOL**) aircraft do not require runways.

*B = Body

?.?.?.?

**TAKING OFF/LANDING ON UNUSUAL SURFACES**
Any time a character attempts to land or perform a takeoff from an irregular runway surface, in adverse weather conditions or in a combat situation, the controlling character must make a successful **Driving Test** to perform the action. Unusual runways include aircraft carrier decks, automobile highways, water surface landings (without float-plane adaptation), flat stretches of grassland and so on.

When taking off under such circumstances, the test's base Target Number is 3. When landing, the base target number is 4. Any appropriate modifiers from the **Takeoff/Landing Modifiers Table** and the **Driving Test Modifiers Table** (p. 21) apply as well.

In addition, any character attempting to land or perform a takeoff from a rough or uneven surface must make a **Damage Resistance Test** against 6L Damage for the aircraft. This test reflects the damage caused to the craft's landing gear from rocks, gravel, potholes and other features of the rough surface.

| Arrestor cable or crash net in use (landing only) | -1 |

?.?.?.?

**TAKEOFF AND LANDING MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**Cross winds**: The cross winds modifier applies when strong winds blow across the runway. The gamemaster determines when such conditions exist.

**Heavy cross winds**: The heavy cross winds modifier applies when storm-generated winds blow across the runway. The gamemaster determines if such conditions exist.

**Rough/uneven surface**: This modifier applies when a character attempts to land or perform a takeoff from a rough, uneven or gravel surface. This modifier does not apply to smooth but irregular runway surfaces, such as aircraft carrier decks, calm water or asphalt roadways.

**STOL/VSTOL landings/takeoffs**: This modifier reflects the increased difficulty of STOL- and VSTOL-profiled landings or takeoffs.

**Arrestor cable/crash net**: This modifier applies if the runway surface is fitted with an arrestor cable, crash net or other braking device to stop the aircraft after it has landed. Note that only aircraft equipped with a tailhook can use an arrestor cable to brake their landing motion.

### MONORAILS AND TRAINS

Monorail and standard trains are divided into engines and cars. Engines possess their own means of propulsion, while monorail and train cars must be pulled by engines. Note that in most (though not all) city monorail or subway systems, each car in a subway train is considered an "engine" because each car can move on its own.

Though monorails and trains may travel only along fixed rail paths, characters can alter the speeds of monorail or train engines by making **Driving Tests** against the engine's **Handling Rating**. By speeding up or slowing down, a character can throw off a would-be attacker's aim or tactical maneuver. The **Handling Rating** of an engine applies for the entire train that the engine is pulling or pushing. If two or more engines are propelling a train, use the highest **Handling Rating** for the entire train.

Each component of a train, whether an engine or a car, has its own **Body** and **Armor Ratings**. Damage incurred by one car or engine of a train does not affect the other components.

The **Load Rating** of an engine indicates the total weight it can pull, including the weight loaded in cars that the engine is pulling. If two or more engines are in use on a train, add the **Load Ratings**. The **Load Rating** of a car reflects the weight that car alone can carry.

Public monorail networks are found in megasprawls, and high-speed monorail lines, such as the Transrapid Superconductor monorail in the Allied German States, provide passenger service between cities.

Standard rail lines continue to operate throughout the world as well, though in North America standard rail lines are generally relegated to cargo transport duties. In Europe, substantial numbers of passengers use standard rail lines for travel between cities and countries.

### MISSION IMPROBABLE

It started as a simple job. (How many times have you heard that in your life!) I should have known; few things in my life are ever simple, but that's what you get when you're a smuggler and sometime runner, making your living outsmarting the Powers That Be. I'd been hired by a Johnson to retrieve a certain package from an island that lay in Salish territory, which made sending a ground team a difficult proposition. Border crossings and fake datawork and all, you know—and it'd have to be good datawork, in case the Salish authorities decided to get picky about "interlopers" from the UCAS. Good, of course, meaning expensive. Even at my hefty fee, I was cheaper than the usual running team. The Johnson and her up-front cred checked out, so I took the job. A simple helicopter flight out to the island, a quick in-and-out, return trip and a hand-over—easy money, I thought.

I drove my favorite car to the place where I'd hidden my 'copter away. She was my pride and joy, that Airstar—a good sturdy workhorse of a vehicle, with plenty of nifty mods I'd made myself. Any decent rigger, in my opinion, also ought to be a halfway decent mechanic—especially a rigger like me, who couldn't always count on a talented and discreet mechanic turning up if a smuggling run went sour.

I waved hello to the maintenance crew, but didn't make much small talk. No time to chat when biz was waiting to be done. They gave me an all-systems-go report, which was all I needed to hear. I strode up to the Airstar, checked to make sure I had plenty of ammo for my gun, then climbed into the pilot's seat.

I jacked into the helicopter's rig and the virtual heads-up display blossomed before my eyes. Dizziness hit me for a split second; then my mind adjusted to the blizzard of input from the view screens, which were arrayed before me like the many facets of a cut diamond. The screens showed views from every angle, as well as numerous data displays. At the moment, the largest screen, positioned squarely in the center, displayed the status of the Airstar's system as it warmed up.

As I summoned the helicopter to life, I could feel the rumble of the Pratt & Whitney turbojet engines in my chest. The chopper's blades seemed to rotate in sync with the blood pulsing through my limbs. I shifted into forward visual mode; a small icon blinked in a corner of the main view screen, indicating that the hangar door had opened. I was cleared for takeoff.

I pulled my legs into a crouch. The rotating blades went from a whine to a roar in response. I leaped upward and the helicopter rose, slowly but surely soaring upward through the rooftop hangar door. Once I'd gotten several dozen meters above the roof of the warehouse, I set the chopper to hovering briefly as I scanned the Seattle sprawl far below. The low background levels of thermal and electromagnetic radiation emanating from the city showed up as a dull red and green glow in my display. I spotted no active radiation sources, which meant no one was watching right now.

I turned my attention to the navigational screen. It showed my target destination as a red dot, a tiny island of hot brightness in the deep, cool blue of the Pacific Ocean. With another flicker of thought I commanded the screen to display known sensor watch posts. They appeared as small radar-dish icons giving off white waves. I swiftly plotted a course that eluded most of the lookout points, then stretched my arms over my head, twisted my body toward Puget Sound, and swept my arms down to my sides. The Airstar turned and sped toward the moonlight that glinted off the Sound.

This was going to be a cakewalk. Breeze on out to the target, pick up the package and come back home. I'd be back in time for happy hour at the Shack—and this time able to pay my tab, and just maybe buy a round or three for a certain pretty lady I'd had my eye on recently. Yep, this was just the kind of job I liked best ...

Suddenly the chopper's warning klaxons started screaming. I turned my head and my visual display rotated until the rear view screen occupied my central window. On it I saw two dark flecks against the pink and gray pre-dawn sky. The Airstar's Identify Friend or Foe transponders identified the craft as two F-B Eagle interceptors from the UCASAF's Fifth Air Wing based at McChord.

Before I could make another move, bright spurts of thermographic orange blossomed under the wings of both interceptors and the helicopter's targeting alarm began to shriek. A warning message flashed on my heads-up display—both interceptors had locked on to the Airstar and fired air-to-air missiles.

Instinctively, I arched my body toward the coastline, a movement that turned the helicopter. At the same time I started kicking my legs furiously like an Olympic swimmer, sending the chopper screaming toward the land. But my evasive action didn't fool the missiles' targeting sensors. The deadly projectiles twisted and dove after me.

Time for Plan B, then. I focused my mind on the right control, and a giant red "PANIC" button materialized under my left hand. I slapped the button. Explosive charges planted at strategic points along the chopper's body detonated, destroying the brackets that held the Airstar's outer shell in place. As the shell fell away, it revealed a second skin coated with radarbane.

I knew I wasn't out of trouble yet. I jackknifed my body toward the floor like a diver, and five small parachutes blossomed from the 'copter as it plunged into a power dive. Thermite flares swung from two of the chutes, bunched strips of aluminum chaff from two more. The last chute supported a small rocket, hardly large enough to dent a paper airplane, but containing a transponder and flare that mimicked the Airstar's thermal and electromagnetic signature. The chopper's radarbane skin would cloak it from the missile's targeting sensors, and the chaff and flares would temporarily confuse the two missiles, which would then lock on to the decoy rocket.

I hoped.

Scant seconds after I'd punched the panic button I felt my virtual body convulse as the shock waves from two explosions rocked the helicopter. I twisted around, bringing the chopper face-to-face with my two attackers, and the direction-finding axes of the Airstar's targeting program appeared on the main view screen. I selected and armed two anti-radiation missiles, then cut them loose as soon as I heard the lock-on chirp twice. The ARMs appeared like two streaks against the sky as they homed in on the strong signals from the pursuing flyboys' jammers. A half-second later the 'copter's targeting alarm fell silent, which told me that the missiles had destroyed the F-Bs' targeting sensors. (Thank heaven for ARMs. They lock on to a target's emissions, so the stronger your opponent's sensors and jammers, the better the chance your ARMs will find their mark. The F-Bs' **ECM** suites would have spiked most of my weapons for sure if the flyboys'd had a chance to use them. But the ARMs homed in on the jammer signals and saved my hoop.)

Both pursuing planes wavered for a few seconds as small explosions erupted in their noses where their targeting sensors had been. Then the flyboys swung around and streaked past me, strafing the Airstar with miniguns. I kept the chopper diving toward the shoreline; I could feel my skin twitching as I pushed the Airstar beyond its limits and its body buckled under the strain.

Before the flyboys could swing around for a second pass, a green wave of Salish radar passed over my view screen. I'd entered Salish-Shidhe airspace—safe territory for me as far as my two hunters were concerned. (Though not exactly safe per se ... ) The zoomies broke off pursuit, apparently unwilling to risk an international incident for one lone 'copter. After a few seconds I breathed a sigh of relief. I'd heard no warnings from Salish air-traffic control, which meant it hadn't detected me.

I swung the Airstar lower until it almost skimmed the treetops—best way to avoid future encounters—while a nagging question formed in the back of my mind. Why had the two zoomies tried to shoot me down with no warning? I'd had plenty of run-ins with Salish and UCAS jet jockeys during past smuggling runs, but they'd never opened fire without issuing some kind of warning or threat first. This geek-first-warn-later bulldrek—that was a Lone Star trick. Not the kind of thing I was used to getting from fellow flyers, even if they were the Law and I wasn't.

The glowing orange orb of the sun, just rising over the horizon ahead of me, was beginning to dispel the shadows on the land below. Too bad it could shed no light on my question. I'd eluded my flying foes for now, but I couldn't run forever. Sooner or later I had to go to ground, and then they'd find me.

Well, what the hell. Maybe I could still do what I'd been hired to do before the cavalry showed up.

I landed the Airstar right where the Johnson had told me to, then holstered my Ingram and set out to retrieve the package. I briefly wondered what was in it—something worth sending air jockeys after a lone 'copter, maybe? And how had they known who I was?—but swiftly dismissed such speculation as useless. Smugglers who live to spend their earnings learn not to ask unnecessary questions.

The McNeil Island Penitentiary Compound was looming dead ahead. It had been abandoned for years, but the Johnson had warned me that "unfriendly people" would likely be watching the place. I knew I'd have to make an unorthodox entrance, but I still wasn't looking forward to it. I reached the entry spot, took a deep breath, braced myself, and lowered myself down into the storm sewer that led to the compound's central building.

After wading through stinking raw sewage for what seemed like hours, I finally came to the manhole I was looking for. I shoved it to one side, pulled myself up out of the sewer and squeezed through the narrow aperture, cursing under my breath all the while. Then, squatting on the damp concrete floor under a heavy grating, I looked around as best I could in the dim light.

I'd fetched up in a maintenance trench under the ground floor of the main building. I could see the outlines of power cables and plumbing pipes; they smelled of rust and rot. Hulking overhead, toward the back of the trench, I spotted several giant shadows—turbines, which meant I must be under the plant's power room.

I was reaching up to lift the grating when a faint grinding noise froze me in place. Then I heard the telltale whine of a laboring combustion engine, growing gradually louder as it came my way. Twisting my head over my shoulder, I saw a dark shadow rumble over the grating. I withdrew my fingers as the thing rolled to a stop directly above me.

It was a patrol drone—an FMC Sentinel. Only slightly larger than a kid's wagon, it was equipped with tank treads to cover rough terrain, and it packed enough firepower to ruin any shadowrunner's day. If it detected me, it would certainly ruin mine.

Soundlessly I unlatched the magazine in my Ingram, then reached into my cargo pocket and withdrew a 30-round clip of armor-piercing, silicone-coated depleted-uranium shells. As quietly as I could, I loaded the clip, then flipped the fire-mode selector switch to AUTO and poked the barrel between the chinks in the grating.

For the first time that night I was glad to be skulking in a sewer. If I'd run into the Sentinel above ground, I wouldn't have stood a chance of destroying it before it spotted me. But like most drones designed for security work and perimeter detail, the Sentinel's underbelly was fitted with light armor. After all, no one expects a security drone to run into anti-tank mines. Sparks flew as I cut loose with the Ingram and punched several rounds through the Sentinel's steel skin. The bullets ripping into its innards touched off electrical fires inside the drone, making it sputter and pop. A loud explosion knocked me backward as a stray round burst through the fuel tank. I scurried away as burning fuel began raining down into the trench.

Within minutes the place was crawling with drones. I had to expend the rest of my **APDU** and one thermite grenade before I found a ventilation duct to hide in. Crawling through the network of ventilation shafts up to the top floor took me about two hours. When I finally squirmed out of the narrow shaft, I landed clumsily in a darkened hallway. To my right was a security door, with an electronic keypad directly above the knob. Assuming I'd kept the map in my head straight through all the twists and turns of the ventilator shafts, the package should be inside.

I loaded another magazine, emptied the Ingram into the lock and kicked the door open. A quick reload later, I cautiously surveyed the room. It had been some grunt's office once, indistinguishable from a hundred others. A computer terminal sat on top of a cheap plaswood desk, both of them covered with dust.

I walked over to the terminal. A chip was loaded in one of its drive slots. I opened the desk's top drawer—just as I'd hoped, there were a few thumbtacks still rolling around in it. I took out a thumbtack, stuck its pointy end in the slot and wiggled it around until the chip popped out. Package retrieved.

I'd hardly turned around when alarm klaxons started blaring all around me. The sound of running feet came from the corridor outside; no exit that way. I turned wildly toward the office's sole window, only to see a curtain of thin steel plates ripple down to cover it. The sharp thud of the door hitting the wall made me spin back around, Ingram raised, to confront my new enemy—four armored security guards whose uniform patches I didn't recognize. All of their guns were pointed straight at me.

For about five seconds, nobody moved. Then I heard a familiar voice from the hallway.

"Thank you, gentlemen," said my Johnson as she sauntered into the room. "You can put the guns away now."

As the sec-boys lowered their weapons, the Johnson gave me a brilliant smile. "Congratulations, Roy," she said. "You passed."

I eased my grip on the Ingram a fraction ... but only a fraction. "This was a test? Just a test?"

"I needed to find out if you were worth your reputation," she answered. "And it seems you are. You've been quite resourceful. I can't afford anything less—not for the job I have in mind."

"And the chip?" Curiosity was fighting with anger now. I decided it couldn't hurt me to let curiosity win. "Is it something, or just worthless drek?"

"Oh, it's something, all right." The Johnson laughed softly. "Consider it your payment for today's work, should you decide you'd rather not be part of the real mission." She gave me a measuring look, then continued. "Would you care to hear about it?"

"You'd really let me leave now? Just like that?"

"Just like that. I need willing participants, Roy, not just hired guns who might decide to cut and run when things get more dangerous than they bargained for. From what I learned about you before setting up this little excursion, I'd say you might be a willing participant—once you know everything. But for the moment ... " She gave me another sizing-up look. "What are your feelings about the Draco Foundation?"

I nearly dropped the Ingram in surprise. "Can't say I have any, one way or the other," I managed to say after a moment. "Why? Are you working for them or against them?"

"For." Another soft laugh. "Oh, definitely for. Which I'll prove to your satisfaction, if you want to hear about the job. Over dinner. You choose the restaurant—though I will say, I'm partial to Thai."

I holstered the Ingram. "I know a place in Tacoma. Roong Petch. Hole in the wall, but it serves the best yellow curry in town."

"You can still back out after dinner," she said. "I'll tell you enough to let you know what you're likely in for, not so much that you'll be a danger to us if you refuse. As I said, I need more than just hired guns."

I nodded toward the door. "Time's wasting, ma'am—and I'm getting hungry."

She smiled at that—a warm smile that lit up her blue eyes. I had a nagging feeling that I'd seen her somewhere before—and not on this job, either—but dismissed it as smuggler's paranoia. As I followed her and the sec-boys out of the room, I wondered just what kind of drek-pile I might be getting myself into. You know the old saying—never deal with a dragon, or with a dragon's employees.

### VEHICLE COMBAT

The vehicle combat system in this chapter replaces the system described on pages 105-9 of the **Shadowrun, Second Edition** rulebook. This vehicle combat system is intended to preserve the spirit, if not the mechanics, of the existing **Shadowrun** rules by providing a simple, mapless system for resolving vehicle combat and individual character actions simultaneously.

This section lays the foundation for the new vehicle combat system and provides rules for resolving vehicle damage caused by weapons fire, crashes and collisions with objects such as walls, passengers and other vehicles; rules for firing vehicle weapons and vehicles and magic. For drone rules, see **Drones**, p. 62.

**THE MANEUVER SCORE**
The **Maneuver Score** is the cornerstone of the vehicle combat system. This rating measures the relative tactical advantage of a vehicle engaged in combat and is used when resolving nearly all vehicle combat maneuvers. Generally, a character receives bonuses or penalties for his vehicle combat maneuvers based on the current **Maneuver Score** of his vehicle. (The specific application of the **Maneuver Score** is described in the rules for each vehicle combat maneuver.)

The **Maneuver Score** consists of four components: **Vehicle Points, Terrain Points, Speed Points** and **Driver Points**. During each Combat Turn, these components—and the **Maneuver Score** itself—change to reflect the shifting conditions of combat. Either players or gamemasters may monitor these changing scores, depending on the preferences of the group.

If a pedestrian and a vehicle interact, resolve the situation by assigning the pedestrian a **Maneuver Score** equal to his **Quickness**.

**DETERMINING THE MANEUVER SCORE**
The **Maneuver Score** is determined by adding together a vehicle's **Vehicle Points, Terrain Points, Speed Points** and **Driver Points** during a Combat Turn. Once a vehicle's **Maneuver Score** is determined for a turn, that score is used throughout the turn. When the next Combat Turn begins, the four components and the **Maneuver Score** are re-calculated.

**Vehicle Points**
The **Vehicle Points** for a turn may be positive or negative depending on the type of vehicle a character is driving. The **Vehicle Points Table** lists the **Vehicle Points** for the various vehicle types.

?.?.?.?

**Speed Points**
To determine a vehicle's **Speed Points**, divide the vehicle's speed by ten and round down the result.

**Driver Points**
The player makes an **Open Test** using the relevant **Vehicle Skill** to generate his **Driver Points** (see **Open Tests**, below). Keep a separate tally of the **Driver Points** generated from the **Open Test**; these points also determine the first Combat Phase in which passengers can act. (See **Passenger Actions during Vehicle Combat**, p. 49, for more information.)

**OPEN TESTS**
Unlike standard **Success** or **Opposed Tests**, in which players attempt to achieve set target numbers with their dice rolls, **Open Tests** have no target numbers. Instead, the result of the **Open Test** may serve as a target number for subsequent tests or generate other numbers, such as **Driver Points**. When making an **Open Test**, a player rolls a number of dice equal to the skill or attribute he is using for the test. The player then discards all but the highest single die result.

The **Rule of Six** (p. 32, SRII) does apply to **Open Tests**; a player can re-roll any die that produces a "6" and add the result.

Rich rolls 5 dice on an **Open Test**. He scores 6, 6, 4, 3, and 1. Re-rolling the two 6s, he achieves a 6 and 2, so he re-rolls the 6 yet again and gets a result of 4. That gives Rich a result of 16 (6 + 6 + 4) for a single six-sided die.

**VEHICLE COMBAT TURN SEQUENCE**
The **Vehicle Combat Turn** uses the following sequence. Note that gamemasters must calculate **Maneuver Scores** for all NPC vehicles.

1.  Determine starting distance and speeds (first Combat Turn only).
2.  Determine the **Vehicle, Terrain** and **Speed Points** for each vehicle.
3.  Allocate **Control Pool** dice.
4.  Determine **Driver Points** and calculate the final vehicle **Maneuver Scores** for the Combat Turn.
5.  Determine Initiative.
6.  Characters take actions and resolve results.
7.  Determine changes in speed, distance or terrain.
8.  Begin a new Combat Turn.

---

### VEHICLE COMBAT (CONTINUED)

**1. Determine starting distances and speeds (first Combat Turn only).**
Before vehicle combat begins, the gamemaster determines the starting speeds of NPC vehicles and distances between each vehicle. Vehicles that are stopped, parked or idling begin with starting Speeds of 0. Players may declare the starting speeds of their vehicles, though the gamemaster chooses the starting speed of any vehicle whose driver is incapacitated or unconscious.

All **Dice Pools** for drivers, passengers and pedestrians also refresh, per standard Combat Turn rules (p. 78, SRII).

**2. Determine the Vehicle, Terrain and Speed Points for each vehicle.**
After determining the **Vehicle, Terrain** and **Speed Points** for each vehicle (see the preceding **Vehicle Points, Terrain Points** and **Speed Points** subsections), combine these values to produce a partial **Maneuver Score** for each vehicle.

**3. Allocate Control Pool dice.**
Each player may allocate **Control Pool** dice for the **Open Test** used to determine his **Driver Points** for the turn (see preceding **Driver Points** subsection for details). Dice allocated for this test are not available for any other purpose during the turn. These dice do not refresh at the start of each Combat Phase; they refresh at the end of the Combat Turn. All remaining **Control Pool** dice refresh per standard rules and may be used for **Driving Tests** during each phase of the character's Initiative.

**4. Determine Driver Points and finalize vehicle Maneuver Scores for the Combat Turn.**
Each player makes an **Open Test** to determine each vehicle's **Driver Points** (gamemasters make the test for NPC vehicles). Add the **Driver Points** to the partial **Maneuver Scores** generated in Step 2. The results are the **Maneuver Score** for each vehicle.

**5. Determine Initiative.**
Every player rolls Initiative for his character at this time—whether the character is driving a vehicle, riding as a passenger or standing on the ground as a pedestrian.

Remember that Initiative dice bonuses apply only to riggers who are jacked into vehicles. Bonuses for boosted and wired reflexes, physical adept increases and magic do NOT apply for drivers when determining Initiative.

Passenger characters must hold their actions until the phase indicated by the driver's **Driver Points** (see **Passenger Actions during Vehicle Combat**, p. 49).

**6. Characters take actions and resolve results.**
All characters (drivers, passengers and pedestrians) take their actions. The order in which characters act is determined by their Initiative results, per standard combat rules (pp. 78-80, SRII). Resolve all character actions.

**7. Determine changes in speed, distance and terrain.**
After resolving all actions, the gamemaster determines if any vehicles have changed speed, based on their actions during the turn. If necessary, the gamemaster calculates changes in distances between vehicles, based on the new speeds.

The gamemaster also decides if any vehicles have moved into a different terrain type during the Combat Turn. If so, terrain changes take effect during this phase.

**8. Begin a new Combat Turn.**
Begin a new Combat Turn. Distances and speeds have already been determined for the new turn, so start with Step 2. **Control Pool Dice** allocated for **Driver Points Open Tests** refresh at this time.

Rigger X is trying to make a fast getaway from two Lone Star cruisers hot on his tail. At the beginning of the chase, Rigger X's Mach 6 (his souped-up Westwind 2000) is burning rubber at a speed of 250 meters per Combat Turn, while the pursuing cops are doing 275 meters per turn and are a few blocks behind him. X and his pursuers are roaring down Central Avenue, a five-lane city street. Fortunately, only very light traffic is on the street.

The starting distance and speeds have already been set, so Rigger X's player and the gamemaster now determine the **Vehicle, Terrain** and **Speed Points** for each vehicle. Their calculations might look like this:

**Mach 6**
- Sports car: +3 Vehicle Pts.
- Normal terrain: -2 Terrain Pts.
- 250 m/turn: 25 Speed Pts.
- **Partial Maneuver Score**: 26

**Lone Star Cruisers**
- Regular car: 0 Vehicle Pts.
- Normal terrain: -2 Terrain Pts.
- 275 m/turn: 27 Speed Pts.
- **Partial Maneuver Score**: 25

Allocating **Control Pool** Dice is the next step. Rigger X decides to allocate 4 of his 7 **Control Pool Dice** for the **Driver Points Open Test**. That leaves Rigger X with only 3 **Control Dice** available for other actions during the Combat Turn.

The cops driving the Lone Star Cruisers are NPCs, so they use their **Professional Rating** dice (Rating 2) in place of **Control Pool Dice**. (Because they are NPCs, the cops may also use their 2 Threat/Professional Rating dice for **Success Tests**.)

Now the player and gamemaster make **Open Tests** to determine the **Driver Points** for their characters. Rigger X has a **Car Skill 5** and has allocated 4 **Control Pool** dice for the test, so he rolls 9 dice and obtains the following results: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5 and 6. Re-rolling the 6, he gets a result of 5, which makes his highest die result 11. That gives Rigger X 11 **Driver Points**.

The gamemaster makes the **Open Tests** for the two cops. Both cops have **Car Skill 3** and 2 **Professional Rating** dice, so the gamemaster rolls 5 dice for each car. The first (Cruiser #1) generates a 2, 3, 5, 6 and 6; re-rolling the two 6s, the gamemaster gets a 1 and 2, so the final tally is 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8. That gives Cruiser #1 8 **Driver Points**.

On the **Open Test** for Cruiser #2, the gamemaster rolls a 3, 4, 5, 6 and 6. Re-rolling the two 6s produces a 3 and 6. Re-rolling the 6 again, the gamemaster gets a 3, so the highest die result is 15. That gives Cruiser #2 15 **Driver Points**.

Now the player and gamemaster add the **Driver Points** to their characters' partial **Maneuver Scores**. That gives the characters the following **Maneuver Scores** for the turn:

| Character   | Maneuver Score |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| Rigger X    | 11 + 26 = 37   |
| Cruiser #1  | 8 + 25 = 33    |
| Cruiser #2  | 15 + 25 = 40   |

At this point, all the player characters involved—including Rigger X's passengers and the other cops riding shotgun in the two cruisers—make **Initiative Tests**, and the standard Combat Turn begins.

**VEHICLE ACTIONS**
In addition to standard character actions, such as activating cyberware, observing in detail, non-combat **Driving Tests** and so on, drivers can perform the following vehicle actions. Note that all these actions are considered Complex Actions.

- **Accelerating/Braking**: The driver attempts to change his vehicle's speed, either to close the distance with another vehicle or to increase his distance from other vehicles.
- **Positioning**: The driver attempts to maneuver his vehicle into a better tactical position for fighting.
- **Ramming**: The driver attempts to ram another vehicle with his vehicle.
- **Hiding**: The driver attempts to break contact with another vehicle(s).
- **Performing a Non-Driving Action**: Non-driving actions include firing personal weapons, using onboard electronics, activating cyberware and so on.

If a pursuing vehicle's speed increase is equal to or greater than the distance between the vehicle and its target, multiplied by 2, the vehicle can ram the targeted vehicle or pedestrian during the controlling player's next available action.

| Driver has VCR implant                                          | -(VCR cyberware rating) |

?.?.?.?

**ACCELERATE/BRAKE TARGET MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**Higher/Lower Maneuver Score**: If the **Maneuver Score** of the driver's vehicle exceeds the **Maneuver Score** of the vehicle he is chasing or fleeing, the target number for his **Driving Test** is reduced, as shown on the table. If the **Maneuver Score** of the opposing vehicle exceeds the score of the driver's vehicle, the target number is increased, as shown. If a vehicle is fleeing or chasing more than one vehicle, use the highest **Maneuver Score** of the opposing vehicles when determining this modifier.

**Fleeing from more than one vehicle**: If the driver is attempting to flee from two or more vehicles, apply a +1 target modifier for each additional vehicle. For example, a vehicle fleeing 2 opposing vehicles receives a +1 target modifier, while a vehicle fleeing 3 opposing vehicles receives a +2 modifier.

**Autonav is active**: An active autonavigation system hinders combat maneuvers because it will attempt to decrease the vehicle's speed to a safe limit. If a vehicle's autonav system is active, apply a target modifier equal to the vehicle's **Autonav Rating**. Turning the autonavigation system on or off is a Simple Action; if the driver is jacked into a vehicle, these are Free Actions.

**VCR implant**: If the driver is a rigger jacked into a rigged vehicle, reduce the target number by an amount equal to the rigger's **VCR** cyberware rating.

**ACCELERATING/BRAKING**
Accelerating and braking are two related actions. In both cases, the driver is trying to change his vehicle's speed. To resolve either action, the driver makes a **Driving Test** against the vehicle's **Handling**. Apply any appropriate modifiers from the **Accelerate/Brake Target Modifiers Table**.

If the **Accelerating/Braking Test** succeeds, the vehicle increases or decreases its current speed. The increase or decrease is equal to the vehicle's **Acceleration Rating**, multiplied by the number of successes generated on the test. However, no vehicle can exceed its **Speed Rating** by more than 50 (**Speed Rating** times 1.5) percent of the rating. All vehicles receive 1 **Stress Point** whenever they exceed their **Speed Ratings**.

Cruiser #1 and Cruiser #2 are only 300 meters behind Rigger X, who decides to accelerate in an attempt to lose the two Lone Star cars.

The base target number for the **Accelerating Test** is the Mach 6's **Handling Rating** of 3. The following target modifiers also apply:

- Cruiser #2's **Maneuver Score** of 40 exceeds Mach 6's score by 10 or less: +2
- Rigger X is fleeing two vehicles: +1
- The Mach 6's current speed of 250 m/turn exceeds its **Speed Rating** of 210: +1
- Normal terrain: 0
- Rigger X has a Level 2 **VCR** and is jacked into the Mach 6: -2
- **Final target modifier**: +2

That leaves Rigger X with a Target Number 5 for the test. Rigger X, who has **Car Skill 5**, decides to spend his remaining 3 **Control Pool Dice** on the test. Rolling 8 dice, he achieves 2 successes. Multiplying the 2 successes by the Mach 6's **Acceleration Rating** of 18 generates a result of 36. This gives the Mach 6 a current speed of 286, well below the car's limit of 315 meters per turn (210 x 1.5). The Mach 6 does, however, receive 1 **Stress Point** for exceeding its **Speed Rating**.

Cruiser #2 acts next and decides to close in on Rigger X. His vehicle has a **Handling Rating 4**, so the target number for the **Driving Test** is 4. The following target modifiers apply:

- Cruiser #2's **Maneuver Score** exceeds Rigger X's score by 10 or less: -2
- The car's current speed of 275 m/turn exceeds the car's **Speed Rating** of 240: +1
- Normal terrain: 0
- The cruiser's Level 3 **Autonav** is active: +3
- **Final target modifier**: +2

That gives Cruiser #2 a Target Number 6 for the test. The gamemaster rolls 5 dice for the test (3 for the driver's **Car Skill** and 2 for his **Professional Rating**). The test yields 3 successes, so Cruiser #2's speed increases by 42 (**Acceleration Rating** of 14 x 3 successes = 42). That means Cruiser #2 speeds up to 317 meters per turn.

Let's skip to the end of the turn for a moment and assume that no other driving actions take place during the turn. The Mach 6's new speed is 286, while Cruiser #2's new speed is 317. 317 minus 286 equals 31, so Cruiser #2 closes 31 meters on the Mach 6 during the turn. The starting distance at the beginning of the turn was 300 meters, so at the start of the next turn Cruiser #2 is 269 meters behind Rigger X.

### VEHICLE COMBAT

**POSITIONING**
Positioning a vehicle enables a driver to place his vehicle in a better tactical position for subsequent actions. In game terms, a successful positioning attempt gives a vehicle a higher **Maneuver Score** for the next Combat Turn, which puts the vehicle at a tactical advantage and gives its passengers more opportunities to act.

A driver can also make a positioning attempt to bring his vehicle to a stop at a particular point in order to provide a covering position for characters to enter, exit, mount or dismount the vehicle.

To position a vehicle, the driver makes a **Positioning Test**, using his Driving Skill, against a target number equal to his vehicle's **Handling Rating**. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the **Positioning Target Modifiers Table**. Record the number of successes generated on the test and add this value to the driver's **Driver Points** at the start of the next Combat Turn. These additional **Driver Points** increase the vehicle's **Maneuver Score** and allow passengers to act during later Combat Phases of the turn (see **Passenger Actions during Vehicle Combat**, p. 49).

?.?.?.?

Cruiser #1's driver decides to position his vehicle for better tactical advantage against the Mach 6. The base target number for the **Positioning Test** is the car's **Handling Rating** of 4, with the following modifiers:

- Cruiser's speed of 275 m/turn exceeds its **Speed Rating** of 240: +1
- Normal terrain: 0
- The cruiser's Autonav is off: 0
- **Final target modifier**: +1

That produces a final Target Number 5 for the test. The gamemaster rolls 5 dice for the driver (**Car 3** plus 2 for the cop's **Professional Rating**) and generates only one success. At the start of the next turn, Cruiser #1 can add 1 to the result of the **Open Test** to determine the **Driver Points** for Cruiser #1's **Maneuver Score**.

If the driver is attempting to position his vehicle to stop at a particular point, the gamemaster determines how far the vehicle must travel to reach the desired spot. The result of the **Positioning Test** is multiplied by the vehicle's **Acceleration Rating** to determine how much of the distance the vehicle can cover. If the final result equals or exceeds the required distance, the driver is able to pull off the maneuver. Otherwise, the positioning attempt fails.

Josie Cruise is transporting a runner team in her helicopter Angelfire (**Acceleration 14**) to a designated landing zone outside a Seretech research compound, 140 meters from Angelfire's current location. Josie decides to make a positioning attempt to bring Angelfire to a hover right above the landing zone. Her **Positioning Test** generates 4 successes, however, which means that Angelfire only travels 56 meters (4 x 14) during the attempt. This leaves her 84 meters short of the landing zone.

**RAMMING**
In a ramming attempt, the driver attempts to hit another vehicle or a pedestrian with his own vehicle.

First, the distance between the vehicle and its target must be less than the vehicle's **Acceleration Rating**. If the distance is greater, the vehicle driver can accelerate to close the distance (see **Accelerating/Braking**, p. 45). If the acceleration test produces a speed change greater than twice the distance, the vehicle driver may attempt to ram the target on his next available action.

Drivers may also make ramming attempts to break through walls or run down pedestrians.

To resolve a ramming attempt, the controlling player makes a **Ramming Test** using his **Driving Skill** against a target number equal to his vehicle's **Handling Rating**. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the **Ramming Target Modifiers Table**. If the test succeeds, the vehicle collides with the target.

Both the ramming vehicle and the target make **Damage Resistance Tests** against Collision Damage (see **Vehicle Damage from Impact**, p. 50). To determine the Power of the Damage Code, calculate the difference in speed between the two vehicles, then divide the result by 10 and round that number up to the nearest whole number. The attacker reduces the Power of the collision damage by his vehicle's **Body Rating** multiplied by the number of successes on his test. For the Damage Level, use the level corresponding to the difference in speed between the two vehicles, as shown on the **Impact Damage Levels Table** (p. 50). Both players may add available **Control Pool** dice to the **Damage Resistance Test**.

If either vehicle sustains damage from the ram, the controlling player must make a **Crash Test** (see **Crashing**, p. 51).

A desperate Rigger X decides to take out one of the Lone Star cruisers by ramming it. His Mach 6 has a **Maneuver Score** of 46, versus Cruiser #2's **Maneuver Score** of 35, so he figures the tactic will work.

Too much distance separates the Mach 6 from the cruisers, so Rigger X makes a **Braking Test**. The test nets a speed change of 110 meters per turn, which slows the Mach 6 down to 176 meters per turn. That figure still exceeds the 50 meters that separate the Mach 6 and the nearest cruiser (Cruiser #2), so Rigger X must wait until the next phase before he can ram the cruiser.

Having nothing to lose, Rigger X attempts to ram the cop car on his next action. The **Ramming Test** base target number is 3 (the Mach 6's **Handling Rating**), and the following modifiers apply:

- Attacker's **Maneuver Score** exceeds target's by 11 or more: -4
- Normal terrain: 0
- Attacker has a Level 2 **VCR**: -2

The final Target Number is 3 - 4 - 2, or -3, which rounds up to 2 (since no target number can have a value less than 2).

Rigger X decides not to use any **Control Pool** dice, so he rolls 5 dice for the test (he has **Car Skill 5**). The test generates 5 successes, so the Mach 6 collides with Cruiser #2.

**HIDING**
To hide from or break contact with another vehicle, the controlling player makes a **Hiding Test** using his **Driving Skill** against a base target number equal to his vehicle's **Handling Rating**. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the **Hiding Target Modifiers Table**.

If the test succeeds, the vehicle breaks contact with the other vehicle(s) and also receives an **Escape Bonus** equal to the number of successes generated in the test. At the start of the next Combat Turn, the driver may add the **Escape Bonus** to his **Driver Points**. The **Escape Bonus** applies each Combat Turn until the other vehicle(s) relocate the hiding vehicle (see **Relocating**, p. 49) or give up trying.

In addition, a vehicle attempting to relocate the hiding vehicle must add the number of successes in the **Hiding Test** to the target number for the **Relocating Test**.

Enough positioning! Rigger X decides it's time to give Cruiser #1 the slip.

The Mach 6's **Maneuver Score** is 46, while Cruiser #1's score is 36. Both vehicles are now roaring down King Street at 250 meters/turn.

The base target number for Rigger X's **Hiding Test** is 6 (the Mach 6's **Handling Rating**), and the following target modifiers apply:

- Base Target Number: 6
- Hiding vehicle's **Maneuver Score** exceeds opponent's by 10 or less: -2
- The Mach 6 is exceeding its **Speed Rating**: +2
- Restricted terrain: 0
- Rigger X has a Level 2 **VCR**: -2
- **Final target number**: 4

Rigger X rolls 5 dice for the test (his **Car Skill rating** is 5). The test yields 4 successes, so the Mach 6 gives Cruiser #1 the slip for the rest of the Combat Turn. In addition, Rigger X receives a 4-point **Escape Bonus** on his **Driver Points Open Tests** until the pursuing vehicle relocates the Mach 6 or gives up the attempt.

**RELOCATING**
Any time a vehicle makes a successful hiding attempt and breaks contact, the pursuing vehicle's character can attempt to relocate the hiding vehicle by making a **Relocating Test**. To make a **Relocating Test**, the player makes a **Perception Test** against a target number equal to the hiding vehicle's **Signature**. Apply all appropriate target modifiers from the **Relocating Target Modifiers Table**.

Now, Cruiser #1 isn't going to let Racer X simply run off, so the Lone Star driver attempts to relocate the Mach 6.

Rigger X achieved 4 successes on his **Hiding Test**, so the Lone Star driver's **Relocating Test** receives a +4 target modifier in addition to all other appropriate modifiers.

**MULTIPLE VEHICLE COMBAT**
Though the preceding rules work for more than two vehicles, gamemasters may want to group two or more NPC vehicles together if they're cooperating to achieve the same goal (for example, two Lone Star cruisers chasing down a suspected perpetrator). In this case, the gamemaster can make single die rolls for the entire vehicle group. In such cases, use the statistics of the fastest vehicle in the group when determining the **Maneuver Score** and increase the test target number modifier by 1 for each additional vehicle.

**PASSENGER ACTIONS DURING VEHICLE COMBAT**
During vehicle combat, passengers can use vehicle electronics, fire vehicle weapons, hang on or shoot or cast spells at other vehicles. If passengers choose to perform any of these actions, they must account for certain restrictions. Because of the chaotic movements of the vehicle during combat, characters may not always be able to act during all their available phases in a Combat Turn. No character except the rigger may take any offensive action (shooting weapons or casting spells) in a Combat Phase higher than the number of **Driver Points** generated for the vehicle in that turn.

If passengers have Initiative scores higher than the **Driver Points** of the vehicle they are riding in, they simply lose actions. They cannot hold actions until their turn and still get in their full number of attacks. (Being at the mercy of the rigger means being at her mercy. Vehicle passengers ride along with no control over their surroundings.)

Blade is riding shotgun in the Mach 6 next to Rigger X as the two try to give the slip to two Lone Star cruisers. Doing his own little part in discouraging the cops from following so closely, Blade leans out the window to pop a few caps with his Ares Predator.

Blade, who has wired reflexes, rolled an Initiative of 17 for the turn. Normally, he would receive actions in Phases 17 and 7. However, Rigger X generated only 11 **Driver Points** on his **Open Test**. That means no passenger in Rigger X's car can act offensively before Phase 11, so Blade loses his action in Phase 17.

**VEHICLE DAMAGE**
Vehicles receive damage when they are hit by weapons fire and when they collide with objects such as other vehicles, pedestrians, walls and so on.

Vehicle damage is divided into two categories: impact damage from collisions and ramming attacks, and weapons damage (which includes spell damage).

**Condition Monitors** are used to track damage to vehicles in the same manner they are used to track damage to characters. Vehicle damage is categorized by the standard condition levels—Light, Moderate, Serious and Destroyed (Deadly), and vehicles receive target modifiers, Initiative penalties and **Speed Rating** reductions based on their damage status, as shown on the **Vehicle Damage Modifiers Table**.

The damage target modifier applies to all tests that involve the vehicle itself. The Initiative penalty reduces Initiative results generated for the vehicle's driver. The **Speed Rating** reduction reduces the vehicle's **Speed Rating**. Because the vehicle's maximum speed is equal to its **Speed Rating** multiplied by 1.5, this reduction also applies to a vehicle's maximum speed.

**RIGGER DAMAGE**
Whenever a vehicle sustains Serious or Destroyed damage, damage is transferred to the rigger driving the vehicle. In such cases, the controlling rigger must make a **Damage Resistance Test** against 6M Physical damage. If a vehicle is destroyed, the rigger must make a Resistance Test against 6S Physical damage.

**VEHICLE DAMAGE FROM IMPACT**
Impact damage occurs when a vehicle fails a **Crash Test** or is rammed by another vehicle.

The Damage Level of impact damage is based on the vehicle's speed at the time of impact, as shown on the **Impact Damage Levels Table**. For a rammed vehicle (see **Ramming**, p. 47), the Damage Level is based on the difference in speed between the two vehicles.

The Power is equal to the speed divided by 10 and rounded up. When making **Damage Resistance Tests** to resist impact damage, a vehicle's player can use a number of dice equal to the vehicle's **Body Rating**, as well as any available **Control Pool** dice. However, the number of **Control Pool** dice cannot exceed the rigger's **Driving Skill**. The target number for the test equals the Power of the attack. No armor or any other factor reduces the Power of the attack. For every two successes on the test, reduce the Damage Level by one level.

Rigger X's Mach 6 is traveling at 152 meters per turn when it rams Lone Star Cruiser #2, which is traveling at 300 meters per turn. The calculation for the Power of the resulting damage looks like this:

`(300 - 152) / 10 = 14.8, rounded up to 15`

As shown on the **Impact Damage Levels Table**, a collision at 148 meters per turn rates a Damage Level of Serious. Therefore, both the Mach 6 and Cruiser #2 must make tests to resist 15S Damage from the collision.

First, let's look at the Mach 6's test. The Mach 6 has a **Body Rating** of 3, so Rigger X must roll 3 dice against a Base Target Number of 15. However, Rigger X's **Ramming Test** yielded 5 successes, which reduces the damage's Power by 15 (vehicle **Body Rating** x number of successes).

Target numbers cannot be reduced below 2, so the Damage Code is 2S. Rigger X adds 5 dice from his **Control Pool**, so he rolls a total of 8 dice against a Target Number 2. The **Damage Resistance Test** generates 6 successes, which stages the damage down to nothing, and the Mach 6 pulls away with nothing more than a scratch or two.

Now let's look at Cruiser #2. The cruiser was the target of the ramming attempt, so the Damage Code of 15S is not reduced. The cop driving the cruiser is an NPC with a **Professional Rating 2**, so the gamemaster can add 2 dice to the 3 dice for the cruiser's **Body Rating 3**. Rolling 5 dice against a Target Number 15, the gamemaster generates no successes. Consequently, the cruiser takes Serious damage and must now make a **Crash Test**.

**Passengers**
Passengers may incur damage during vehicle collisions even when the vehicle itself escapes damage. Passengers must make the same **Damage Resistance Test** as the vehicle. Apply all vehicle-related Damage Level reductions before making these tests.

If a character is wearing a seat belt or other safety restraint during the collision, stage down the Damage Level an additional level.

If the vehicle is equipped with an **APPS** crash-protection system, reduce the Power of the attack by one half, rounded up.

If the vehicle is equipped with a crash cage, players may add 4 dice to their **Damage Resistance Tests**.

Passengers cannot use **Combat Pool** dice to assist in the test, but **Control Pool** dice used by the rigger in the **Crash Test** also apply to passengers' **Damage Resistance Tests**. Only impact armor protects against crash damage.

The **Damage Resistance Test** for Cruiser #2 didn't stage down the damage, so the two cops riding in the car must make **Damage Resistance Tests**. The initial Damage Code is 15S, but is reduced as follows:

- Cops are wearing seat belts: Reduce Damage Level by one level [15M]
- Cruiser is equipped with **APPS**: Power / 2, rounded up [8M]
- Cops are wearing armor vests (4/3 Rating): Reduce Power by 3 [5M]
- **Final Damage Code**: 5M

The cops have **Body Ratings** of 4, so the gamemaster rolls 4 dice for their **Damage Resistance Tests**. They don't succeed in reducing the damage, and the two Lone Star boys take Moderate damage.

**Crashing**
Crashing is a specific type of impact that usually occurs when the driver or rigger has lost control of a vehicle due to unique circumstances. Specifically, **Crash Tests** are required in the following situations:

- Vehicle takes damage during a ramming action
- Vehicle takes Serious damage in a single attack (including weapon and spell attacks)
- Vehicle's **Condition Monitor** reaches "Destroyed"

The **Crash Test** consists of a **Driving Test** against a base target number equal to the vehicle's **Handling Rating**. All appropriate target modifiers from the **Crash Test Modifiers Table**, p. 52, also apply. Both **Autonav** and **Control Pool** dice may be used for a **Crash Test**. A number of dice equal to the **Autonav Rating** may be used, but the number of **Control Pool** dice used may not exceed the rating of the **Driving Skill** used for the test.

If the test fails, the vehicle crashes. The vehicle comes to a complete stop and the player must make another **Damage Resistance Test** to resist impact damage. (Also see **Passengers**, p. 50.)

Cruiser #2 spins wildly out of control after Rigger X's Mach 6 rams it. Time to see if the Lone Star officer can get this under control before it crashes into the side of a building.

The base target number for the **Crash Test** equals the cruiser's **Handling Rating** of 4, but the following target modifiers apply:

- Cruiser has taken Serious damage: +3
- Cruiser's speed (300 m/turn) exceeds the driver's Reaction Rating x 40: +4
- Driver has taken a Moderate wound: +2
- **Final target number**: 13

The gamemaster rolls 5 dice (3 for the driver's **Car Skill 3** and 2 for his **Professional Rating 2**) for the test. The test produces no successes, however, so the vehicle crashes into the side of a building.

How much more damage can the cruiser withstand? Let's find out.

The cruiser was traveling at 300 meters/turn before it crashed, so the Power for the damage is 300 / 10, or 30 (see **Vehicle Damage from Impact**, p. 50).

Consulting the **Impact Table**, crashing at 300 meters/turn results in a damage level of D. Thus, the Damage Code for the crash damage is 30D.

The gamemaster rolls 3 dice for the cruiser's **Body Rating 3**. (Though the cruiser has an **Armor Rating 6**, this does not apply because armor does not affect collision damage.) Not surprisingly, the test generates no successes, so the cop car bursts into a ball of flames as it slams into the nearest wall.

**COLLIDING WITH OBJECTS**
When vehicles crash, they sometimes collide with other objects, such as walls or pedestrians. Other times, drivers may deliberately ram objects. In either case, the targeted object also takes collision damage.

Individual gamemasters determine exactly which objects crashing vehicles strike, based on the immediate environment, terrain type, time of day and so on.

**Walls and Barriers**
Walls and barriers are the most common objects with which vehicles collide. In some instances, a vehicle collision may cause enough damage to destroy and collapse a structure. Other times, a vehicle will travel right through a barrier, collapsing it and then continuing on its path of destruction.

To determine what happens in such collisions, compare the **Barrier Rating** of the wall/barrier with the vehicle's speed at the time of the collision. (**Barrier Ratings** are listed on p. 98 of SRII.) If the vehicle speed is less than or equal to the **Barrier Rating** multiplied by 20, the vehicle comes to a halt. Use the standard crash rules to resolve vehicle and passenger damage in such cases.

If the vehicle speed is greater than the **Barrier Rating** multiplied by 20, the wall collapses and the vehicle continues traveling through it. The vehicle loses speed after such a collision, however. The speed loss equals the **Barrier Rating** multiplied by 20.

The Power of the collision damage equals the **Barrier Rating** of the wall. Use the loss in speed on the **Impact Damage Levels Table** (p. 50) to determine the Damage Level. If a vehicle breaks through a wall or barrier, passengers do not take damage if they are restrained by some kind of safety gear. Any of the passenger safety gear found in **Passengers** (p. 50) reduce this damage.

Cruiser #2 is traveling 300 meters per turn when it crashes and strikes a factory wall. The wall is Heavy Structural Material with a **Barrier Rating** of 16. The **Barrier Rating** multiplied by 20 equals 320, which exceeds the cruiser's speed. Therefore, the cruiser crumples and comes to a complete stop against the intact wall.

**Vehicle-Pedestrian Collisions**
Whenever a vehicle collides with a person or critter, the pedestrian must make a **Damage Resistance Test** against the impact damage. The Power of the damage is equal to the speed of the vehicle divided by 10, and the Damage Level is one stage higher than that listed on the **Impact Damage Levels Table** for the vehicle speed. (For example, a vehicle moving between 1 and 20 meters per turn would inflict Moderate damage on an unlucky pedestrian.) If the corresponding Damage Level on the **Impact Damage Levels Table** is Destroyed, the Power of the attack increases by half of its original rating, rounded down.

Pedestrians make standard **Damage Resistance Tests** to resist this damage and may use available **Combat Pool** dice on the test. Impact armor reduces the Power of the damage. Do not stage down the Damage Level for critters with hardened armor or characters wearing military-grade armor.

At the same time, the vehicle must also resist damage incurred from hitting the pedestrian. Determine damage as collision damage; the Damage Level is one stage lower than that listed on the **Impact Damage Levels Table** for the vehicle speed. (For example, a vehicle moving between 1 and 20 meters per turn would take no damage from the collision, while one moving between 21 and 60 meters per turn would resist only Light damage.)

It's Saturday night, and Rex Karz and his pals are out joyriding through the sprawl. Rex is having such a good time that he's not paying enough attention to the road, and suddenly his car is making a wide turn—smack into a group of pedestrians standing on the sidewalk.

The car is traveling at 60 meters per turn, so the collision would normally cause Moderate damage according to the **Impact Damage Levels Table**. But this is a vehicle-pedestrian collision, so for the pedestrians the damage is Serious. The Power of the damage is 6 (60 / 10), for a final Damage Code of 6S.

Seems that cars ain't the only things Rex wrecks.

**VEHICLE DAMAGE FROM WEAPONS**
Whenever a player character fires a weapon at a vehicle, he must specify whether he is shooting at the vehicle itself or at passengers inside the vehicle. The process for resolving damage from the attack depends on the character's declared action.

**Attacks Against the Vehicle**
If a character is shooting at the vehicle itself, the weapon's Damage Level is reduced by one level (D to S, S to M, and M to L) to reflect the nature of the vehicle. Weapons with a Light Damage Level cannot affect the vehicle, unless special ammunition is used.

Grenades and other explosives also face the same Damage Level reduction, but anti-vehicle munitions (missiles, rockets, mortar shells and so on) do not.

Vehicle armor reduces the Power of all attacks by its rating, except for anti-vehicle (AV) munitions. If a weapon's standard Power (unaugmented by burst or full-auto fire rates) does not exceed the armor's rating, the weapons fire does no damage to the vehicle.

Against **AV munitions** (weapons using a shaped-charged, explosively-formed penetrating warhead specifically designed to take out vehicles), their Damage Level is not reduced. The Power of the **AV munitions** is only reduced by half the **Armor Rating** (round down the **Armor Rating** before calculating the **AV munitions** Power).

To resist the damage, the vehicle's controlling player makes a **Damage Resistance Test** for the vehicle. He rolls a number of dice equal to the vehicle's **Body Rating** and may add any available **Control Pool** dice. The number of **Control Pool** dice added may not exceed the character's **Driving Skill** rating. The test target number equals the modified Power of the weapons attack.

Compare the number of successes generated by both the attacker and the vehicle and determine the damage. Standard staging rules apply. If the attack does no damage and the number of **Control Pool** dice exceeds the attacker's successes, the attack is a complete miss.

Whenever a vehicle sustains Serious damage from a single attack, the driver must make a **Crash Test** (see **Crashing**, p. 51). When all the boxes on a vehicle's **Condition Monitor** are filled, the vehicle automatically crashes.

If a vehicle has a **Body Rating** of 0 (as in the case of very small drones), any success generated by the attacker automatically destroys the vehicle.

**Called Shots and External Components**
To fire at a vehicle's external components (such as a tire, antenna or vehicle weapon), a character must make a **Called Shot** against the component. Do not change the Damage Code of the attack (the standard effect of staging up a **Called Shot** is negated by the vehicle's Damage Level reduction). Note that certain components, such as external fuel tanks, may have separate Body and Armor ratings.

Normally, the attack must cause Moderate or higher damage to the vehicle to destroy an external component. However, the gamemaster may reduce this damage threshold to Light for fragile components, such as antennas, or increase it to Serious for reinforced ones, such as weapon turrets.

**Optional Terrain-Based Control Pool Dice Limits**
The use of **Control Pool** dice on vehicle **Damage Resistance Tests** simulates a driver's ability to maneuver his vehicle to reduce the damage it takes from an attack.

If desired, gamemasters can take this one step farther and apply the following terrain-based limits on **Control Pool** dice in their games. These limits apply to **Damage Resistance Tests** and reflect the various degrees of maneuverability afforded by different terrain.

| Tight             | Character's Driving Skill + 3 (round up)      |

**ATTACKS AGAINST PASSENGERS**
If a character is shooting at passengers inside a vehicle, the passengers receive the benefit of protection from the vehicle. Subtract either the vehicle's **Armor** or **Body Rating**, whichever is higher, from the Power of the attack. Do not reduce the Damage Level of the weapon, however. Passengers cannot use **Combat Pool** dice to assist in their **Damage Resistance Tests**.

A targeted rigger who is jacked into a vehicle receives a +3 target modifier on his **Damage Resistance Tests**. (A rigger's consciousness is not focused on his body while he is jacked in.)

Any passenger attack with a Deadly Damage Level also inflicts Light damage against the vehicle. The damage occurs at the same time as the attack on the passenger and cannot be resisted.

**VEHICLES AND MAGIC**
Only physical spells, which produce physical effects, affect vehicles. Mana spells do not affect vehicles, even if they are being controlled by the living mind of a rigger. Likewise, mana spells have no effect on a rigger jacked into a vehicle, unless the casting magician can actually see the rigger. See **Spells against Characters in Vehicles**, p. 54.

Spells cast against vehicles have a Target Number of 8, due to the complex technological and electronic nature of a vehicle. The vehicle's driver makes a normal **Damage Resistance Test** for the vehicle, using the vehicle's Body. The target number for the **Damage Resistance Test** equals the spell's Force modified by armor. Magicians can allocate spell defense dice to protect a vehicle against such attacks.

If the casting magician's **Spell Success Test** generates more successes than the vehicle's **Spell Resistance Test**, the spell takes effect.

Vehicles are single, complete entities. A vehicle's wheels, windshield, antenna and other accessories are interrelated components. Therefore, magicians cannot use magic to target individual portions of a vehicle. A single-target combat spell affects the entire targeted vehicle and all of its components and accessories. An area-effect spell affects the entire targeted vehicle, as well as its passengers and cargo.

**DAMAGING MANIPULATION SPELLS**
Damaging manipulation spells create a physical effect, then throw the manifestation of that effect around an area in a random, unfocused manner. If compared to mundane weapons, damaging manipulations function like standard high explosives, rather than like anti-vehicle munitions, which direct the energy in a focused manner to penetrate vehicle armor and mass bulk.

Damaging manipulation spells, therefore, are treated as normal weapons. Stage down the Damage Level by one step (D to S, S to M and so on), and reduce the Force (or Power) of the spell by the vehicle's **Armor Rating**. Unfortunately for the magician, this means that the spell may have no effect even before it leaves his or her hands.

**COMBAT SPELLS**
Combat spells, on the other hand, by their very intent, do target the vehicle and so are treated as anti-vehicle weapons. They do not suffer the same reduction in Power Level as damaging manipulation spells. In addition, since a combat spell attacks a vehicle from the inside out, and thus bypasses the normal routes of attack, the Force (or Power) of the spell is reduced by only half the **Armor Rating** (because a combat spell's attack is through the vehicle's aura, and since armor is an integral part of the vehicle, armor does have a limited effect).

In other words, do not reduce the Damage Level of damage from a combat spell, and only reduce the Force (or Power) of the spell by half the vehicle armor, rounded down.

Because of their "inside-out" nature, combat spells will always cause damage even if the vehicle's armor would reduce the spell's force to 0. For example, if the **Armor Rating** is greater than twice the Force of the spell, the player must still make a **Spell Resistance Test** for the vehicle against a Target Number of 2 (**Armor** 4 / 2 = 2, and the Force of the spell is 2). Of course, if the Force of the spell is reduced to 1, the target number for the **Spell Resistance Test** would still be 2.

**SPELLS AGAINST CHARACTERS IN VEHICLES**
Magicians can use spells to selectively target passengers or drivers of vehicles, provided that the magician has a clear line of sight to his target. Motorcycle riders and drivers or passengers in other open or open-topped vehicles are examples of vulnerable targets. Similarly, any object that is not a part of the vehicle and is visible can be targeted with a spell.

Drivers and passengers who are enclosed completely inside a vehicle cannot be targeted with spells, because the vehicle obscures them. A spell, other than a damaging manipulation spell, will not work unless the caster has a direct line of sight to his target; merely knowing someone is inside is not good enough. Nearly every vehicle in the 2050s comes with adjustable tinted windows, which allow the driver and passengers a full unrestricted view out of the vehicle, while blocking anyone outside from seeing in. This means a magician riding in a vehicle can cast spells through the windows at targets outside, while remaining protected from spells.

Nick Nightmare is roaring through the Seattle night on his Aurora racing bike, with visions of barely legal debauchery in his tiny mind. Unknown to Nick, a wiz-kid mage has erected a barrier spell in Nick's path, and Nick races blindly into it.

What happens next depends on what type of barrier spell the mage has cast. If it's a physical barrier spell, both Nick and his Aurora crash into the barrier. Resolve damage as if Nick had crashed his motorbike into a wall.

If the wiz kid casts a mana barrier spell, strange things occur. The Aurora is an inanimate object, so the spell does not affect it, and it races on into the night unimpeded. Nick, on the other hand, is alive (at the time of impact, anyway) and hits the mana barrier just as if he hit a wall. Nick flies backward off his motorbike and takes damage as if he had hit a wall with a **Barrier Rating** equal to the spell's Force.

Now, suppose Nick was driving a Eurocar Westwind 2000. If the wiz kid casts a mana barrier spell, Nick and the vehicle drive through without a scratch. In this case, the aura of the sports car encloses and obscures Nick from the wiz kid's line of sight, so the mana barrier has no effect on Nick.

Of course, a magician outside an enclosed vehicle can get around the line-of-sight problem by blowing out the vehicle's windows (or having his hired guns do so). Even so, this may not completely solve the problem—it may fail to provide a sight line or provide only a limited sight line that produces a +4 Partial Cover target modifier for the **Spell Test**.

Individual gamemasters determine the exact effects of blowing out vehicle windows in such cases. As a rule of thumb, blowing out the windows of cars, trucks, buses and most other ground vehicles provides unimpeded lines of sight to characters inside the vehicle. Blowing out the windows of campers or other vehicles with limited window space provides limited lines of sight; in these cases, the +4 Partial Cover modifier applies. The visual slits of an armored car are too small for anyone on the outside to look in, so blowing out the protective glass is a waste of ammunition. And finally, most armored personnel carriers use electronic cameras or reflective periscopes—so they have no windows to blow out!

**VEHICLES AND NATURAL DOMAINS**
Vehicle drivers and passengers are considered to be in the same natural domain as that of the vehicle in which they are traveling. Therefore, they are equally vulnerable to the powers of a nature spirit as the vehicle itself. Shamans do not need lines of sight to command nature spirits to use their powers against passengers inside a vehicle, provided that both the shaman and the vehicle are in the spirit's domain. If a shaman leaves the spirit's domain, she forfeits any remaining services the spirit owes her (though the spirit will continue to carry out the last command given it). Likewise, if the vehicle leaves the spirit's domain, the spirit can no longer act against the vehicle or its passengers, unless it is a great nature spirit or a toxic nature spirit (both of which are capable of crossing domains).

Tricky, a Raccoon shaman, is fleeing on her motorbike from a couple of gangers chasing her in a Ford Americar. Making a sharp hairpin curve at King Street, she makes another hairpin turn and turns into a blind alley. The gangers miss her second hairpin turn and go roaring on down King Street. Tricky knows the gangers will double back as soon as they realize their mistake, so she decides to call for some help and summons a city spirit.

Both Tricky and the gangers are on the city streets, which puts them within the domain of the city spirit, so Tricky orders the spirit to use its Fear power on the gangers. Though Tricky can't see the gangers and has no idea where they are, as long as they're out on the streets the spirit will find them. Being inside the car is no help, because the car is still within the domain of the city. However, if Tricky decides to take a shortcut through a building (a Hearth domain), she can no longer order the spirit to act against the vehicle or its occupants.

Similarly, if the gangers decide to take a shortcut through the city park (a Forest domain), Tricky cannot command the city spirit to act against them while they remain inside the park.

**CASTING MAGIC FROM VEHICLES**
The continually shifting motion of a moving vehicle makes it difficult for a magician to achieve and maintain lines of sight to targets outside a moving vehicle.

To reflect this difficulty, add the following additional modifiers to **Spell Tests** made by magicians attempting to cast spells from moving vehicles against characters or objects outside the vehicle.

**ASTRAL PROJECTION FROM VEHICLES**
Though magicians can easily project while their meat bodies are in motion, they may have problems returning to their bodies. Unless the magician knows the vehicle's destination or travel route, he will have to search for his physical shell (p. 146, SRII). And even if the magician knows the vehicle's travel route, returning to his shell will take some time, and re-integrating his astral and physical bodies is very difficult if his physical body is still in motion.

Therefore, a moving magician must make an **Intelligence (8) Test** to return to his body. If the test succeeds, the magician returns to his physical body. If not, the astral form misses the physical, and the magician must try again.

Remember that a character's normal movement speed in astral space is his **Astral Quickness Rating** multiplied by 4. In many instances, vehicles in the physical world can easily outpace astral movement speeds, so magicians generally cannot follow vehicles from astral space. (To do so, a mage would have to resort to his fast movement rate, and at that rate magicians cannot see in sufficient detail to follow anything closely.)

### VEHICLE GUNNERY

The vehicle gunnery rules are used to resolve fire from all vehicle-mounted weapons, whether the weapons are being fired by gunners, by riggers jacked into vehicles or controlling drones, or by self-operating drones. Manual gunnery rules apply when characters fire vehicle weapons without the aid of sensors. Sensor-enhanced gunnery rules apply when a vehicle's sensors are used to aim vehicle weapons.

This section also provides rules for missiles and indirect-fire attacks.

**MANUAL GUNNERY**
Manual gunnery rules apply whenever characters fire personal or vehicle weapons without the aid of sensors. (Note that riggers jacked into vehicles may use the manual gunnery rules to fire vehicle weapons.)

Though a manually aimed weapon may not be as accurate as a sensor-aimed weapon, the manual aiming method does not increase the firing vehicle's **Signature** as does the sensor-aiming method, and is not susceptible to **ECM** and **ED**.

Whenever a character manually aims and fires a weapon, the player makes a **Manual Gunnery Test**. Standard Ranged Combat rules apply (pp. 87-92, SRII). However, the target number modifiers listed in the **Manual Gunnery Modifiers Table**, p. 57, replace the standard Ranged Combat modifiers (p. 89, SRII).

**MANUAL GUNNERY MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**

**Smartlink**: Smartlink modifiers apply only if both the gunner and the vehicle weapon are outfitted with smartlink hardware. **Smartlink Level I** is the default smartlink found in SRII. **Smartlink Level II** is described in the **Fields of Fire** sourcebook and operates under special rules and certain conditions (see pp. 84-85, **Fields of Fire**).

**Recoil Compensation**: In addition to any recoil compensation provided by recoil-compensation accessories fitted to a weapon, vehicle weapon-mounts also provide recoil compensation. Pintle mounts grant -2 recoil compensation; ring mounts grant -6 recoil compensation. For weapons mounted on fixed mounts and turrets, reduce recoil by half (rounded down) before applying recoil compensation provided by weapon accessories. (Note that this compensation cancels out the double-uncompensated recoil modifier for heavy weapons (p. 89, SRII)). See also **Vehicle Weapon Mounts**, page 131.

**Firing Unmounted Weapons**: A +2 modifier applies if a character in a vehicle is firing a weapon that is not mounted in a vehicle mount. A common example of this is a passenger leaning out of a window firing a handgun.

**Attacking Drone Walking/Running**: These modifiers apply only if the drone is propelling itself with mechanical legs.

**Relative Motion**: If the attacker and target are moving toward each other (or one is overtaking the other) reduce the Motion modifier by 1. If the attacker and target are moving away from each other (or one is outrunning the other), increase the modifier by 1. Note that the **Relative Motion** modifier may not apply if both attacker and target are moving at roughly equivalent speeds. If the attacker and target are moving along the same axis of travel, the modifier does not apply. If the attacker and target are moving at right angles to each other, however, it does.

**Attacking Vehicle Damaged**: If the attacking vehicle is damaged, apply the appropriate damage modifier, based on the Damage Level on the **Vehicle Condition Monitor**. Vehicle damage modifiers are cumulative with character damage modifiers for Physical or Stun Damage. (See Vehicle Damage, p. 49.)

### VEHICLE GUNNERY

**MANUAL GUNNERY MODIFIERS TABLE KEY** (Continued)
**Attacking Vehicle Damaged**: If the attacking vehicle is damaged, apply the appropriate damage modifier, based on the Damage Level on the **Vehicle Condition Monitor**. Vehicle damage modifiers are cumulative with character damage modifiers for Physical or Stun Damage. (See **Vehicle Damage**, p. 49.)

**Relative Speed**: To determine the **Relative Speed** modifier for a weapon attack, compare the speeds of the attacker and target. If either vehicle's speed is less than 5 meters per turn, round the speed up to 5; if both attacker and target are moving at speeds less than 5 meters per turn, treat the attack as standard Ranged Combat.

**SENSOR-ENHANCED GUNNERY**
Sensor-enhanced gunnery makes use of the vehicle's sensors to improve the aiming of vehicle weapons. Though sensor-enhanced aiming produces more accurate fire than manual aiming, sensor-enhanced gunnery is susceptible to **ECM** and **ED**. Sensor-enhanced gunnery is also the aiming method used by drones that are not directly controlled by a rigger.

To use sensor-enhanced gunnery, the attacking vehicle or drone must first make a successful **Sensor Test** to detect the target with its sensors (see **Sensor Test**, p. 28). One success on the **Sensor Test** is enough for a weapons lock. Making a **Sensor Test** constitutes a Complex Action.

After the weapon has locked on to the target, the attacking player makes a **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test**. The player rolls a number of dice equal to the character's **Gunnery Skill** plus half the vehicle's **Sensor Rating** (round down). **Combat Pool** dice may be added as well. Drones, when not controlled by a rigger, use their **Pilot Rating** in place of the **Gunnery Skill**.

The test target number is equal to the target's **Signature**, modified by the appropriate target modifiers from the **Sensor-Enhanced Targeting Modifiers Table**. Making a **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test** constitutes a Complex Action.

If the attacking vehicle's sensors cannot lock onto the target for any reason, the attacker may not make a sensor-enhanced gunnery attack.

**SENSOR-ENHANCED TARGETING MODIFIERS TABLE KEY**
**Urban Environment**: This modifier applies when combat occurs in a major industrial area, such as a large city, industrial plant or other non-residential area of a sprawl.

**Direct LOS**: The **Direct LOS** modifier applies only if a clear, continuous straight line can be traced between the gunner and the target, with nothing blocking the view. This generally occurs only in ground-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. For ground-to-ground attacks, this modifier applies only when the target is sitting in clear, open terrain.

**Interrupted LOS**: The **Interrupted LOS** modifier applies to most ground-to-ground attacks. In this case, a number of things (smoke, foliage, trash dumpsters) may block the line of sight between the attacker and target.

**ECM/ECCM in use**: **ECM** modifiers increase the **Gunnery Test** target number by the number of successes the jammer has generated on his **Electronic Warfare Test**. **ECCM** modifiers counteract **ECM** successes and also require an **Electronic Warfare Test**. **ECM** and **ECCM** modifiers apply only if the attacking vehicle is inside an **ECM** field other than its own. See **Electronic Countermeasures**, p. 31.

**ED/ECD in use**: **ED** modifiers increase the **Gunnery Test** target number by the number of successes the deceiver has generated on his **Electronic Warfare Test**. **ECD** modifiers counteract **ED** successes and also require an **Electronic Warfare Test**. See **Electronic Deception**, p. 32.

**Recoil Compensation**: In addition to any recoil compensation provided by recoil-compensation accessories fitted to a weapon, vehicle weapon-mounts also provide recoil compensation. Pintle mounts grant -2 recoil compensation; ring mounts grant -6 recoil compensation. For weapons mounted on fixed mounts and turrets, reduce recoil by half (round down) before applying recoil compensation provided by weapon accessories. (Note that this compensation cancels out the double-uncompensated recoil modifier for heavy weapons (p. 89, SRII)). See also **Vehicle Weapon Mounts**, page 131.

**Attacking Vehicle Damaged**: If the attacking vehicle is damaged, apply the appropriate damage modifier, based on the Damage Level on the **Vehicle Condition Monitor**. Vehicle damage modifiers are cumulative with character damage modifiers for Physical or Stun Damage. (See **Vehicle Damage**, p. 49.)

Steeler (**Gunnery 4**) is rigged into the Airstorm (a t-bird with **Sensor Rating 3** and a turret-mounted heavy machine gun) and is providing air support for a column of merc armored vehicles. As he clears the crest of a hill, his sensors detect a Striker light tank patrolling the road ahead. Steeler decides it's time for the Airstorm to pour some lead rain on the tank's parade, so he makes a **Sensor Test** to lock on to the tank.

The test succeeds, so Steeler decides to use sensor-enhanced gunnery against the Striker tank. The base target number for the **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test** is 3 (the targeted tank's **Signature**). If we momentarily ignore modifiers for recoil, the target number receives a -3 modifier because the Airstorm has a direct line of sight to the target. That produces a result of 0, which is rounded up to 2 because no target number can be less than 2. Steeler's player rolls 5 dice for the test—4 for Steeler's **Gunnery Skill Rating** of 4, plus 1 for the Airstorm's **Sensor Rating** (3 / 2 = 1.5, which rounds down to 1).

Meanwhile, on the ground, Sgt. Juan, one of the mercs Steeler is supporting, detects the Striker on his vehicle's sensors and decides that Steeler shouldn't have all the fun. Sgt. Juan must make his **Gunnery Test** against a Target Number 3, however; he doesn't receive the line-of-sight modifier because ground clutter and intervening terrain features partially obscure the Striker from the sensors on Sgt. Juan's vehicles.

**MISSILE COMBAT**
Missile fire follows slightly different rules than standard sensor-enhanced gunnery, because missiles have their own smart circuitry that allows them to alter their trajectories in mid-flight (and slightly slows their flight times).

Before firing a missile at a target, the attacker must first detect and lock on to the target with his vehicle's sensors using a **Sensor Test** (p. 28). If the vehicle's sensors do not detect the target, missile fire will not strike it. One success on the **Sensor Test** indicates a lock.

After locking on to the target, the attacker makes a **Missile Attack Test** using a number of dice equal to the character's **Gunnery Skill Rating**, plus the missile's **Intelligence Rating**. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the **Sensor-Enhanced Targeting Modifiers Table** on page 58. **ECM** modifiers apply if the missile passes through **ECM** fields during any part of its flight.

Unlike bullets and other small projectiles, missiles do not travel at near-instantaneous speeds. All missiles reach their targets at the end of the Combat Turn (i.e., Combat Phase 0, after all players have completed all their actions), regardless of the Combat Phase in which the missile is launched. Characters firing missiles make their **Enhanced Gunnery Tests** during Combat Phase 0. Use standard damage rules to resolve missile damage to living creatures. For missile damage to vehicles and inanimate structures, use the rules in **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**, page 53.

Note that the following missile-combat rules apply to missiles only. Rocket attacks are resolved with **Manual Gunnery** or **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery** rules because rockets do not have **Intelligence Ratings**.

**MISSILE FIRE MODES**
Missiles may be fired in "continuous lock" mode or "fire-and-forget" mode. Continuous lock mode requires the gunner to maintain a positive lock on the target during the missile's flight. Fire-and-forget requires a target lock only at the missile's launch.

**Continuous Lock Mode**
Continuous lock mode improves the chances of a hit but restricts the firing vehicle's maneuverability, because the rigger must maintain sensor contact with the target at all times. Additionally, the rigger cannot attack other targets until the missile strikes at the end of the Combat Turn.

If a gunner chooses to fire a missile in continuous lock mode, he may add half the **Sensor Rating** of his vehicle (rounded down) to the missile's **Intelligence Rating**. However, all other **Driving Tests** made during the turn receive a +2 target modifier.

**Fire-and-Forget Mode**
The fire-and-forget mode allows an attacker to fire at other targets during the turn of the missile launch and to continue to maneuver his vehicle without restriction. When firing a missile in this mode, the attacker needs to establish a target lock only at the time of firing. However, the attacker cannot add Sensor dice to the missile's Intelligence.

**INDIRECT FIRE**
The indirect fire rule allows a drone, vehicle or shadowrunner on the ground to acquire a target lock for a weapon that is in a different location. This enables a weapon to fire on a target when it does not have line of sight to or a sensor lock on the target.

The indirect fire rule may be used with drones, mortars and Ballista missile launchers (see **Fields of Fire**), and other general artillery weapons.

To use indirect fire, the spotter, weapon and rigger's remote control deck must be equipped with the **BattleTac Fire Direction Data Manager (FDDM)** (see **New Toys**, p. 136). Spotters can also use other target designator devices such as laser sights and laser, microwave and radar designators to lock on to targets for indirect fire. (For more information on these devices, see p. 60, **Fields of Fire**.)

Additionally, characters may take the new **Indirect Fire Concentration** of the **Gunnery Skill** to increase their effectiveness as spotters.

Resolving indirect fire is a two-step process. First, the spotter (not the rigger or character who is firing the actual weapon) makes an **Indirect Fire Test** to lock on to the target. If the spotter does not have the **Indirect Fire Concentration**, he may use his **Gunnery Skill**, but the test suffers a +2 target modifier.

The spotter rolls a number of dice equal to his **Indirect Fire Concentration** (or **Gunnery Skill Rating**), plus half the **Sensor Rating** of the missile (rounded down), plus the missile's **Intelligence Rating**. The test target number is equal to the target's **Signature Rating**. The spotter may not use **Combat Pool** dice for the test, but gamemasters may manipulate the target number to reflect the spotting device and weather conditions. See the **Visibility Table** (p. 89, SRII) for sample modifiers.

If the **Indirect Fire Test** fails, the missile cannot be launched against the target. However, the missile may be used for an area-effect attack (see **Area-Effect Attacks**). In any case, the test constitutes a Complex Action.

After the missile is launched, the spotter must keep the sensor or target designator locked on to the target until the missile strikes at the end of the Combat Turn. During the turn, the spotter receives a +2 modifier to all other Success Tests. If the spotter loses contact with the target, the missile scatters (see **Area-Effect Attacks**). Characters using a target designator may attack with another weapon, but they suffer the **Second Firearm** modifier when doing so (see p. 90, SRII).

The second part of the indirect-fire process consists of a standard **Missile Attack Test** made by the attacking player (not the spotting player). Apply all appropriate modifiers from the **Sensor-Enhanced Targeting Modifiers Table** (p. 58). **ECM** modifiers apply if the missile passes through **ECM** fields during any part of its flight.

**Combat Pool** dice cannot be used on the **Missile Attack Test**, but the attacker can add a number of dice equal to the number of successes generated on the spotter's **Indirect Fire Test**.

Molyneaux is a forward observer for a shadowrun team making a run against a corporate research park. As the team exits a building in the park, Moly spots a corporate armored transport moving in to cut off his advance. Moly radios the team rigger, Tubbs, and requests some fire support. Tubbs tells Moly to paint him a target.

Moly pulls out a laser designator and points it at the transport. To see if Moly gets a lock on the armored transport, Moly's player rolls 6 dice (5 for Moly's **Indirect Fire Skill Rating** of 5 and 1 for the **Sensor Rating** of the anti-vehicle missile), against a Target Number 3 (the targeted armored transport has a **Signature** of 3).

Moly's **Indirect Fire Test** generates 3 successes, so the target lock is achieved.

Tubbs immediately fires a laser-guided anti-vehicle missile. To resolve the attack, Tubbs' player makes a **Missile Attack Test**. The player rolls 13 dice (6 for Tubbs **Gunnery Skill Rating** of 6, 4 for the missile's **Intelligence Rating** of 4, and 3 for the 3 successes from Moly's **Indirect Fire Test**.) The Target Number for the test is 6, reflecting the Citymaster's improved **Signature**.

**Area-Effect Attacks**
Area-effect missile attacks occur in the following circumstances:

- The spotter's **Indirect Fire Attack Test** fails and he cannot lock on to the target.
- The spotter cannot maintain the target lock until Phase 0 of the turn.
- The desired targets are spread over a wide area and no single vehicle is targeted.
- The targeted object or area has no **Signature**.
- The attack is made without a target designator.

Target numbers for **Area-Effect Tests** are listed in the **Area-Effect Target Numbers Table**, p. 61. If no target designator is used to guide the missile, use the appropriate target number from the **Vehicle Sensor Only** row.

If the area-effect attack occurred because the spotter's target lock was interrupted after the spotter made a successful **Indirect Fire Test**, calculate the target number as if the spotter had used a radio target designator. Successes generated on the **Indirect Fire Test** may not be used in the **Missile Attack Test** for damage in such cases.

Indirect area-effect missile attacks always scatter. The scatter distance is determined by the range between the spotter's designator or the vehicle sensor and the target, as shown on the **Remote Gunnery Scatter Table**, p. 61. To determine the exact scatter, the player firing the missile makes a **Gunnery Test**. **Combat Pool** dice may be used on the test, but **Sensor** and Missile **Intelligence** dice may not. Each success generated on this test reduces the scatter distance. For short- and medium-range targets, each success reduces the scatter by 4 meters. For long- and extreme-range targets, each success reduces the scatter by 15 meters. If the final scatter result is 0 meters or less, the missiles strike the target directly.

Determine scatter direction with the standard **Scatter diagram** (p. 97, SRII).

Use standard damage rules to resolve missile damage to living creatures. For missile damage to vehicles and inanimate structures, use the rules in **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**, page 53.

As the anti-vehicle missile takes out the transport, a burst of gunfire from the left draws Moly's attention to a squad of corporate troops advancing on his team from 250 meters away. Molyneaux radios Tubbs again and asks for an anti-personnel missile this time.

Rather than locking on to one of the corporate troopers in the group, Moly decides to target the squad's center of mass. With Moly's laser designator, the troops are at short range (Target Number 4). Tubbs's player then makes a **Gunnery Test** to fire the missile. The test generates only 3 successes.

The gamemaster determines the scatter (2D6 x 2), which comes out to 16 meters. However, Tubbs's **Gunnery Test** generated 3 successes, so he can reduce the scatter by 3 x 4 meters, or 12 meters. That means the missiles strike 4 meters away from the squad's center of mass.

**SIGNATURE**
A vehicle's **Signature Rating** indicates the vehicle's vulnerability to electromagnetic or thermal detection and its ability to evade or "fool" smart weapons.

The **Signature Rating** of a vehicle is used as the target number for all attacks made against the vehicle with all "smart weapon" systems and sensor-enhanced weapons. Smart weapons are missiles and vehicle weapons that are guided by a vehicle's sensors.

Because vehicle sensor systems include imaging and tracking devices that compensate for variables such as range, target and attacker's motion, most standard target modifiers do not apply. However, sensors are vulnerable to electrical interference, electronic countermeasures and other factors, so target modifiers related to these factors do apply. Applicable modifiers are listed on the **Sensor-Enhanced Targeting Modifiers Table** (p. 58).

**Signature Ratings** for vehicles are provided in the **Vehicle List** (p. 148).

**SIGNATURES OF BIOLOGICAL FORMS**
The base **Signature Rating** for humans and metahumans is 6. Gamemasters may determine the Signatures of critters based on their sizes. As a general rule, a critter that is three times larger than a human has a **Signature** of 5. A critter that is six times larger than a human has a **Signature** of 4, and so on. Similarly, a critter that is three times smaller than a human has a **Signature** of 7; a critter that is six times smaller, a **Signature** of 8 and so on.

Targets with high Signatures are more difficult to hit. Targets with lower Signatures can be hit more easily.

Signatures for some common critters are listed on the **Critter Signature Ratings Table**.

### DRONES

Riggers can control unmanned vehicles (known as drones) via remote control networks. Additionally, riggers can use remote control networks to control robots—drones equipped with mechanical arms, legs and other specialized appendages. This section provides rules for using drones and remote control networks.

Remote control networks also enable riggers to control building security systems. Rules for this use of remote control networks are provided in **The Security Rigger** (p. 77).

**REMOTE CONTROL NETWORKS**
A remote control network consists of two fundamental elements: a remote control (**RC**) deck and drones. The **RC** deck is the central control station, from which the rigger monitors and directs the movements of drones connected to the network. The **RC** deck also maintains the electronic integrity of the network by ensuring stable data flow and employing active countermeasures to keep out unwanted intruders.

Because of the vast amount of data being transmitted over the airwaves, remote control networks actually use three separate radio channels to command and control drones: the command, simsense and system channels. For more information about how these channels operate, see **Electronic Warfare**, p. 68.

**SUBSCRIBER LISTS**
An **RC** deck's subscriber list is a file that enables the deck to identify all the drones under its control. Only drones listed on an **RC** deck's subscriber list can connect with the deck. This helps protect the network from unwanted intruders who may attempt to intercept network communications and feed it false information or even seize control of the system (see **Signal Interception**, p. 68).

A subscriber list can contain a number of drones equal to twice the **RC** deck's rating. However, a deck can actively control only a number of drones equal to its rating. All network drones operate under affiliated or non-affiliated status. Any drone that is under the direct control of an **RC** deck is affiliated with that deck. Affiliated drones can receive commands from the remote control deck and transmit data to it and to other affiliated drones.

A non-affiliated drone is operating independently of the **RC** deck. Consequently, a rigger controlling a network can neither see through nor control the non-affiliated drone. Additionally, the non-affiliated drone cannot communicate with any other drones in the network.

The act of affiliating or disaffiliating a drone requires a Simple Action. Therefore, substituting a non-affiliated drone for an affiliated drone requires 2 Simple Actions or a single Complex Action (1 Simple Action for disaffiliating the first drone and 1 for affiliating its substitute). A drone may not act during the Combat Turn in which it is being affiliated.

Josie Cruise has a **Rating 4** remote control deck. The deck's subscriber list can hold transmission information for up to eight drones, but the deck enables Josie to actively control only four at any one time. Josie has six subscriber drones on her list: her command van, an aerial surveillance drone, two armed aerial spotters and two armed ground patrol vehicles (**GPVs**).

Currently, Josie is performing reconnaissance for her shadowrunner team. She's affiliated her command van, the surveillance drone and the two aerial spotters, which gives her team considerable aerial coverage. As the team makes its way into the main factory, one of the spotters detects a security response team bearing down on the runners. Josie decides to engage the security forces with some suppressive fire and buy her teammates a little more time. Rolling for Initiative, she generates a 19, which gives her two actions for the Combat Turn. She spends her first Simple Action disaffiliating her surveillance drone in favor of a **GPV**. She spends her second Simple Action affiliating the **GPV**, so she will be able to use the **GPV** during her next Combat Phase.

**HARDWIRING A REMOTE CONTROL DECK**
Hardwiring a remote control deck to a vehicle is the act of permanently affiliating the two components. Hardwiring a deck and vehicle provides three main benefits. First, a hardwired deck can draw power from the vehicle's alternator or battery to augment its internal power source. Second, a hardwired configuration provides the rigger with the protective benefits of the vehicle while she is jacked into the remote control network, and enables the driver to run the vehicle while jacked into the **RC** deck. Finally, a hardwired remote deck can increase its **Flux Rating** by half the vehicle's **Body Rating**, rounded down.

Vehicles must be adapted for rigger control and equipped with electronics ports (see **Electronics Port**, p. 139) before they can be hardwired to remote decks. Vehicles that are hardwired to decks cannot be disaffiliated.

See **Vehicle Design and Customization**, p. 126, for more information on adding a remote control deck to a vehicle.

**DUMP SHOCK**
Because vehicle control rig jacks are connected to riggers' middle brains, the effects of dump shock on riggers can be considerably more serious than the effects of dump shock on a decker.

Any time a rigger is dumped from a remote control network, the following three conditions occur:

- The rigger must overcome the normal effects of disorientation for 10 Combat Turns.
- During the 10 turns, all of the rigger's **Success Tests** receive a +2 modifier.
- The rigger must also resist (**RC** deck Rating + 4)S Stun damage from neural biofeedback.

A rigger can reduce the duration of these disorienting effects by making a **Willpower Test** against a Target Number 4. Divide the number of successes into 30 (round up) to determine the number of seconds she is disoriented, then divide that product by 3 (round up) to determine the number of Combat Turns the effects last.

**ACTIONS**
The following list describes possible actions a rigger can perform using a remote control deck.

**FREE ACTIONS**
- **Activate/Deactivate Sensors**: A rigger may activate or deactivate sensors for a single drone. Activated sensors come on at the start of the next Combat Turn.
- **Activate/Deactivate ECM/ECCM**: A rigger may activate or deactivate **ECM** or **ECCM** for a single drone. Activated **ECM/ECCM** comes online at the start of the next Combat Turn.
- **Arm/Disarm a Weapon System**: A rigger may order a single drone to arm or disarm one of its weapon systems. Note that a drone may have only one weapon system armed at any one time. However, switching weapon systems only requires one Free Action.
- **Delay Action**: Per standard combat rules.
- **Call up a Status Report**: A rigger may monitor the position, heading and speed, damage report, and/or current orders of a single drone.
- **Observe**: A rigger may casually observe through one drone. If the rigger is in captain's chair mode (p. 65), he may do so through any drone on his subscriber list. If the rigger is "jumped" into a drone—meaning that he is seeing and hearing primarily through that drone's systems—he may observe through that primary drone only. This action is the same as the standard Action Observe (p. 81, SRII). If a rigger has jumped into a primary drone, observing through a secondary drone requires a Complex Action (see **Operative Modes**, p. 65).
- **Speak a Word**: Per standard combat rules.

**SIMPLE ACTIONS**
- **Affiliate/Disaffiliate a Drone**: A rigger may add or drop a drone from the deck's active management.
- **Observe in Detail**: A rigger may observe in detail (see p. 81, SRII) through any single drone while in captain's chair mode. While jumped into a drone, a rigger can do this with the primary drone only.
- **Perform the Same Free Action on Multiple Drones**: A rigger may perform one Free Action with two or more drones simultaneously while in captain's chair mode. However, he cannot perform two or more separate Free Actions.
- **Jump into a Primary Drone**: A rigger takes direct control of one drone (see **Operative Modes**).
- **Return to Captain's Chair**: A rigger stops maintaining direct control of one drone and returns to monitoring the overall status of all drones. (See **Operative Modes**.)

**COMPLEX ACTIONS**
- **Conduct Signal Interception**: A rigger may attempt to wage electronic warfare against a remote control network. For more information, see **Signal Interception**, page 68.
- **Conduct MIJI**: A rigger may attempt to engage in advanced electronic warfare using one of four possible methods: meaconing, intrusion, jamming or interference. For more information, see **MIJI**, page 69.
- **Fire a Weapon System**: A rigger may fire an armed weapon on any single drone. (See **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery**, p. 58.) If the rigger is directly controlling a primary drone, he cannot perform this action with a secondary drone. Riggers operating through a cybernetic link can use their **Combat Pool** only with the primary drone. See **Operative Modes**.
- **Issue a Command**: A rigger may issue a command to a drone or a group of drones. See **Issuing Commands**, page 66.
- **Intercept a Remote Control Channel**: The rigger may search the airwaves for a remote control channel being used by another network. See **Signal Interception**, page 68.
- **Observe through a Secondary Drone**: When directly controlling one drone, a rigger may casually observe (as in the Free Action Observe) through a secondary drone. See **Operative Modes**.
- **Operate a Drone**: While jumped into a drone, the rigger may operate it as if he was driving it. He can perform any of the five standard vehicle actions—accelerating/braking, positioning, ramming and hiding—with the drone, and can use his **Control Pool** and rigger bonuses. (See **Vehicle Combat**, p. 45.)
- **Reconnect a Lost Carrier**: A rigger may attempt to re-establish a remote control channel lost through electronic warfare. See **Re-connecting Lost Carriers**, page 72.
- **Regenerate Channel Degradation**: A rigger may attempt to use **ECCM** to purge one remote control channel of degradation caused by **MIJI**. See **Regenerating MIJI Degradation**, page 72.

### DRONES

Drones are unmanned vehicles that can be controlled via rigger networks, such as remote-control networks or security systems. Nearly any kind of vehicle—matchbox-sized cars, dwarf-sized rotor crafts, ground patrol vehicles the size of a large dog, even modified sports cars—may serve as drones.

The key difference that sets drones apart from ordinary vehicles is a unique vehicle rating called the **Pilot Rating**. All drones have a **Pilot Rating**, which represents the drone's self-piloting system and enables the drone to act independently of its controller to a limited degree.

A drone must be adapted for rigger control (however, it need not be fitted with a datajack system unless the rigger intends to physically jack into the vehicle). All drones that are incapable of carrying passengers are automatically pre-adapted for rigger control. Passenger vehicles or larger passenger drones are not usually pre-adapted, but most can be adapted quickly by the manufacturer, a mechanic or even the rigger herself (see **Vehicle Design and Customization**, p. 118).

**OPERATIVE MODES**
All affiliated drones operate under primary or secondary mode. A rigger may operate only one drone in her network on primary mode. This enables the rigger to control the drone as if she was directly jacked into it. The rigger may use **Combat** and **Control Pool** dice when making tests for the drone and receives all rigger bonuses for those tests.

**Success Tests** for secondary drones are made with the drones' **Pilot Ratings** rather than the rigger's Skill or Attribute Ratings. Only **IVIS Pool** dice may be used for secondary drone tests. (For more information about the **IVIS Pool**, see **The BattleTac IVIS System**, p. 67.)

If a rigger is jumped into a primary drone, the rigger can only casually observe through the sensors of her secondary drones, and she must spend a Complex Action to do so. Additionally, **Comprehension Tests** made by the secondary drones to comprehend commands suffer a +2 modifier if the rigger issues those commands while she is running her primary drone. (See **Issuing Commands**, p. 66.)

**Captain's Chair Mode**
Instead of jumping into one drone, a rigger can supervise all the drones in her network via her remote control deck's master control. Riggers call this practice "sitting in the captain's chair."

When operating drones in the captain's chair mode, a rigger cannot use her **Combat** or **Control Pool** dice for drone tests. However, the rigger may still use her **Task Pool** dice and still receives Initiative bonuses.

The captain's chair mode is the only drone-control method available to characters who do not possess a **VCR** implant.

After barely escaping from an ambush while meeting with their Johnson, Rigger X and his team have hunkered down in a safehouse. Rigger X has deployed three of his drones—a Condor surveillance drone, a Doberman patrol vehicle and an armed spotter drone. Rigger X is operating his network in the captain's chair mode, monitoring all three drones simultaneously.

The Condor detects a Mitsuhama security transport closing on their location and beeps an alert to Rigger X. Although he is in captain's chair mode, Rigger X receives his usual Initiative bonus, which allows him to add 2D6 to his Initiative roll (and act first).

However, if Rigger X orders his drones to attack the transport, neither drone can receive bonus dice from any of Rigger X's dice pools. Further, both drones would use their **Pilot Ratings** instead of Rigger X's Skill or Attribute Ratings for their **Success Tests**.

The spotter drone is closest to the MCT transport, so Rigger X jumps into that drone's rigger module and makes the spotter his primary drone. Rigger X is now directly controlling the drone, so he can draw dice from his **Control** and **Combat Pools** to augment **Success Tests** made with that drone. However, if Rigger X wanted to see what another drone was seeing, he would have to spend a Complex Action to do so. Also, if Rigger X wanted to order the Doberman to attack the transport as well, the Doberman would receive a +2 target modifier on its **Comprehension Test**.

**ISSUING COMMANDS**
When riggers are jacked into remote control decks, they may issue commands to drones at the same time that they declare their own actions (Step 2B of the Combat Turn Sequence, p. 78, SRII).

Issuing a command to a drone requires one Complex Action. A rigger can issue only one command to a single drone regardless of how many drones his remote control deck is managing at that time. For example, a rigger may be controlling ten drones, but he may directly command only one of them with a Complex Action. However, if more than one drone is receiving an identical command—"leave this area," or "attack this target," for example—the rigger may command them as a group. The maximum number of drones that a rigger can command is dictated by the remote control deck (see **Subscriber Lists**, p. 62).

If a rigger has jumped into a primary drone, he controls the drone as if he was driving it personally. He does not have to spend a Complex Action commanding that drone to act, but he does have to spend a Complex Action to issue a command to another drone.

A rigger can issue a drone one-sentence commands such as "circle this area," "shoot anyone who comes through this door," "follow that car," and the like. The more specific and detailed the command, the greater the chance the drone's pilot will become confused, however. The gamemaster should rate the command's complexity (using the **Skill Success Table** on p. 68, SRII), set the target number for the test and give the rigger the option to downgrade the complexity before issuing the command.

The player then makes a **Comprehension Test** for the drone, rolling a number of dice equal to the drone's **Pilot Rating** against the target number. If the test generates at least one success, the drone comprehends the command and executes it. However, the more successes the test generates, the more leeway the drone has in "interpreting" the command (to the rigger's benefit). The gamemaster may even permit the rigger to decide what the drone does in response to a circumstance that runs counter to the rigger's instructions.

Additionally, riggers may use the **Non-Matrix Programming Specialization** of the **Computer Skill** to help their drones understand commands, because the specialization teaches riggers how to phrase complex commands in an orderly, logical fashion. Riggers may add a number of dice equal to their level in this specialization to the drone's **Comprehension Test**. However, the number of dice may not exceed the drone's **Pilot Rating**. No other dice pools may be used for this test.

When making **Success Tests**, drones not directly controlled by the rigger use their **Pilot Ratings** in place of the rigger's Skill or Attribute Ratings. Drones do not gain the benefit of dice pools, with the sole exception of the **IVIS Pool** (see **IVIS Pool**, below).

All drones in a remote control network act during the same Combat Phase as the rigger acts, whether or not a rigger is directly controlling them. The rigger acts first, then all drones follow.

**THE BATTLETAC IVIS SYSTEM**
The **BattleTac IVIS (Inter-Vehicle Information System)** is an extension of the **BattleTac** system. The basic **BattleTac** system enhances small-unit tactics among a group of soldiers; **BattleTac IVIS** (or simply "IVIS") does much the same for drones, and is used in conjunction with the **Vehicle Tactics Specialization** of the **Tactics Concentration**.

**IVIS** enables a rigger to give a complex mission to a group of drones. All the drones in the group must possess **IVIS** software as part of their **Pilot** programs.

**IVIS Test**
To use **IVIS**, the rigger makes an **IVIS Test** before making the **Comprehension Test** for the group of drones. The player rolls a number of dice equal to her **Vehicle Tactics Specialization** against a Target Number 5. **Skill Web** modifiers (p. 48, **SRComp**) apply if the rigger must default to the **Tactics Concentration** or **Military Theory Skill**.

A rigger may use the successes generated by the **IVIS Test** to add dice to the drone group's **Comprehension Test**, to create a temporary dice pool called the **IVIS Pool**, or both. For example, if a rigger's **IVIS Test** generates 5 successes, she may add 5 dice to the **Comprehension Test** or create a 5 dice **IVIS Pool**. She could also split the result in various combinations—for example, adding 2 dice to the **Comprehension Test** and creating a 3D6 **IVIS Pool**.

**IVIS Pool**
**IVIS Pool** dice are available to any drone within an **IVIS** group and may be used on any action performed by those drones. **IVIS Pool** dice refresh at the end of each Combat Turn until the drone group completes the assigned task or receives a new task. At either point, the **IVIS Pool** ceases to exist and the rigger must make a new **IVIS Test** to form another **IVIS Pool** for another task. **IVIS Pool** dice are not available to drones that a rigger has jumped into.

### ROBOTS

A robot is an advanced form of drone. Like standard drones, robots possess a **Pilot Rating**, which represents the computer that gives the robot its limited autonomy. Unlike drones, however, robots contain advanced computer technology based on the semi-autonomous knowbot—computer technology that allows a robot to change its algorithm to adjust to new situations. In effect, robots can "learn" and adapt their behavior to better fulfill their mission requirements. To reflect this capability in game play, robots have **Dice Pools** and **Threat Ratings**, which standard drones do not possess. Robots may use **Learning Pool** dice and generate their own Initiative.

Though they can act with limited autonomy, robots are not true artificial intelligences. They have no self-awareness and cannot actually think for themselves. Robots cannot interface with the Matrix, nor can anything from the Matrix affect them.

**LEARNING POOL**
A robot's **Learning Pool** is equal to its **Pilot Rating**. A robot can draw dice from its **Learning Pool** to augment any **Success Test** that a standard character would augment with **Combat, Control** or **Task Pool** dice. As with those pools, the **Learning Pool** refreshes at the start of each Combat Turn and at each phase in which a robot can act.

Additionally, a robot equipped with **BattleTac IVIS** may also draw dice from an **IVIS Pool**. **Learning Pool** dice are not available, however, if a rigger is directly controlling the robot.

**INITIATIVE**
Because robots can learn and adapt, they need not act simultaneously with the rigger like standard drones. To reflect this capability, robots have their own **Reaction Ratings** and generate their own Initiative.

A robot's **Reaction** is equal to twice its **Pilot Rating**. The number of dice used is equal to the **Learning Pool** plus one, to a maximum of 4. Note that these dice are not **Learning Pool** dice and are not drawn from the **Learning Pool**. Additionally, no **Learning Pool** dice can be used for **Initiative Tests**.

### ELECTRONIC WARFARE

The open airwaves are the only means by which to remotely command and control the drones within a network, which makes networks vulnerable to electronic warfare. Electronic intruders can "jam" a network's signals and deny a rigger control over her drones, override transmissions to and from drones, and mislead the rigger with false information.

Because of the special nature of the **MSST** (mobile subscriber simsense technology) system for remote control networks (the protocol remote-control decks use to communicate with their drones), the rules for electronic warfare against remote control networks differ from the rules for electronic warfare against standard radios (p.184, SRII) and the **Electronic Countermeasures** rules for Sensor Systems (see **Electronic Countermeasures**, p. 31).

Electronic warfare attempts may succeed to a variety of degrees. Unlike **ECM**, which totally disrupts a radio signal, electronic warfare attempts may simply degrade the quality of the net and make command and control more difficult, or they may allow an intruder to take control of an opponent's drones. Complete signal disruption almost never occurs.

Electronic warfare is a two-step process. First, the intruder must intercept the signals of the targeted network. Then the intruder may perform one of four more aggressive operations against the network—meaconing, intrusion, jamming or interference—collectively known as **MIJI**.

**SIGNAL INTERCEPTION**
**Signal interception** is both a means to an end and an end in itself. The first step in conducting electronic warfare, it is a passive assault that allows the intruding rigger to know what his intended target is doing before going on to more aggressive measures. Think of it as listening in on a telephone conversation—you may have no idea of who called whom or who is doing the talking, but you can get all the information exchanged by the two parties on the line. In a similar manner, signal interception allows an intruding rigger to eavesdrop on one of his opponent's signal bands and pick up all the information being transmitted via that band.

Before an intruder can attempt electronic warfare operations against a network, he must first intercept the radio frequencies on which his target is operating, which means locating the airwave frequency of the target network's command, simsense or system channels. The command channel relays messages that direct the movements and actions of the drones, as well as situational information and intelligence between the remote deck and the drones. The simsense channel routes audio, visual and simsense data between drones, deck and rigger. The system channel carries data that ensures network integrity and monitors drone status, and also routes data for indirect-fire attacks made with the network.

To intercept any of these channels, the intruder must be within range to transmit his own signals to the opposing remote control deck. Both the targeted deck and the intruder's jamming device must be within the range of the least powerful device. (The range of an electronic device depends on its **Flux Rating**; see **Flux Rating and Range**, p. 30.)

If that condition is met, the intruder may attempt the interception by rolling a number of dice equal to the rating of his device (see **MIJI**) against a target number equal to the target's **Deck Rating** plus 3. Player-character intruders may add **Task Pool** dice to this test.

For each success generated on the test, the intruder intercepts one of the network's channels. If the character is not attempting to intercept a specific channel, the gamemaster may select which channel is intercepted.

**DEFEATING DECK ENCRYPTION**
Some paranoid riggers (aren't they all?) encrypt their decks. Defeating encryption on an **RC** deck works differently than dealing with an **Encrypted System** (see **The Security Rigger**, p. 80). If the targeted deck is fitted with encryption devices, the intruder must defeat the encryption before he can intercept signals. The intruder must make an **Electronic Warfare Concentration Test** against a target number equal to the targeted deck's **Encryption Rating** plus 4. The intruder may use **Task Pool** dice for this test. The test must generate a number of successes greater than half the targeted deck's rating, rounded up; otherwise, the attempt fails.

If the attempt to defeat encryption fails, the targeted rigger realizes that someone is trying to intercept his transmissions and places his network on alert. Apply a +2 target modifier to all subsequent **Interception Tests** made against the network, including any **MIJI** attacks. This modifier is cumulative with each unsuccessful attempt to defeat encryption. If the test was successful, then the targeted rigger does not know someone is listening in on his deck's signals.

A rigger may outfit his deck with a decryption device (see **New Toys**, p. 98). In such a case, he adds that device's Rating in dice to his **Electronic Warfare Concentration Test**.

M.C. Jammer (**Electronic Warfare 7**) is trying to intercept the system channel of a remote control network controlled by an Aztechnology rigger with a **Rating 6** remote control deck.

To identify the frequency of the channel, Jammer rolls 5 dice (Jammer has a **Rating 5** deck) against a Target Number 9 (the Azzie has a **Rating 6** deck, plus 3). Jammer's test generates 1 success, so he locates the Azzie's system channel.

But before he can intercept the signal on the channel, he has to defeat the deck's encryption. The target number for the **Electronic Warfare Concentration Test** is 8 (the Azzie deck's **Encryption Rating 4**, plus 4 equals 8). Jammer has to achieve at least 3 successes, because the deck's Rating is 6 and half of 6 is 3. Jammer's player decides to add all 4 of his **Task Pool** dice to the test. That gives him 11 dice for the test (7 dice for his rating in **Electronic Warfare**, plus 4 **Task Pool** dice).

Jammer's test generates 3 successes, so he breaks the Aztechnology encryption. Had his test generated only 1 or 2 successes, however, the Azzie rigger would have been tipped off to the attempt, and the network would have gone on alert. Consequently, the target number for Jammer's next attempt would have increased by 2, to 10.

If the interception attempt succeeds, the intruder locates the appropriate channel and can read any data being carried over that channel by spending a Complex Action.

If the intruder intercepts the simsense channel, the intruder can see, hear and sense anything that the targeted network's drones are monitoring with their sensors. If the intruder intercepts the system channel, he can instantly get information on the position, direction of travel, ammunition and damage status of any single drone in the network. Intercepting the command channel allows the rigger to overhear commands being issued from the opposing rigger to the drones in that rigger's network.

However, each time an intruder spends an action in this manner, he runs the risk of discovery. Any time the intruder takes such an action, the gamemaster makes a **Success Test** for the targeted network using a number of dice equal to the targeted deck's rating against a target number equal to the intruder's **Electronic Warfare Concentration**. If the test succeeds, the network detects the intruder, goes on alert and switches all of its frequencies and prefix codes. The intruder must make another **Interception Test** to intercept the network's transmissions, this time with a +2 target modifier.

**MIJI**
**MIJI** (pronounced "mee-jee") is an acronym that stands for meaconing, intrusion, jamming and interference. Intrusion, jamming and interference are self-explanatory. Meaconing allows a rigger to introduce false signals into another rigger's network. It affects drones in much the same way a confusion spell affects a person. In each case, the intruder disrupts the targeted deck's transmissions and sends false signals to the network's deck and drones.

To perform one of these electronic warfare operations, the intruder and the targeted rigger make a **MIJI Test**—an opposed **Success Test**. The intruder rolls a number of dice equal to his device's **Flux Rating** against a target number equal to the target deck's rating. The targeted rigger rolls a number of dice equal to his deck's **Flux Rating**. If the intruder is attempting meaconing, intrusion or interference, the targeted rigger makes his test against a target number equal to the intruder's **Protocol Emulation**.

Module Rating. If the intruder is attempting to jam the targeted network, the rigger makes his test against the **ECM Rating** of the intruder's device. (For more information on the protocol emulation module, see **New Toys**, p. 98.)

Both the intruder and the targeted rigger may use **Task Pool** dice for these tests.

If the targeted rigger wins, the network's channels remain open and clear. If the intruder wins, he inflicts damage in the form of signal degradation on the network. This degradation is recorded on the network's **Signal Monitor**, in the same way character damage is recorded on a character's **Condition Monitor**. Each success on the opposed test produces one box of signal degradation on the targeted network's **Signal Monitor**.

The specific operation attempted—meaconing, intrusion, jamming or interference—determines which channel of the network experiences the degradation. As the degradation level of a channel increases, target number modifiers are applied to all tests for actions controlled by the degraded channel. When all the boxes of a channel's **Signal Monitor** are filled, the intruder effectively shuts out the remote control deck and can assume control of operations performed by that channel.

**MEACONING**
In a meaconing attack, an intruder attempts to degrade the targeted deck's command or system channel integrity and introduce false system signals into the targeted network to degrade the **Pilot Ratings** of the network's drones.

To perform a meaconing attack, an intruder must have a remote control deck equipped with a protocol emulation module. The intruder and the targeted rigger then make a **MIJI Test** as described above.

Degradation modifiers generated by a successful meaconing attack apply to **Driving Tests, Gunnery Tests** and tests for other physical actions made with a drone's **Pilot Rating**, as well as **IVIS Tests**. They do not apply to **Comprehension Tests** made by drones trying to understand commands from the targeted rigger, nor to drones directly controlled by a rigger.

Trixie is providing rigger cover for her shadowrunner team as they exit a corporate compound. When several security drones suddenly attack them, Trixie decides to use her remote control deck to make a meaconing attack against the security network and reduce the drones' capabilities.

The first thing she needs to do is make a **Signal Interception Test**. Trixie has a **Rating 6** remote control deck (**Flux Rating 8**), while the corporate remote control network uses a **Rating 3** remote control deck (**Flux Rating 5**). Trixie is in range, so she rolls 6 dice (her deck's rating) against a Target Number 6 (the corp network's rating of 3 + 3). She adds three **Task Pool** dice and generates 1 success. The gamemaster determines that Trixie intercepts the system channel, which is all she wanted to accomplish for her meaconing attack.

Trixie then rolls 8 dice (her deck's **Flux Rating**) against a Target Number 3 (the corp network's rating) for her half of the opposed **MIJI Test**. The gamemaster, making the test for the corp rigger, rolls 5 dice (the corp rigger's **Flux Rating**) against a Target Number 6 (Trixie's deck rating).

Trixie's test generated 5 successes, while the corp network generated only 1. That gives Trixie a Success Margin of 4, so the gamemaster marks off 4 boxes on the corp network's system channel, which results in Moderate degradation. The corp drones now receive a +2 modifier to any actions they take against the shadowrunners.

**INTRUSION**
In an intrusion attack, the would-be intruder attempts to feed false information into the targeted remote control network. This information could be a false target for indirect fire on the system channel, bogus intelligence on the command channel, or even a forged simsense clip on the simsense channel.

To attempt an intrusion, the intruder must possess a remote control deck and a protocol emulation module (for generating the false objects). Intrusion may be directed at a network's system, command or simsense channel.

If the intruder prevails in the **MIJI Test**, he creates the appropriate bogus object on the targeted network's appropriate channel. The targeted rigger will believe the object is real unless he rolls at least 2 successes on a **Perception (3) Test**. Apply all appropriate degradation modifiers.

A successful **Perception Test** enables the targeted rigger to recognize the object as bogus, but his drones will continue to regard it as real until he dispels the illusion by blocking the intrusion with **ECCM** (see **Electronic Countermeasures**, p. 31).

If desired, an intruder may create a more convincing computer-generated bogus object before making his intrusion attempt. The intruder must have a computer and spend 1D6 + 1 hours to do so. The intruder makes an **Open Success Test** with his **Computer Skill** (or **Non-Matrix Programming Specialization**). Use the test result as the target number for the targeted rigger's **Perception Test**.

Josie Cruise (**Computer 3**) is flying her team in on her helicopter Angelfire. The team is making its way to an isolated Cross Technologies laboratory in Tenino, just outside the Seattle metroplex limits. Josie is bringing her team in from the north, so she decides to make an intrusion against the lab security network's system channel and generate a false radar contact to the south to distract the lab's air-patrol drones. Josie makes a successful **Signal Interception Test**, so she manages to intercept the system channel.

Josie was expecting the drones, so before the run she spent some time on her computer generating images of enemy drones flying just above the treetops. She makes her **Open Computer Test** and generates a result of 8.

The opposed **MIJI Test** pits Josie and her onboard remote control deck (**Rating 5, Flux 8**) against the lab's remote-control security system (**Rating 4, Flux 6**). Josie rolls 8 dice against a Target Number 4, while the gamemaster rolls 6 dice against a Target Number 5. Josie generates 5 successes, while the lab network generates 3, so Josie wins the test by 2 net successes.

Consequently, the lab's patrol drones fly off to the south, leaving no one to intercept Angelfire as it approaches from the north.

Additionally, the gamemaster marks off 2 system channel boxes on the lab network's **Signal Monitor**. That results in Light degradation. As a result, the lab's rigger must generate 2 successes on a **Perception Test** against a base Target Number 8 (the result of Josie's **Computer Test**) to recognize that the enemy drones are not real. A +1 target modifier for Light degradation applies to the test as well.

**JAMMING**
In a jamming attack, the intruder uses electronic countermeasures (**ECM**) to flood the targeted network's channels with electronic noise—crude, but effective. The intruder must possess **ECM** in addition to a remote control deck to make a jamming attack.

If the intruder succeeds in the **MIJI Test**, his **ECM** floods one of the targeted network's channels with electronic noise and degrades its signal quality. The intruder decides which channel is targeted; the effects of the jamming vary with each channel.

**Command Channel**
Command channel jamming causes degradation to command channel signals and adds degradation target modifiers to drone **Comprehension Tests** (see **Issuing Commands**, p. 66) and **MIJI Tests**. If all 10 boxes on the command channel **Signal Monitor** are filled, the drones are cut off from the network. They either carry out the last command given to them or maintain a holding pattern where they are, taking action only in self-defense.

**Simsense Channel**
Simsense channel jamming causes degradation to simsense channel signals and adds degradation target modifiers to all **Perception Tests** and **Manual Gunnery Tests** made by the rigger through the drone.

If a rigger is remotely rigging a drone through the deck, degradation modifiers on the simsense channel affect the rigger's target numbers and penalize Initiative in the same way as standard damage modifiers. If a rigger is jumped into a drone or **RPV** when the carrier signal is lost (meaning that all 10 boxes are filled on the simsense channel **Signal Monitor**) for that drone, the rigger also suffers dump shock (see **Dump Shock**, p. 64).

**System Channel**
System channel jamming disrupts a network's indirect fire coordination and affects the performance of its **BattleTac Fire Direction Data Manager** system (**New Toys**, p. 97). Degradation modifiers from the system channel **Signal Monitor** apply to **Indirect Fire Gunnery Tests** made with the network (see **Indirect Fire**, p. 60).

**INTERFERENCE**
In an interference attack, the intruder attempts to override the targeted network with his own signals. If the attempt succeeds, the intruder literally hijacks the network from the targeted rigger's control.

To make an interference attempt, the intruder must possess a remote control deck with a protocol emulation module. Interference affects the targeted network's system channel only; it has no effect on the command or simsense channels.

The interference **MIJI Test** works a bit differently than other **MIJI Tests**. Specifically, the intruder's own system channel suffers degradation if he loses the test.

In the Combat Phase following the first **MIJI Test**, either the intruder or the defending rigger may spend a Complex Action to make an interference attack or counterattack and trigger another **MIJI Test**. The players may make subsequent attacks and counterattacks until one of them manages to inflict 10 boxes worth of degradation on his opponent's system channel, or until a rigger exits the system. Whichever player achieves the required amount of damage first—or stays in the system after his opponent has exited—takes control of the opponent's entire network. The loser is shut out of the network and suffers dump shock (see **Dump Shock**, p. 64).

M.C. Jammer is using his remote control deck (**Rating 5, Flux 7**) to make an interference attack after a successful **Signal Interception** against an Aztechnology remote control network (**Rating 6, Flux 4**).

For the opposed **MIJI Test**, Jammer's player rolls 7 dice against a Target Number 6. The gamemaster rolls 4 dice against a Target Number 5. Jammer generates 1 success, while the gamemaster gets none. The gamemaster fills in 1 degradation box on the Azzie's system channel **Signal Monitor**.

During the next Combat Phase, the Aztechnology rigger spends a Complex Action to counter the interference attempt. Jammer generates no successes on the opposed **MIJI Test** this time, but the gamemaster scores 2 successes for the Azzie rigger. Jammer fills in 2 degradation boxes on his system channel **Signal Monitor**.

After two more interference tests, the Aztechnology rigger has 8 degradation boxes filled on his system channel **Signal Monitor**, while Jammer has 6 boxes filled on his own monitor. Jammer makes another interference attack, and both sides roll dice for the **MIJI Test**. Jammer's player rolls 4 successes, while the gamemaster gets none. That fills the remaining degradation boxes on the system channel of the Azzie rigger's **Signal Monitor**, so the Azzie rigger is dumped from his system. Jammer takes control of the network and immediately commands its drones to attack the Aztechnology guards.

**REGENERATING MIJI DEGRADATION**
Riggers may use **ECCM** to "heal" signal degradation caused by **MIJI** attacks and restore channel integrity.

To do so, the rigger must spend a Complex Action and make an **ECCM Test** against a target number equal to the intruder's device rating (either the intruder's deck or **ECM** rating, whichever is higher) plus 3. **Task Pool** dice may be used on the test. For every 2 successes generated, reduce the degradation on the selected channel by 1 box on the channel's **Signal Monitor**. Riggers may regenerate only one channel at a time.

**RE-CONNECTING LOST CARRIERS**
When a remote control deck loses a channel because of **MIJI** degradation, it loses the channel's carrier signal. To access a channel again, the deck must re-connect the carrier signal for that channel.

Before attempting to re-connect a lost carrier signal, the rigger must first make an **ECCM Test** to regenerate any signal degradation and clear boxes filled on the **Signal Monitor**. At least one box must be clear before the rigger can attempt to re-connect the carrier signal.

Then the rigger makes a **Control Systems Concentration Test**. If any degradation still exists on the channel, apply appropriate degradation modifiers. Any damage modifiers for Physical or Stun damage suffered by the rigger apply as well. If the number of successes exceeds the number of filled degradation boxes on the channel's **Signal Monitor**, the re-connection attempt succeeds.

### THE DUELISTS

**Sysop**: You are in the War Stories room.
**Hellcab**: Sounds like one helluva run, Jo.
**Josie Cruise**: (pop/fwsshhh/gluglugluglug) Bought and poured, Jo-girl. Spill.
**Hellcab**: I'll trust you for one in the meatworld (fool that I am ... ). Okay. I was in Calfree last spring, part of a team pulling a job on Yamatetsu. The corp had a hush-hush R&D compound up in the Northern Crescent, not far from Blue Lake. Our Johnson thought they were up to something biogenetically questionable (to put it nicely), and wanted us to get two kinds of proof: data and a sample. Get in, snatch the goodies and get out again—my specialty.

So we headed out from Redding, got as near to the compound as we could by off-roader, then bailed and started hoofing. I'm not going to bore you with the rigger's-eye-view of the ride up; half the folks on this board know what that's like, and anyways nothing happened. The fun stuff all came later.

Our Johnson was amazingly well-informed about the place she'd sent us to hit, so we had a pretty fair idea of where its defensive perimeter was. Yamatetsu had built the place in a little hollow between two hills—half inside the northernmost hill, to be exact. So we hunkered down just shy of the top of the southmost hill, and I called up a couple of Condors to go have a look-see.

You gotta love a Condor LDSD-23. Especially when it answers to a cranial remote deck. I got to try out almost all my new toys on this run ... but I'm getting ahead of myself. Anyways, for those few of you who don't know, the Condor's damned near the ultimate stealth drone. It soars up on its little balloon and sleazes right by a whole mess of sensors and radar, and not one of them sniffs a thing. My remote deck let me see the world through the drone's eyes, giving me as clear a picture of the compound's perimeter defenses as if I'd walked straight up to the fence and stuck my nose through it. Better, actually. The naked meat eye doesn't give you thermo or infrared unless you're the right metatype, and the metahuman nose can't chemsniff half as well as the chemical sensors my Condor was packing.

The Condor showed me about what I'd've expected from a hush-hush R&D compound—security was tight enough to safeguard the important drek inside, but nowhere near impossible. In a place like the Northern Crescent, if you're setting up a secret shop and don't want to attract attention, you really can't afford to dress up the outside of your research playground with every single bell and whistle ever thunk up by Ares Macrotech and KnightErrant and other purveyors of paranoiac pacifiers. You have to pick and choose, and layer your defenses. So I knew that getting the team through the perimeter was only going to be half the battle. Once I'd managed that, I'd have to take over the building's systems if I could—which meant going head-to-head with the security rigger we'd been told was there, probably. I was looking forward to it; things'd been kind of slow lately.

But first things first. The compound had a fence around the three sides that weren't under the hill, with tall skinny pillars spaced intermittently across it that I recognized as sensor posts. Motion and infrared, most likely. Through the fence I could also see Ferrets and Dobermans and even a couple of Guardians crawling along, patrolling the perimeter a lot more tirelessly and efficiently than meat guards would've done. (Cheaper, too; a drone doesn't need pay or health benefits and never takes personal time.) There were also gun emplacements, on the two fence corners and lined up across the roofline of the building. Sentry guns; I could tell by the shape. Not the mobile kind on a track, though. Likely they'd reserved those and the Sentry IIs for inside.

So I had my work cut out for me. I had to take out the sensor posts, drones and Sentries all in one shot, so the rest of the team could get up to the fence and through it without getting cut down by a hail of lead. Also without being spotted. The sec-rigger would know something was going down the minute I started to muck with his system, especially considering the level of mucking that was clearly going to be necessary—but the longer we could keep the opposition from knowing exactly what they were up against, the more time we'd buy for ourselves. And our job wouldn't take us that long.

I called my eye-in-the-sky back and whistled up three more drones. These had special jobs to do. Two of them were remote-adapted Artemises loaded with Jabberwockies, primed and ready to fire. The third drone, which I sent in first, was my favorite new toy: a Hedgehog signal interceptor, the very latest in seeing-eye techno-beasts.

**Nissan Barb**: Where in the name of the Great Ghost did you get a Hedgehog?! I thought the Azzies put a tight lock on distribution. They went to a lot of trouble to develop that puppy; they sure drek don't want street scum like us getting ahold of them. Who you do, sell your soul to Old Scratch or something?
**Hellcab**: Fell off the back of a t-bird, my fixer said. When somebody offers me a new piece of wizbang tech, I don't ask too many questions. The important thing is, I got it, and I used it when I needed it. Now don't interrupt my story; I'm on a roll here, 'kay?

The Hedgehog's a terrific piece of equipment. No rigger who can afford one should be without it, I don't care who you have to frag over or go to bed with. What this pup does, it tells you the signal strength, protocols and encryption that a system is using. In other words, the Hedgehog gave me the key to the compound's entire electronic security system just by reading the kinds of signals flowing through those sensor posts. Giving me the shape and size and taste of it, so to speak. (Not literally—but sometimes it's hard to put what a rigger gets from a drone into words that ordinary people can understand.) All this stuff was vital information that'd make the second half of my job—taking over the building system—that much quicker and easier.

Its job done, the Hedgehog crawled back. I shut it down and told the Artemises to fire their payload in ten seconds, then sent them soaring toward the fence. And braced myself against the hillside so I wouldn't fall over, because I knew I'd get it when the Jabberwockies hit. A Jabberwocky is a jammer missile, which disperses transponders instead of a warhead. The transponder signals frag up sensors, remote-control transmissions, you name it—in a fifty-yard or wider radius around the point of impact. So whatever disruption they caused, the Artemises they rode on would be nailed by it too. And since I was talking to the Artemises via remote deck, I knew I'd feel the backlash until I broke the link. But in the meantime, all those sensors and perimeter drones and every seeing-eye on the Sentry guns'd be blind and deaf and dumb. Which meant no security rigger was going to spot my team getting through the fence and inside.

**Silent Running**: Jeez. Why not just walk up to the front gate and shout hello? To take out such a huge chunk of a rigged building's security systems, the rigger's gonna know the place is under attack. No way can you pass that off as a malfunction, or a hair-trigger tripped by a high wind.
**Hellcab**: You missed a paragraph somewhere, didn't you? My team knew fragging well we were tipping corpsec off—but as long as they didn't know how big the threat was or exactly where it was coming from, all they could do was chase their tails. We figured we'd be in and gone before they twigged enough to matter. And we were right.

I counted down in my head, then watched the world go black and go dizzy for a few seconds until I closed off the link with the Artemises. I felt the rest of the team run by me, over the hill and down. While the mage tended to the magical barriers and the sams chopped through the wire, I crawled backward just enough to be completely out of range of Jabberwocky spillover, then called up the rest of my drone network. Wandjinas with Vanquishers mounted on them, these were; fast and deadly, just the thing for taking out perimeter drones. And I had to do that, both to keep myself safe once I started monkeying with the sensor port's datalines and also to keep the drones from bothering my buds on their way back out. The Jabberwocky jamming'd only keep the drones blind and deaf for so long; once it started to wear off, all those Ferrets and Dobermans and Guardians with their little turret guns would pose quite the nasty problem. Unless my Wandjinas took care of them first.

It's a weird, weird feeling, seeing through the eyes of half a dozen drones at once. Kind of like what I imagine bug eyes must be like—all those facets showing you overlapping pictures. Except that in my case, the pictures were different instead of the same image from different angles. To run a network like that through a cranial remote deck—or any kind of wiring, for that matter—you've got to be good at multi-tasking. If you can't concentrate on a dozen things at one time before breakfast, then don't even try this stuff. You'll just make yourself sick trying to track everything, and somebody else'll have to risk her hoop bailing you out of trouble. I don't have a problem with it; but then, I was the kind of kid who liked looking at those crazy optical-illusion prints with the upside-down staircases and stuff. I sent my Wandjinas around the edges of the Jabberwockies' area of effect—couldn't send them through it, or they'd be as blind as the sec-drones they were hunting—and waited for a clear target.

Then came the first sign of trouble. A pair of Condors appeared, floating high and distant over the top of the compound. Nuyen to noodles they were outside Jabberwocky range. They weren't mine, so I knew they could only have come from one source. The sec-rigger'd figured out that Something Big was up, and had sent a couple of spies to find out what the frag was going on.

Well, I'd expected that. Not quite so soon, though; when I finally got to tangling mano a mano with this guy, he was going to be good. The enemy Condors weren't armed, so I ignored them and got on with the primary task: nailing the daylights out of the blinded perimeter drones, some of which were still spinning around in crazed circles. At first my Wandjinas made short work of them. After awhile, though, I saw some of the ones that'd stopped dead starting to move—sluggishly, but with purpose. They were getting out of the Wandjinas' line of fire, and a couple of Guardians were even starting to swing their turrets back and forth. Bad news for me—either the Jabberwocky effect was wearing off or the sec-rigger was using a little **ECCM** to overcome the Jabberwocky interference. Either way, it meant I didn't have much time. I had to take over the building system before the perimeter drones recovered, or I'd be their sitting duck.

I slung my duffel bag over my shoulder and ran up to the nearest sensor post. The access panel was easy to spot; I blew the lock on it with a short strip of acid solder, then pulled a decryption module out of the duffel. Tech-heads like me use this little handheld meter doohickey to analyze and decrypt **CCSS** protocols. My Hedgehog had already told me the system was encrypted, which let me bypass the usual step of plugging in a protocol emulation module and using it to figure out what was there. Took lots less time this way, which was vital on this particular run.

I found the junction box and carefully opened the cover plate, exposing the optic cables and electrical wires inside. Then I took out my microtronics kit and delicately spliced my own leads into the system. As I started to connect the free ends of the splice into the decrypt module, I felt a bullet punch me in the side and flatten itself against my armor. The sec-rigger had managed to get at least some of his toys working again. I had to take care of them before jacking into the building system, or they'd take care of me. Lucky thing I'd brought along a signal amplifier.

The output from the signal booster let me call the Wandjinas in closer, within the range of the fading Jabberwocky interference. Thank the Ghost in the Machine for those boosters, and for the Battletac IVIS system some bright tech so recently came up with. Makes a combat-drone network sooo much easier to deal with ... and leaves part of a rigger's mind free to take on another job, like connecting illicit wiretaps and turning on a decrypt module. The 'jinas took out a Ferret and a Guardian that were far too close for comfort. Now, I thought, and jacked in.

Overriding a security rig is a tough job. Unlike decking, you can't rely on a clever bag of tricks to outwit any **IC** or other deckers you happen across. Instead, it's a pure battle of wills between you and the sec-rigger. The toughest mind wins; the loser usually ends up brain-fried or dead.

**E-slipper**: Just for the record, decking into a system is NOT easy. And I resent any implication to the contrary.
**Hellcab**: Didn't mean to rile you, E. I didn't say decking was easy. But it is different than the way a rigger taps into a system. I just wanted to get that point across.

And now back to our feature presentation.

A flood of images and voices surrounded me, as if I'd invaded someone else's brain (which, in a way, I had). I built a mental wall around myself as fast as I could, then formed a fist of pure willpower and struck out hard at the source of the flood. I felt an echo of dizzy pain as the blow connected—then a wallop, much more immediate and powerful enough to send my virtual self sprawling on my hoop. The sec-rigger was fighting back—and as I'd guessed, he was no slouch in the battle-of-wills department. I could feel the shape and weight of his virtual body, saw the two of us locked together in a wrestling hold. One or the other would have to give, and I was determined it wouldn't be me.

Distantly, as if my meat body belonged to someone else, I felt the impact of more bullets against my heavy armor. I ordered my Wandjinas to redouble their assault. A few seconds later I felt the sec-rigger reel away from me, and I knew that one of my drones had blown up one of his. Impressive that he'd managed to hang in; half the time, a direct hit on a drone you're controlling will dump you right out of the system. It isn't only deckers who have to worry about dump shock.

The next minute, that worry hit me over the head with all the subtlety of a tire iron. A Guardian got off a lucky shot that took out one of my Wandjinas, and the resulting nasty feedback damn near made me black out from pain. But I couldn't afford to black out. I had to win this fight or die trying.

My control of the rest of my drone network was hanging by a thread. Sick and dizzy, trying to ignore the red-and-black flashes that kept cutting across my vision, I pulled a sneaky tactic that had the added virtue of not demanding mental effort. I pushed a button on my decrypt module and sent a complicated encryption protocol down the dataline. As I expected, the sec-drones that had been moving toward me slowed down, then stopped. None of them fired. My little encryption trick had slowed the sec-rigger's response time dramatically while he tried to sort out just what the frag I'd done. Now I had time to shake off the not-quite-dump shock and sneak up on the fragger.

I focused inward, then made an even bigger mental fist and slammed it down on the ghostly outlines of the sec-rigger's virtual body. As his mind wavered under the impact, I wrapped my virtual arms around his middle and squeezed. Hard. His virtual shape began to collapse, curling into a fetal position and then melting into a shapeless mass.

Then his collapse speeded up. He was trying to wriggle out of my grip before I throttled him into a coma. A dark hole of nothingness suddenly opened nearby, and the sec-rigger flowed toward it. Little fragger was trying to jack out. I stretched out a virtual leg and blocked the entrance to the hole, then wrapped around the sec-rigger again and squeezed some more until I couldn't sense his presence anywhere in the system.

I'd won. I was the building now; I could feel every square inch of it, plus all the perimeter drones that had been doing their level best to knock out my Wandjinas. First thing I did was order the sec-drones to back off. I kept them active, though, in case I might need them to help my buds on the way out. (That old martial arts rule is dead on target; use your enemy's strength against him as much as you can. Saves you the trouble of doing all the work yourself, and surprises the hell out of the bad guys.) The next thing I did was find my team, just in time to open some convenient doors for them without tripping any alarms. I also kept track of the Yamatetsu security guards, alerted to trouble by the security rig before I'd dealt with him. Thanks to my Jabberwockies, they had no idea who was attacking their facility or where the team was. They jogged up and down corridors at random, not knowing where to go. For the sheer fun of it, I set off a gaggle of motion sensors several hundred yards away from where my team was. The razorboys dashed off, each of them eager to be the first one to nail himself a real live intruder.

Needless to say, we pulled off the run and were well compensated for it. Which just goes to show what a talented rigger can do—especially if she spends her cred wisely.

**Josie Cruise**: Hellcab, you're my kind of rigger. Come by for a beer sometime, okay?
**Hellcab**: I'll take you up on that, Jo-girl. When I get through with this next run ...
**Josie Cruise**: You know what? Let's talk again sometime. I think you and I have some things in common.
**Hellcab**: I'm thinking the same thing, chummer.
**Sysop**: End of transmission.

### THE SECURITY RIGGER

Security riggers use closed-circuit simsense systems (**CCSS**) to control the security systems of entire buildings or facilities via remote technology. The closed-circuit system gives the rigger control of all drones patrolling that site and enables him to automatically sense any event that the site's security sensors detect.

**ACTIVE SECURITY RIGGERS**
When a security rigger jacks into a **CCSS** and becomes "active," he is said to "assume the body." This mode enables the rigger to visualize a three-dimensional map of the security system under his control, experience the system's sensor input and status as physical sensations, and control the system through neurological impulses.

The rigger experiences local radio traffic picked up by the system's sensors as auditory sensations. All **CCSS** systems use scanning receivers to monitor various friendly frequencies and intercept potentially hostile radio transmissions. (**CCSSs** are commonly equipped with decryption systems that have ratings equal to the system's **Security Level**.)

Normally, the system's security devices—drones, weapon ports, security doors, gas vents, cameras and such—operate on "autopilot" when they are not under the rigger's active control. If a device detects an anomaly or an automatic alarm goes off, the security system's main computer contacts the security rigger, using sensory stimuli to gain his attention.

If a security system also has mobile drones under its control, the rigger may command them as if he was in the "captain's chair" mode and controlling drones via a standard remote control network. The maximum number of drones a rigger can command is equal to the rating of the rigger's remote control deck.

Individual sensor triggers, such as a **CCSS**-rigged door being opened and closed or unidentified personnel moving through the corridor, register as tactile sensations on the rigger's skin. The trigger's degree of importance determines the intensity of the sensation. Regular triggers, such as the opening of a door to a sensitive area, register as mere twitches on the skin, while a red alert with full klaxons may come across like a burn from a hot iron. To determine whether a rigger recognizes important sensations, the gamemaster makes a secret **Perception Test** for the rigger whenever a significant trigger occurs. If the test succeeds, the rigger notices the trigger. Target numbers for the **Rigger Perception Tests Table** appear in the table below. If the alarm or sensors have been triggered, the security rigger automatically knows someone is there; no Perception Test is required.

---

### RIGGER PERCEPTION TESTS TABLE

The table you provided was garbled. I've found and formatted the corrected version below.

?.?.?.?

| Trigger Condition                      | Perception Test Target Number |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Security door or gate opening/closing  | 5                             |

?.?.?.?

When security riggers "jump" into particular components or component groups of a **CCSS**, their audio/visual perceptions shift into real-time perceptions of the vicinity immediately surrounding the component, to a maximum of any single room less than 100 square meters and any corridor less than 25 meters long. However, they retain awareness of the overall security system through their tactile senses. Security riggers can jump into a drone or into the groups of active security measures and countermeasures in a particular site location, such as a room or a corridor. In the latter case, the rigger would take command of doors, climate control, gun ports and the like within that area.

Note that riggers can perceive events only in the area covered by their **CCSS**. For example, a corporation might use several closed-circuit systems to cover different parts of a facility. If a rigged system covers only part of a facility, the rigger knows which sections the rigged system does not cover and will not know what is going on there.

**ACTIONS IN A CCSS**
Riggers may perform the following actions in a closed-circuit simsense system.

**FREE ACTIONS**
- **Activate/Deactivate Sensors**: The rigger may activate or deactivate sensors for one drone. Activated sensors will be online at the start of the next Combat Turn.
- **Arm/Disarm a Weapon System**: The rigger may arm or disarm one weapon system mounted on a drone or fixed weapon port.
- **Delay Action**: Per standard combat rules.
- **Call up an Overall Status Report**: The rigger may monitor the overall status of the security system.
- **Observe**: The rigger may observe through any single drone, a single room's sensors, or the sensors in a section of corridor. This is the same as the standard Free Action Observe (p. 81, SRII).
- **Speak a Word**: A rigger may broadcast a message via intercom to a room, a group of rooms, a section of corridor or an entire facility. This action follows standard combat rules (p. 81, SRII).
- **Suppress Automatic Alarms**: The rigger may suppress an automatic alarm within the limits described in the previous column.

**SIMPLE ACTIONS**
- **Observe in Detail**: The rigger may observe in detail (p. 81, SRII) through any single drone, room or section of corridor.
- **Jump into a Primary Drone**: The rigger takes direct control of a single drone. (See **Operative Modes**, p. 65.)
- **Monitor Radio Traffic**: The rigger may monitor radio communications on a single radio frequency.

**COMPLEX ACTIONS**
- **Control a Room**: The rigger may take direct control of all weapon systems, security doors or other mechanical security systems in a single room or a section of corridor. Rigger bonuses and all dice pools apply in this mode. (See **Rigger Bonuses in a CCSS**.)
- **Fire a Weapon System**: The rigger may fire an armed weapon mounted on a drone or a weapon port. Riggers can use their **Combat Pool** only with drones or rooms they are controlling directly. (See **Rigger Bonuses in a CCSS**.)
- **Issue a Command**: The rigger may issue a command to a drone or a group of drones. The maximum number of drones a rigger can command is equal to the rating of the rigger's remote control deck. (See **Issuing Commands**, p. 66.)
- **Operate a Drone**: While jumped into a drone, the rigger may operate it as if she was driving it and use her **Control Pool** and rigger bonuses. (See **Drones**, p. 65.)
- **Turn On/Turn Off a Device**: While directly controlling a room or corridor section, the rigger may turn on or off any unspecified devices such as gas vents, sprinkler systems or lights. The rigger can also adjust the setting of variable-setting devices such as thermostats and fans.

**RIGGER BONUSES IN A CCSS**
Security riggers automatically gain the Initiative bonuses conferred by the vehicle control rig, as well as other cyberware described in **The Rigger** (pp. 16-18). Additionally, riggers may use their **Task Pools** to defeat encryption and adjust to system protocols. However, when battling a security rigger, an intruding rigger can use no dice pools except for his **Karma Pool**. Likewise, NPC riggers fighting to retain control of a **CCSS** system can draw on **Threat/Professional Rating** dice to augment their success tests.

When riggers "assume the body," they do not have access to any of their dice pools except the **Karma Pool**. Riggers gain access to their dice pools when they jump into a drone, room or corridor, however.

**THE SECURITY VALUE**
Rigged security systems have varying levels of technologies' capability (or difficulty, depending on how you look at it), as well as varying levels of vigilance. (Anything from ultra-paranoia to "Shadowrunners? What are shadowrunners?") These two characteristics are measured by a system's **Technical Rating** and **Vigilance Code**. The rating and code collectively form the system's **Security Value**.

The **Technical Rating** is a numerical value, from 1 to 10, which indicates the technological sophistication of the system. A **Technical Rating 1** represents an antiquated, near-obsolete system that hasn't changed much since **CCSS** first came out. A **Technical Rating 10** represents a modern, cutting-edge system fielded with state-of-the-art components.

The **Vigilance Code** indicates the overall watchfulness and effectiveness of the security system. A facility can have the latest and greatest security equipment, but it really doesn't mean much if the company doesn't back it up with a thought-out security plan, proficiently trained security riggers, adequate technician staffing and a proactive maintenance schedule. These and other intangible factors determine the system's **Vigilance Code**.

The **Vigilance Code** is expressed as a color—Blue, Green, Amber or Red. Each color corresponds to the number of successes a rigger must achieve during each step when accessing the security system. Note that the **Vigilance Code** does not apply during rigger combat or after a rigger has taken control of a rigged security system.

**ACCESSING A SECURITY SYSTEM**
Unless a rigger can battle her way through legions of guards to access the security room where the security rigger operates (possible, but not very likely), she will have to wrest control of the security system from her opponent by accessing the network.

Unlike remote control networks, which relay information via radio transmissions, **CCSS** security networks communicate via hardwired fiber-optic communication lines and underground or embedded power cables. Therefore, **CCSS** networks are not vulnerable to **MIJI** attacks. To wrest control of a **CCSS** network away from a security rigger, an intruding rigger must tap into the hardwired network and defeat the controlling rigger in rigger combat.

This process is divided into five steps, each a Complex Action:
1. Find a hardwire access point
2. Tap into a dataline
3. Defeat encryption
4. Adjust to system protocols
5. Defeat controlling rigger in rigger combat

To perform these steps, the intruder needs the following gear:
- a remote control deck
- a rigger protocol emulation module
- a dataline tap (if necessary)
- a rigger decryption module

**STEP 1: FIND A HARDWIRE ACCESS POINT**
The rigger must find some point in the system to which he can hardwire a dataline tap (p. 243, SRII) or an **RC** deck. Most rigged systems are not accessible from outside, so the rigger will likely have to enter a protected area of the site to find such a point.

Any fixed device connected to the **CCSS** network (such as a camera, security door or gun port) can provide a valid hardwire access point. However, a dataline tap is required to access such points. Very rarely, **CCSS** systems have open slave ports scattered throughout the site to enable roving security riggers to connect **RC** decks to the network. Of course, intruders can also connect **RC** decks to such points without the need for dataline taps. However, open slave ports are heavily disguised and not usually placed in easily accessible areas.

**STEP 2: TAP INTO A DATALINE**
To tap into a dataline, an intruder rolls a number of dice equal to the dataline tap's rating plus his **Electronics Skill**. **Task Pool** dice may be used for this test. The test is made against a target number equal to the system's **Technical Rating**. The intruder manages to tap into the line if his test successes equal or exceed the successes listed for the system's **Vigilance Code** in the **Vigilance Code Criteria Table**, p. 79.

**STEP 3: DEFEAT ENCRYPTION**
Many high-security systems encrypt their remote signals and/or hardwires. If an outside rigger runs into encryption, he can use a decryption module (see **New Toys**, p. 98) and make a **Decryption Test** to decrypt the system's communications. The test uses a number of dice equal to the decryption module's rating plus the rigger's **Intelligence**. Any remaining **Task Pool** dice may be used for this test. The test target number is the system's **Technical Rating**. The intruder manages to decrypt the system's communications if his test successes equal or exceed the successes listed for the system's **Vigilance Code** in the **Vigilance Code Criteria Table**. If he fails, the security system goes on alert.

**STEP 4: ADJUST TO SYSTEM PROTOCOLS**
Not all rigged systems use the same protocols. Therefore, a rigger intent on crashing a rigged security system must find out beforehand what protocols the targeted security system uses. Once the team rigger has this knowledge, she can use the protocol emulation module installed on her **RC** deck.

To do so, the rigger must make a test using a number of dice equal to the protocol emulation module's rating plus her **Intelligence**. Any remaining **Task Pool** dice may be used for this test. The target number is the system's **Technical Rating**. The intruder adjusts to the protocols if her test successes equal or exceed the successes listed for the system's **Vigilance Code** in the **Vigilance Code Criteria Table**. If she fails, the security system goes on alert.

**STEP 5: RIGGER COMBAT**
Once the outside rigger has completed the preceding steps, he must fight the security rigger for control of the system. Because rigged systems operate through hardware rather than software, no hardening, defensive programs or intrusion countermeasures exist. The two riggers use hardware to attack each other and inflict real damage on one another. Rigger combat is conducted according to the following sequence:

**Initiative**
Each rigger rolls his rigged Initiative per the standard rules. The rigger with the highest result acts first. This roll can occur as part of the normal Combat Turn sequence. As in standard combat, a rigger acts during every tenth phase of the Combat Turn.

**Attack/Disengage**
The rigger who won the Initiative may choose to attack or disengage. Attacking requires a Complex Action.

If the rigger attacks, the opponent makes an opposed **Willpower Test**. The rigger who initiated the action may use **Control Pool** dice. However, the number of dice used may not exceed the attacker's Willpower.

The rigger who generates greater net successes on the test does (**Willpower**)L Stun damage to his or her opponent. Increase the Damage Level by 1 for every 2 successes generated. The losing rigger makes a **Body Test** to resist the damage, augmented by his or her **Control Pool** if the rigger desires. However, the number of dice used may not exceed the rigger's **Body Rating**.

If either rigger decides to disengage, he or she jacks out of the system and surrenders control to the other rigger. Disengaging is a Free Action; re-entering the system requires a Complex Action.

**Ending Combat**
Combat proceeds until one of the two riggers disengages or passes out. If the intruder manages to overcome the security rigger, the intruder can manipulate the rigged system and/or drones at will.

Additionally, the intruder gains access to all of the information that had been available to the defeated rigger. (See **Active Security Riggers**, p. 77; **Actions in a CCSS**, p. 78; and **Rigger Bonuses in a CCSS**, p. 78.)

**DECKING A RIGGED SYSTEM**
It is possible to deck into a rigged **CCSS** system, but a decker will never be able to control the system as efficiently as a rigger does (riggers interface directly into rigged systems, while deckers must modify the user interface and operating system with programs).

To deck a rigged system, a decker needs a cyberdeck outfitted with a rigger protocol emulation module (**New Toys**, p. 98) and the software to run it. The decker performs steps 1-3 for accessing a rigged system per standard rules (see **Accessing a Security System**, p. 79).

Combat between a decker and a rigger in a rigged system follows the rigger combat rules, but the following restrictions apply to the decker:
- No Matrix programs may be used.
- The decker receives a +2 modifier on all tests.
- The decker's Initiative is at -2, and he gains no dice from the deck's **Response Increase**.
- The decker has a **Control Pool** equal to one-half (rounded up) of his emulation utility's rating.
- The decker takes damage as if from non-lethal black **IC**. (See p. 49, **Virtual Realities 2.0**.)

### ADVANCED VEHICLE RULES

The following advanced rules are for **Shadowrun** players who want to add more realism and additional levels of complexity (and math!) to running their rigger character. This section offers more options for game play that cover both the everyday and extraordinary situations characters may encounter when running the shadows. Because many of these options require substantial number-crunching and character upkeep, players and gamemasters should review these rules and choose only those that will enhance their game enough to balance out the extra work required.

This section includes rules for fuel grade and consumption, rules for maintenance and overhead during missions, quality factors (how well or poorly a vehicle is built), vehicle subsystem damage, additional gunnery rules covering a vehicle's electronic footprint, more detailed remote control rules, and additional options for electronic warfare.

**VARIABLE FUEL CONSUMPTION**
A vehicle's **Economy Rating** measures how much fuel a vehicle consumes when traveling at its standard **Speed Rating**. The **Economy Rating** is expressed as kilometers traveled per unit of fuel consumed.

If a vehicle is traveling at faster than its **Speed Rating** or is engaged in vehicle combat, it consumes fuel more rapidly than during normal operations. In this case, fuel consumption is expressed as a modified **Economy Rating**, as shown on the **Economy Rating Table**, p. 82.

**RUNNING OUT OF GAS**
If a vehicle runs out of fuel, it loses speed each turn at a rate equal to its **Acceleration Rating** multiplied by 2. When the vehicle's speed reaches 0, it grinds to a halt. To determine how far the vehicle travels as it coasts to a stop, use the following formula:

$Distance = (0.75 \times starting\_speed^2) \div vehicle's\_Acceleration\_Rating$

A driver may try to coax more distance out of a coasting vehicle by making a **Vehicle Test**. For every 2 successes, the driver may extend the coasting distance by the vehicle's **Acceleration Rating**.

Unfortunately, on the last leg of his run, he cuts the altitude a little too closely and rips the underside of his fuel tank, leaking fuel across the Rocky Mountains. As Zak begins his final approach into the CAS sector at 1,000 meters per turn, the Gray Ghost's engine sputters and dies, having consumed its last drop of fuel.

The Gray Ghost has an **Acceleration Rate** of 100, so it loses speed each turn at a rate of 200 meters per turn. That means the t-bird will remain airborne for only 5 more turns. The t-bird will travel 7,500 meters before it comes to rest, as calculated with the coasting-distance formula:

$(0.75 \times 1,000^2) \div 100 = 7,500$

Unfortunately, that will put the t-bird down over some very rough badlands. A little farther past the badlands, however, lies a stretch of flat grassland, so Zak tries to coax some more distance out of the Gray Ghost.

Zak has a **Vector Thrust Skill 6**, and he allocates 3 **Control Pool** dice to the **Vehicle Test**. The Gray Ghost has a **Handling Rating** of 4. To simplify calculation, we'll assume all other modifiers cancel each other out, so the target number for the **Success Test** is 4. Zak's test generates 5 successes. The t-bird's **Acceleration** (100) multiplied by 5 equals 500, so Zak manages to make the Gray Ghost coast for 8,000 meters before it stops, rather than 7,500.

### AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS

The base **Economy Rating** for fixed-wing aircraft assumes that the aircraft is making a normal takeoff or landing. When performing shortened or vertical landings or takeoffs (**STOL, VSTOL**, or **VTOL** operations), aircraft consume more fuel than normal. During a **STOL** takeoff, for example, an aircraft burns 20 percent of its initial fuel supply. A plane that takes off carrying cargo that exceeds its **Load Rating** also consumes extra fuel. To determine how much of an aircraft's initial fuel supply remains after an aircraft performs one of these maneuvers, multiply the craft's initial fuel capacity by the appropriate multiplier on the **Flight Maneuvers Table**.

These fuel-consumption rules do not apply to helicopters, zeppelins or LAVs.

---

### FLIGHT MANEUVERS TABLE

| Maneuver                      | Multiplier |
| ----------------------------- | ---------- |
| STOL takeoff                  | .8         |
| If cargo exceeds Load Rating  | .7         |
| STOL landing                  | .9         |
| VSTOL takeoff                 | .7         |
| If cargo exceeds Load Rating  | .55        |
| VSTOL landing                 | .85        |
| VTOL takeoff                  | .6         |
| If cargo exceeds Load Rating (tilt-wing aircraft) | .4 |
| VTOL landing (tilt-wing aircraft) | .8       |

Wu Pi, a "free entrepreneur" in the Hong Kong Corporate Enclave, is delivering a shipment of chips from the remote district of Tsuen Wan to prospective clients in Vladivostok, Russia. Wu's Embraer-Dassault Mistral can perform very short takeoffs and landings (**VSTOL**), and that's a good thing, because Wu needs to take off from a small plateau nestled between some very steep mountains. He's got about 150 meters of runway—just enough for a **VSTOL** takeoff.

The Mistral has a standard fuel capacity of 2,000 liters, so the **VSTOL** takeoff will leave it with 1,600 liters of fuel (2,000 x .8). The Mistral has an **Economy Rating** of 2 km per liter, so Wu Pi will be able to travel 3,200 kilometers after taking off.

**Running Out of Gas**
If an aircraft runs out of gas, the pilot must make a **Crash Test** when the vehicle's speed falls below its **Stall Speed Rating**. If the test succeeds, the pilot makes a successful emergency landing at the end of its deceleration. The vehicle suffers 1D6 Stress Points and must resist 6L damage. However, no damage occurs to passengers or cargo.

If the **Crash Test** fails, the airplane crashes immediately. Resolve crash damage per standard rules. When calculating damage, use the aircraft's **Stall Speed** and assume the aircraft travels the distance already calculated for its deceleration.

Let's get back to the Gray Ghost. As a t-bird, the Gray Ghost has about as much aerodynamic lift as a flying brick and has a **Stall Speed** of 600 meters/turn. Its initial speed was 1,000 meters per turn, and the t-bird is losing speed at a rate of 200 meters per turn, so Zak must make a **Crash Test** two turns after running out of fuel. For this test, Zak adds 4 **Control Pool Dice** to his **Vectored Thrust Skill 6** and rolls 10 dice against a Target Number 4 (the t-bird's **Handling Rating**). The test yields 3 successes, so the Gray Ghost lands with a jolt and an ear-piercing screech—but the t-bird and Zak are both still in one piece.

**DRONES**
Drones consume fuel the entire time they are operating, even when they are not moving. Use a drone's second **Economy Rating**, called the **Idle Economy Rating**, to determine how much fuel a drone burns when in idle operation.

**FUEL GRADES**
In the current world, not all fuels are created equal. For example, gasoline is available in Regular, Plus, high-octane, Super, unleaded, decaffeinated, and so on. And jet fuel comes in even more flavors. Better fuel improves a vehicle's performance but costs more than regular fuel. Lower-grade fuel is cheaper than regular fuel but lowers performance.

To keep things simple, three grades of fuel are available in **Shadowrun**: Cheap, Regular, and Premium. Regular has no effect on a vehicle's performance or **Maintenance Cost** (see **Maintenance and Overhead**, p. 18, for more information). All vehicles are designed to use Regular-grade fuel, unless the player selects another grade. The effects of Cheap and Premium fuel are listed in the **Fuel Grade Effects Table**.

### FUEL GRADE EFFECTS TABLE

| Fuel Grade | Effects                                                          |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheap      | - Reduce Maintenance Cost by 5 percent. (Multiply initial Maintenance Cost by .95 to determine new cost.) |
|            | - Reduce Acceleration Rating by 2.                               |
|            | - Reduce vehicle's Economy by 10 percent. (Multiply original Economy Rating by .9 to determine new Economy.) |
| Premium    | - Increase Maintenance Cost by 5 percent. (Multiply initial Maintenance Cost by 1.05 to determine new cost.) |
|            | - Increase Acceleration Rating by 2.                             |
|            | - Increase vehicle's Economy by 10 percent. (Multiply original Economy Rating by 1.1 to determine new Economy.) |

**Custom Fuel Grades**
Gamemasters can also create other fuel grades if they wish. To determine the effects of other grades on the vehicle's **Maintenance Cost** and **Economy Rating**, first determine the Acceleration increase or decrease the fuel provides. As a rule of thumb, custom fuel grades should not increase or decrease Acceleration by more than 5.

| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Acceleration increase | - Increase vehicle Maintenance Cost by 2 percent for each point of Acceleration increase. |
|                       | - Increase vehicle Economy Rating by 1 percent for each point of Acceleration increase. |
| Acceleration decrease | - Decrease vehicle Maintenance Cost by 2 percent for each point of Acceleration decrease. |
|                       | - Decrease vehicle Economy Rating by 1 percent for each point of Acceleration decrease. |

**OPTEMPO RULES**
The **Maintenance and Overhead** rules (p. 18) assume that the rigger is operating his vehicle under the circumstances of a "typical" shadowrun (breaking into a reinforced corporate compound outside the city limits of a major metropolitan area such as Seattle, for example). For a rigger who undertakes other types of adventures (for example, smuggling, long-range operations, shadow trading in the Denver Front Range Free Zone and so on), players and gamemasters may choose to use the operations tempo, or "optempo," rules to calculate a rigger's maintenance, fuel and other overhead costs.

In military logistics, **optempo** is used to estimate the accrued costs for maintenance, fuel and overhead for a vehicle based on its mileage during a given period. The more mileage a vehicle accumulates (from deployments to hot spots, training exercises, and routine day-to-day use), the more fuel it burns, and the more wear-and-tear it accumulates. Conversely, a vehicle that spends most of its time sitting in the motor pool consumes virtually no fuel and requires far less maintenance than an active vehicle.

**CALCULATING OPTEMPO**
To use **optempo** rules to determine a vehicle's monthly **Maintenance Cost**, first determine the listed base price of the vehicle and all its modifications using the **Vehicle List** and the information in **Vehicle Customization**, p. 118 (not what the character actually paid). Divide that number by 20,000, rounding the value off to the nearest tenth. The result is the per-kilometer **optempo rate** of the vehicle.

To calculate the optempo cost for a particular adventure, multiply the total number of kilometers traveled by a vehicle during the adventure by the optempo rate. The final result is the optempo cost for that vehicle for that adventure.

**COMBINING OPTEMPO AND REGULAR MAINTENANCE**
Gamemasters may choose to combine the standard maintenance and overhead rules with the optempo rules using one of the following options.

**Splitting the Cost**
To "split the cost," reduce both a vehicle's monthly overhead rate and optempo mileage rate by half. The character pays half the normal monthly maintenance rate on the vehicle, whether or not he uses it during the month, and pays the optempo cost based on the kilometers driven in that month.

**Frequently Used Vehicles**
In this option, apply the optempo cost to vehicles that a character uses on a regular basis (for example, on every adventure). Use the standard overhead rate for vehicles that the character rarely uses (no more than once a month).

**Significant Mileage**
In the significant mileage option, optempo applies only to vehicles and drones that exceed a preset mileage threshold during an adventure. The gamemaster sets the mileage threshold, but may use the following suggestions as a rule of thumb: 200 kilometers per adventure for regular vehicles and 50 kilometers per adventure for drones.

Vehicles that do not exceed the threshold can be maintained by paying the standard **Maintenance Cost**.

**QUALITY FACTORS**
What Edges and Flaws are to **Shadowrun** characters, **Quality Factors** are to vehicles. They represent intangible factors in a vehicle's manufacturing process, such as attention to detail, process controls and professional workmanship, that affect a vehicle's purchase cost, performance, durability and **Maintenance Cost**.

**Quality Factors** that improve performance also increase the purchase price of a vehicle. Other factors reduce the purchase price but diminish a vehicle's performance.

Players select **Quality Factors** during the vehicle design process (see **Vehicle Design and Customization**, p. 108). The **Quality Factor** modifier is applied to the vehicle's **Mark-Up Multiplier** when the player calculates the final vehicle cost (see **Determine Final Vehicle Cost**, p. 114). Apply any appropriate special design multipliers (such as for drones or security-grade vehicles) after adding or subtracting any **Quality Factor** modifiers. A vehicle cannot take a **Quality Factor** with a negative modifier if that modifier would reduce the **Mark-Up Multiplier** below .1.

In the interest of game balance, no vehicle should be designed using more than two **Quality Factors**.

The following entries describe available **Quality Factors** and their **Mark-Up** modifiers.

**Master Workmanship**
**Modifier**: +.10 per level (maximum 3 levels)
A vehicle with the **Master Workmanship Factor** is produced with loving attention to detail and craftsmanship. Because every part of the vehicle is expertly crafted and assembled, the vehicle runs better and suffers less damage from normal wear and tear, and so has much lower maintenance costs than a comparable vehicle of its type and price range.

For every level of **Master Workmanship**, reduce the vehicle's **Maintenance Cost** by 10 percent (multiply the cost by .9). See **Maintenance and Overhead**, p. 18, for more information on vehicle maintenance costs.

**Lemon**
**Modifier**: -.15 per level (maximum 3 levels)
A **Lemon** is a poorly built and shoddily designed vehicle that costs more to maintain than it's worth.

For every level of **Lemon**, increase the **Maintenance Cost** of the vehicle by 20 percent (multiply the cost by 1.2). See **Maintenance and Overhead**, p. 18, for more information on vehicle maintenance costs.

**Ruggedness**
**Modifier**: +.50 per level (maximum 2 levels)
**Ruggedness** indicates that the vehicle is solidly built and can withstand an excessive amount of punishment from heavy use and abuse.

For every level of **Ruggedness**, a vehicle gains a -1 target modifier on **Stress Tests** (see **Stress**, p. 25).

**Fragility**
**Modifier**: -.50 per level (maximum 2 levels)
A vehicle with **Fragility** is sensitive to overuse and breaks down easily.

For every level of **Fragility**, a vehicle receives a +1 target modifier on **Stress Tests** (see **Stress**, p. 25).

**Streamlined Layout**
**Modifier**: +.25
A vehicle with **Streamlined Layout** has a well-designed engine and chassis layout, which makes working on the vehicle easier.

Characters working on a vehicle with **Streamlined Layout** receive a -1 target modifier to all **Build/Repair Tests**.

**Complex Chassis**
**Modifier**: -.30
A vehicle with a **Complex Chassis** has a poorly designed engine layout that makes work on the vehicle difficult.

Characters working on a vehicle with a **Complex Chassis** receive a +2 target modifier to all **Build/Repair Tests**.

**Custom Built**
**Modifier**: -.20
**Custom Built** vehicles have very special designs and frameworks. Consequently, modifications added later as vehicle customizations are more difficult to install. Double the parts cost and base time for all vehicle modifications installed during vehicle customization on **Custom Built** vehicles.

**Prototype Model/Used Vehicle**
**Modifier**: -.60
A **Prototype Model** vehicle is an experimental design built for evaluation and debugging. As such, it has a number of hidden surprises that won't be discovered until the vehicle is put through its paces. Similarly, a used vehicle may have hidden flaws that don't show up upon initial inspection or trial runs.

A **Prototype Model/Used Vehicle** starts out with 1D6 hidden **Stress Points**. These **Stress Points** are not revealed until Stress comes into play (either by the character pushing the limits of the vehicle or botching a **Success Test** under the **Stress Rule of One**). Gamemasters may reveal all of these hidden **Stress Points** at the first opportunity or dole them out over the course of an adventure or campaign. Once revealed, these **Stress Points** are added to the vehicle's **Stress Point** total and may be reduced normally.

**Safety Certified**
**Modifier**: +.15
A **Safety Certified** vehicle incorporates additional features and safeguards in a vehicle's design to protect passengers in the event of a crash or collision.

Any passenger or driver riding in a **Safety Certified** vehicle receives a -1 target modifier when making tests to resist Collision Damage. This modifier does not apply to vehicles resisting vehicle damage or passengers resisting damage from weapon attacks.

**Passenger Trap**
**Modifier**: -.15
A vehicle with the **Passenger Trap Quality Factor** has substandard passenger safety measures because the manufacturer has cut corners to reduce the manufacturing cost of the vehicle.

Any passenger or driver in a **Passenger Trap** receives a +1 target modifier on **Resistance Tests** made for Collision Damage. This modifier does not apply to vehicles resisting vehicle damage or passengers resisting damage from weapon attacks.

**VEHICLE SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE**
Any time a vehicle sustains Moderate or greater damage from a single source, one or more major subsystems may be damaged. To determine if subsystem damage occurs, the controlling player rolls 1D6. Subtract 4 from the roll result if the vehicle sustained Moderate damage, 3 if the vehicle sustained Serious damage, and 2 for Deadly damage. Divide the modified result by 2, rounding up. The final result is the number of potential vehicle subsystems that may have taken damage.

To determine which subsystem is damaged, roll 1D6 and consult **Table 1**, or simply choose a category from **Table 1**. Next, consult the corresponding table and roll the appropriate number of dice (or simply choose) to determine the particular subsystem that is damaged. If the damaged vehicle is not equipped with the modification or feature that results from the dice roll, consider it a "no subsystem hit" for that particular result, or the gamemaster may roll again. Finally, roll 1D6 and consult **Table 8** to determine the extent of subsystem damage. Refer to the **Subsystem Damage Notes** for explanations of specific damage results. Systems not listed in the notes appear elsewhere in this book. Design options cannot take damage.

| 1-2    | **Light Damage**. The subsystem operates at reduced efficiency. Reduce by 1 any bonuses or extra dice provided by modifications or accessories. (If a vehicle has no such bonuses or extra dice, apply a +1 target modifier to Success Tests made with the damaged device/system.) |

| 5      | **Serious Damage**. Vehicle accessories are inoperative but repairable. |
| 6      | **Deadly Damage**. Subsystem destroyed beyond repair. Accessories must be replaced completely. |

**SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE NOTES**

**Rigger Control Box**: The attack disrupts the rigger control hardware installed in the vehicle and triggers an **ASIST** backlash. The rigger must make a **Damage Resistance Test** against physical damage. The damage Power Level is equal to the Power of the vehicle's attack (after Armor reductions), and the Damage Code is the result rolled on **Table 8**.

**Handling**: The attack damages the primary vehicle control mechanisms. Increase the Handling of the vehicle by 1 for Light damage, 2 for Moderate damage and 3 for Serious damage. If the Handling sustains Deadly damage, the vehicle automatically crashes.

**Turret**: The attack damages the servo-mechanism controlling the vehicle turret (if the vehicle has more than one turret, the gamemaster may select which is damaged). Weapons fired from that turret suffer a Damage Modifier based on the results of **Table 8**. If the turret suffers Deadly damage, it is rendered inoperative and frozen in place.

**Target Acquisition System**: The attack damages key optical or electronic components relating to target-acquisition functions. Missiles, sensor-enhanced weapons and other smart weapons suffer a Damage Modifier based on the results of **Table 8**. If the target-acquisition system suffers Deadly damage, the vehicle cannot lock onto a target and is unable to fire smart weapons. "Dumb" weapons, such as rockets, cannons and firearms, are not affected. The base cost for repairing the target-acquisition system is one-half of the Parts Cost of the sensor system.

**Engine Hit**: The attack damages the engine, which in turn reduces the vehicle's Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings. For Light damage, multiply all Ratings by .9 and round down to calculate the new ratings. For Moderate damage, multiply Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings by .7 and round down to calculate the new ratings. For Serious damage, multiply Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings by .4 and round down to calculate the new ratings. If the engine suffers Deadly damage, the vehicle loses power and decelerates at a rate equal to twice its Acceleration, and the driver must make a **Crash Test**. The base cost for repairing the engine is equal to 40 percent of the vehicle's original cost plus any nuyen spent for engine customization (multiply the cost by .6).

**Fuel Tank**: The attack causes a leak in the vehicle's fuel system. For Light damage, calculate the loss rate by multiplying the fuel remaining by .01. The result is the amount of fuel that leaks each turn. For Moderate damage, calculate the loss rate by multiplying the fuel remaining by .05. For Serious damage, calculate the loss rate by multiplying the fuel remaining by .1. If the fuel tank sustains Deadly damage, it ruptures and the driver must make a **Crash Test**. (Pyromaniac gamemasters may also check to see if the destruction of the fuel tank results in an electrical fire or a fuel explosion.) The base cost for repairing the fuel tank is the vehicle's original cost multiplied by .9.

**Passenger Compartment**: The attack on the vehicle generates shrapnel in the passenger compartment. Passengers must make **Damage Resistance Tests** against physical damage. The damage Power Level is equal to half the Power of the attack against the vehicle (after armor reductions), and the Damage Code is the result rolled on **Table 8**.

**Aggravated Body Damage**: The attack seriously weakens the infrastructure of the vehicle. For Light damage, reduce the vehicle's Body by 1 (except Body 1 vehicles, which suffer no loss). For Moderate damage, reduce the vehicle's Body to one-half its value, rounded up. For Serious damage, reduce the vehicle's Body to one-third its original value, rounded up. Deadly damage to the vehicle's Body destroys the vehicle, and it automatically crashes. The base cost for repairing the vehicle's Body is equal to the vehicle's original cost multiplied by .6.

**Armor-Defeating Hit**: The attack reduces the effectiveness of the vehicle's armor. Light damage reduces the **Armor Rating** by 1. Moderate damage reduces Armor by 3, Serious damage reduces Armor by 6, and Deadly damage reduces the **Armor Rating** by 10. Armor points lost in this manner are gone for good and can be recovered only by replacing the armor. Note that this rule is separate from the **Armor Degradation** rules (p. 75, **Fields of Fire**). At the gamemaster's discretion, both sets of rules may apply.

**REPAIRING SUBSYSTEMS**
When repairing modifications and accessories, use the standard vehicle-repair procedure with the following exceptions.

To determine the cost of repair parts, first multiply the number of damage boxes by .05. Then multiply the result by the Parts Cost of the modification or accessory. The target number for the **Repair Test** is based on the level of damage (L, M, S, or D) per standard rules. The base time for repair is equal to the base time for installing the modification or accessory.

See the **Vehicle Design and Customization** (p. 118) for more information about modification and accessory Parts Costs and base times.

### ADVANCED GUNNERY RULES

The following optional rules are designed to enhance the "realism" of shooting weapons at or from vehicles.

**FOOTPRINT**
The discharge of intense, raw electrical power from a vehicle's transmitters shines like a beacon on the electromagnetic spectrum. Consequently, vehicles with strong transmitters can be easily targeted by sensor-enhanced weapons.

The **Footprint Rating** reflects this increased "visibility." The **Footprint Rating** is subtracted from the target number on tests made against a vehicle or device's **Signature**. To determine a vehicle's **Footprint**, add the **Flux Ratings** of all its transmitters (radios, remote-control decks, sensors, **ECM**), divide the result by 10 and round to the nearest whole number.

Josie Cruise is conducting reconnaissance from her van, Rough Rider. She is simultaneously operating a drone via a remote control deck (**Flux 8**) and a shortwave radio (**Flux 6**) to keep in touch with her teammates. That gives her a **Footprint Rating** of 1, calculated as follows:

`[(8 + 6) / 10] = 1.4, rounded to nearest whole number = 1`

The van's standard **Signature** is 4, so tests made against its **Signature** would use a Target Number 3.

**Reducing Footprint**
A rigger can attempt to reduce her vehicle's **Footprint Rating** by making an **Electronic Warfare Test** against a target number equal to the **Footprint Rating** + 4. A number of **Task Pool** dice may be used in this test up to the character's skill/concentration rating level. For each success, reduce the vehicle's total Flux by 1, then re-calculate the **Footprint Rating**.

Each attempt to reduce **Footprint** requires a Complex Action. Riggers may make multiple attempts, and the effects of each attempt are cumulative. However, increase the **Electronic Warfare Test** target number by 2 on each additional attempt beyond the first.

Any time an **Electronic Warfare Test** generates a result of all 1s, double the vehicle's total Flux and re-calculate the **Footprint** accordingly.

Josie Cruise wants to reduce Rough Rider's **Footprint Rating** of 1, so she uses a Complex Action and makes an **Electronic Warfare Test**. She has **Electronics 3**, so she uses 3 dice for the test. The target number is 5 (**Footprint 1** plus 4).

The test generates 3 successes, which reduces Rough Rider's total Flux from 10 to 7. Seven divided by ten and rounded to the nearest whole number yields a 1, however, so the **Footprint Rating** remains the same.

Josie then uses another Complex Action and makes another **Electronic Warfare Test**. Again her test generates 3 successes, so now the total Flux drops from 7 to 4. Four divided by 10 equals 0.4, which drops to 0 when rounded to the nearest whole number. Thus, Josie has completely eliminated Rough Rider's **Footprint**.

**BREAKING MISSILE-TARGET LOCK**
To lock onto a target and fire a missile at it, an attacking vehicle must first detect the target vehicle with a sensor-based **Perception Test** (see **Missile Combat**, p. 59). Therefore, a target that manages to break contact with an attacker's sensors can cause missile attacks against it to miss.

To break a target lock, the character controlling the target vehicle must make a **Hide Action** before the missile strikes at the end of the Combat Turn in which it is fired. (Remember that doing so requires a Complex Action.) If the **Driving Test** for the action generates a number of successes greater than or equal to the missile's **Intelligence**, the character breaks the target lock, and the missile misses.

If the **Hide Action Test** generates a number of successes lower than the missile's **Intelligence Rating**, the character doesn't shake off the missile. The character may make another attempt (assuming he has another Complex Action left before the end of the Combat Turn), but increase by 2 the number of successes required to break the target lock for each additional attempt.

**EXTENDED-RANGE MISSILES**
Some anti-air missiles and advanced surface missiles have ranges of 5 to 10 kilometers and greater. As a result, several turns may pass before such a missile reaches its target. The **Extended-Range Missile** rule provides an alternate means for tracking missile combat for such missiles.

This rule applies to any missile with an extended range greater than 2 kilometers. Under this rule, the gamemaster treats such missiles as vehicles operating with one goal: to close in on a designated target (**Accelerate**) and then collide with it (**Ram**). (See **Accelerating/Braking**, p. 45, and **Ramming**, p. 47, in **Vehicle Combat** for details.)

Use the missile's **Intelligence** for the **Driving Tests** required for these actions. All missiles have a **Handling** of 4, and their Initiative is equal to the missile's **Intelligence** plus 2D6. Anti-surface missiles have a fixed speed of 1,000 meters per turn, and anti-air missiles have a fixed speed of 5,000 meters per turn.

### ADVANCED REMOTE CONTROL RULES

The basic remote control rules in the **Drones** section provide a simple, comprehensive system for running drones. Players who want more complex drone rules can spice up their rigging repertoires with the following rules.

**PRE-PROGRAMMED DRONE COMMANDS**
Phrasing comprehensible commands for drones can consume valuable Combat Actions, and drones may misunderstand or misinterpret commands. Entering pre-programmed commands into a deck's remote control deck can solve both of these problems.

If a rigger pre-programs the various commands required for a particular maneuver, he can then utter a single, short command that his **RC** deck will send out the pre-programmed commands and automatically direct the drones to perform the action. For example, a rigger might give the command "Home," and the rigger's car, connected via the remote-control network, would automatically drive to the rigger's position by following pre-programmed commands from the deck. Alternately, a rigger could say "Pearl Harbor North," and five aerial attack drones would fly in a V-formation due north, attacking any people or vehicles they see.

To use pre-programmed commands, a remote-control deck must be equipped with **Storage Memory** as an accessory. Pre-programmed maneuvers can be as simple or as difficult as the rigger desires, but the following restrictions apply:

1.  A pre-programmed command can only cover a single, specific task. For example, if a rigger wants to have a group of drones fly in a formation in a certain direction, then change course, she must pre-program two separate commands, one for each leg of the journey. Further, commands must state the specific details of the drone's task, leaving nothing vague or open-ended. For example, if a rigger pre-programs drones to fly in formation, she must specify the type of formation (including the distance between drones), the direction of travel, the distance to be traveled and the speed.

2.  The complexity of the command, as determined by the gamemaster using the **Skill Success Table** in SRII (p. 68), cannot be greater than the remote control deck rating.

To enter a pre-programmed command into a remote-control deck, a rigger must make a **Non-Matrix Programming Test** during her preparation time before the run. The gamemaster sets the test target number, based on the command's complexity and the target numbers listed in the **Skill Success Table** (p. 68, SRII). The gamemaster should tell the player the target number before the player makes the test and give the player the option of reducing the command's complexity to lower the target number. Keep track of the number of successes achieved.

Every pre-programmed command takes up memory in the deck's storage. Calculate a command's size with the following formula:

`([Command's Complexity Target Number]^2 x 100) + Number of non-Matrix Programming Test successes = Memory Requirement in Mp`

Calculate the time required to program the command with the following formula:

`Target Number + Number of non-Matrix Programming Test successes = hours needed to program`

During a run, a rigger can activate a pre-programmed command simply by using a Free Action. The remote control deck then automatically directs the drones to act in accordance with the pre-programmed commands.

**BACK-UP CHANNELS**
Because the data-processing capability of a remote control deck is divided over three separate radio channels—the command channel, system channel and simsense channel—a rigger can reserve one of those channels as a "back-up" in case one of the other two channels goes down due to electronic warfare. If a channel has suffered degradation from **MIJI**, the rigger can choose to close down that channel and transfer the functions of the channel onto another one.

If a channel is serving as a back-up for a second channel, all actions performed on both channels suffer a +2 modifier. And because the volume of transmissions on the channels is higher, an intruder receives a -1 modifier when attempting to locate that channel (see **Signal Interception**, p. 68).

A rigger cannot move all three channels onto one frequency.

Otto Matick is using a remote control network to perform some scouting and fire support, when a jammer locates his command channel and starts jamming it. Otto decides to transfer the functions of the command channel to the system channel.

As long as Otto uses the system channel as a back-up channel for the command channel, he receives a +2 target modifier when issuing commands to drones (normally transmitted via the command channel) and directing indirect fire (normally transmitted via the system channel). Furthermore, if the jammer tries to locate Otto's system channel, he receives a -1 modifier to his target number.

**THE SERVER SYSTEM FOR CRDS**
Normally, a cranial remote deck (**CRD**) has very low transmitting power, which forces a rigger to haul around power amplifiers, either on a bulky backpack or as part of a cyberlimb (taking up precious space that could be used for cyberguns, spurs and so on).

Alternatively, a rigger may choose to configure his **CRD** as a super-subscriber to a conventional remote control deck.

In this option, the **CRD** reduces the number of drones the normal deck can control by one (since the **CRD** counts as one of the subscribers) and gives control of the remote control network to the **CRD**. The normal deck then becomes a "server" that provides auxiliary support to the **CRD**. The effective rating for the network is the rating of the **CRD** or the rating of the standard deck, whichever is lower. Options and accessories (such as **ECCM**, protocol emulation modules, **BattleTac** systems and the like) that are incorporated in either deck are both available. (Players should place the majority of remote control accessories on their server deck and as few as necessary on their **CRDs**, to save on Essence and monetary costs.)

The Range of a remote control server system is based on the **Flux** of the server deck. However, remember that the center of effect is the server, not the **CRD**. If the rigger wanders outside of the server's range, the **CRD** loses contact with the remote control network, and the rigger is dumped out of the system.

---

### ADVANCED ELECTRONIC WARFARE RULES

These advanced rules for electronic warfare are to be used for **MIJI** attempts against remote control networks (see **MIJI**, p. 69).

**RANGE AND PARTIAL MIJI ATTACKS**
Normally, a remote control network is susceptible to **MIJI** only when its remote control deck is within the range of the intruder's electronic device. However, even if the target remote control deck is outside the intruding device's range, the intruder can still make a **MIJI** attack against any of the network's drones that are inside the intruding device's range.

In such cases, resolve electronic warfare per standard rules. However, only those drones inside the intruding device's range are affected. If a drone leaves the intruding device's range, it is free from the effects of **MIJI**.

If a rigger has jumped into a drone within the range of the intruding device, the rigger is vulnerable to the effects of dump shock if the intruder dumps the rigger through a successful jamming or interference attempt.

**MIJI ON MULTIPLE CHANNELS**
If an intruder has successfully intercepted two or all three channels of a remote control system, he can try to make a simultaneous **MIJI** blitz on all intercepted channels. When making a multiple-channel **MIJI** attack, the intruder makes a normal **MIJI Test**, but applies a +3 target modifier for each additional channel the intruder is trying to blitz. In other words, an intruder receives a +3 target modifier to the **MIJI Test** if attempting to use **MIJI** on two channels simultaneously, and a +6 modifier to the **MIJI Test** if attempting to use **MIJI** on all three channels of a remote control network.

An intruder can make only one type of **MIJI** attack when making a multiple **MIJI** attempt.

**BARRAGE JAMMING**
**Barrage jamming** is a jamming technique that jams all frequency bands. When using barrage jamming, a jammer does not need to make an **Interception Test** and jams all channels (including normal radio) at the same time. On the other hand, because the jammer is spreading his electromagnetic energy across a wide range of frequencies, he has a sharply reduced range and, more important, his own device/vehicle becomes more vulnerable to detection by enemy sensor systems and smart weapons.

When employing barrage jamming, the jammer automatically jams all radio and radio-telephone communications and inflicts signal degradation on all of his opponent's **Signal Monitors**. For every 3 points of Flux used in barrage jamming, 1 box of signal degradation on all of the opponent's **Signal Monitors** are filled.

To determine the effective range of barrage jamming, use all standard ranges by 20. In other words, the range for a barrage jammer is equal to 500 meters, plus the barrage jammer's Flux multiplied by 200.

Additionally, barrage jamming reduces the **Signature** of the jammer. For every 2 points of Flux used in barrage jamming, reduce the jammer's **Signature** by 1. A jammer's **Signature** cannot fall below 2, but any excess **Signature** reductions offset any modifiers that increase the **Signature** or Signature-based target numbers.

The tactic of barrage jamming does not work with meaconing, intrusion or interference.

**HOT MIKE JAMMING**
"Hot mike" is military slang, referring to situations in which a radio transmitter overrides all other signals on a frequency, preventing other individuals from talking on that frequency and effectively jamming it. This usually results from a faulty microphone or a loose connection, but a similar effect occurs when a speaker is rude enough to interrupt another person's transmission. (When someone interrupts another person's transmission by overriding the signal, soldiers say that the interrupter "stepped on" the transmission.)

In **Shadowrun**, "hot mike" jamming is an improvised method of jamming that uses standard transmission equipment, such as radios or remote control decks, in lieu of **ECM**. "Hot mike" jamming works on both standard radio communications (see Radio Equipment, p. 184 in SRII) and remote control deck transmissions. However, when using "hot mike" jamming against remote control decks, the jammer receives a +2 target modifier on **MIJI Tests**, because the set-up of a remote control network provides partial protection against accidental transmissions.

### NEW TOYS

This section describes new weapons, drones and other accessories guaranteed to make the most jaded rigger character drool. Specific uses for many of these toys have been described in earlier chapters of this book. Rules for designing and modifying vehicles using this equipment appear in the **Vehicle Design and Customization** chapter, beginning on page 108.

The toys in this section are organized into groups by type, covering Weapons, Cyberware, Remote Control Accessories, and Drones and Robots. Each item includes a short description of the toy's creation and use in the **Shadowrun** world, followed by specific game information and rules for use in the game. The game statistics for each piece of equipment appear in a table at the bottom of each page.

Some equipment in this chapter represents new versions of equipment published in previous **Shadowrun** sourcebooks. At the gamemaster's discretion, the current versions of these pieces of equipment may remain available to his player characters, though he may choose to reduce the cost and Availability target number for his campaign. The new, revised versions of this equipment should be considered the state of the art for that equipment, and the gamemaster should set the cost and Availability at a level suitable for equipment and innovations new to the market.

**ARES VENGEANCE & VANQUISHER MINIGUNS**
The **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** series of miniguns are the heavier cousins of the popular Vindicator minigun (p. 58, **Street Samurai Catalog** or p. 279, SRII) and use the Vindicator's rotating-barrel design. The CAS army recently chose to equip its Avenger VII motorized air-defense vehicle with **Vanquishers**.

**Game Effects**
Like the Vindicator, both the **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** require 3 seconds (1 Combat Turn) of start-up time to get the barrels rotating at firing speed. Due to their high rate of fire, both the **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** have a minimum rate of fire of 6 rounds per Combat Phase. They also have a maximum autofire rate of 15 rounds per phase, instead of the standard 10 rounds per Combat Phase. The **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** follow the double-unmodified recoil rules for heavy weapons (p. 89, SRII), but mounting the miniguns on a vehicle hardpoint (see **Fixed Mounts**, p. 131) cancels out the special recoil modifier.

**Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** miniguns can make use of gyroscopic stabilization, but they cannot accept gas-vent recoil compensation. Likewise, they can accept top-mounted weapon accessories but they cannot carry barrel or under-barrel weapon accessories. **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** miniguns can be mounted on vehicle weapon mounts (see **Vehicle Weapon Mounts**, p. 131), but they cannot be mounted on ordinary bipods or tripods.

Because of their heavy mass and punishing recoil, **Vengeance** and **Vanquisher** miniguns are not man-portable.

**ARES VIGILANT & VICTORY AUTOCANNONS**
The **Vigilant** and **Victory** autocannons are vehicle-mounted, autofire versions of the standard, single-shot assault cannons. These extremely popular heavy-suppression weapons commonly are mounted on all but the lightest armored personnel carriers (**APCs**) and infantry fighting vehicles (**IFVs**).

**Game Effects**
Both the **Vigilant** and **Victory** are capable of firing in single-shot (**SS**) and fully automatic (**FA**) modes. When firing in full-automatic mode, both cannons fire a minimum burst of 6 rounds and have a maximum rate of fire of 12 rounds per phase.

The **Vigilant** and **Victory** autocannons can be mounted only on fixed hardpoints or turrets. Because they are heavy weapons, they both negate the half-recoil modifier for hardpoints (see **Fixed Mounts**, p. 131). **Vigilant** and **Victory** autocannons can accept vehicle weapons accessories but no other weapon accessories.

The **Vigilant** and **Victory** are not man-portable weapons. See **Weapon Ranges Table** on p. 107 for firing ranges.

**RUHRMETALL VOGELJÄGER MULTI-ROLE ANTI-AIR MISSILE (MRAAM)**
Produced by the Allied German States, the **Vogeljäger** (Bird Hunter) is a multi-purpose anti-aircraft missile that can be used by dismounted personnel, ground vehicles and slow-flying aircraft such as helicopters, LAVs and zeppelins. Its multi-capability and increased range makes it a vast improvement over the man-portable SAM featured in the **Street Samurai Catalog** (p. 59).

**Game Effects**
The **Vogeljäger** works only with vehicles that possess Level 2 or higher sensor systems. The man-portable variant of the **Vogeljäger** uses a launcher equipped with a Level 2 sensor unit. The man-portable sensor functions just like normal vehicle sensors, except that it has a +4 modifier for detecting objects on the ground.

When firing a **Vogeljäger** against a ground target, the attacker receives a +4 modifier to his **Gunnery Test** and the missile only inflicts 8D damage.

This missile has a range of 50 meters to 10 kilometers.

**SAAB-SAAKER AIM-11R AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE**
The "R" model is the latest in Saab-Saaker's AIM-11 series of air-to-air missiles. Like its predecessors, the AIM-11R is a short-range air interceptor weapon designed to be used with air-superiority fighters such as the Federated Boeing Eagle or the dozens of Eurofighter variants in existence around the world.

**Game Effects**
The **Saab-Saaker AIM-11R** may only be mounted on aircraft. When firing it against ground targets, the attacker receives a +4 modifier to his **Gunnery Test** and the missile only inflicts 8D damage. This missile has a range of 150 meters to 15 kilometers.

Sales of **AIM-11Rs** are tightly controlled. The gamemaster can set any Availability Rating he desires, though we recommend a target number of at least 20.

**MITSUBISHI-GM OUTLAW VEHICLE MISSILE SYSTEM**
The **Outlaw** vehicle missile system from Mitsubishi-GM is the successor to the original Bandit **AGM** system. Mitsubishi-GM will discontinue production of the Bandit beginning in the fourth quarter of 2058.

The **Outlaw** represents a radical restructuring of the Bandit system. Due to popular demand, the **Outlaw** features multi-platform capability and can be fired from air, ground and nautical vehicles. In addition, the electronics of the missile incorporate the new dual-fire mode technology. This feature enables the user to set the weapon on continuous target lock for improved strike accuracy, or on fire-and-forget shooting mode for quick engagements during evasive maneuvers.

But the most significant design change is the ordnance itself, which comes in three block versions. **Block I Outlaw** uses improved conventional munitions (**ICM**), which disperse micro-bombs when the missile is flying directly overhead its designated target or impact point. The compound detonations of the bombs do significant damage to all targets within the missile's area of effect, making **ICM** more effective against area targets than standard explosives.

**Block IA Outlaw** improves on the **ICM** concept with dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (**DP-ICM**). Instead of spherical micro-bombs, **DP-ICM** uses shaped charge explosives, oriented downwards by a training cloth streamer. The shaped-charged munitions give the bombs more penetrating power, making them effective against soft-skinned vehicles and light armor.

**Block II Outlaw** is an anti-armor missile designed to attack medium and heavy armor. On acquiring its target, **Block II Outlaw** flies directly overhead and fires its warhead into the vehicle from above, where armor is generally weakest. **Block II Outlaw** is also capable of direct fire when the target is concealed by overhead cover.

**Game Effects**
All versions of this missile have a range of 50 meters to 10 kilometers.

**Block I Outlaw (ICM)** functions as a special high-explosive missile. Instead of inflicting blast damage that diminishes in Power farther from the center of the explosion, **ICM** inflicts the same damage code on all targets within a fixed radius from the target point. The target and all characters, vehicles and other objects within a 10-meter radius must resist 14D explosive damage. This damage affects only objects within a 10-meter radius around the target. Vehicles automatically stage the damage down by one step to Serious, per the vehicle damage reduction rules (see **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**, p. 53).

**Block IA Outlaw (DP-ICM)** has the same effects as Block I, except that the shaped-charged munitions negate vehicle damage reduction. Vehicles must resist against 14D vehicle damage, but the vehicle gets the full benefit of its **Armor Rating** (this is an exception to the anti-vehicle munitions rule (see **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**).

**Block II Outlaw** behaves as a standard anti-vehicle missile and does 20D damage to the target alone. It is an armor-piercing, anti-vehicle weapon, so vehicle armor is only half as effective, and the vehicle does not reduce the Damage Code by 1 level (see **Vehicle Damage from Weapons**).

The top-attack capability of Block II is a special effect and does not affect game play.

---

### TEXTRON "TRAPDOOR" SMART MINES

The **Trapdoor** is the latest generation of wide-area munitions (**WAMs**) designed to counter an enemy force's mobility. Using seismic, acoustic, magnetic anomaly and various other types of sensors, the **Trapdoor** passively scans for hostile vehicles. Once the mine detects a target, it validates the target based on criteria pre-programmed into its internal control electronics. If the target is confirmed as friendly, the **Trapdoor** stands down.

If the **Trapdoor** identifies the target as hostile, however, the mine launches a single submunition over the target. The submunition acquires the target and fires an explosively formed penetrator (**EFP**) through the top of the target, destroying it.

Not only does this make the **Trapdoor** an effective anti-tank mine, but its "top-attack" capability makes the **Trapdoor** equally effective in downing helicopters and LAVs flying at an altitude of less than 100 meters.

In addition to static placement, the **Trapdoor** may be deployed via rocket-artillery self-contained anti-armor mine systems (**RASCAM**). The **RASCAM** is compatible with both standard vehicle rocket launchers and the **Outlaw VMS** system (p. 93).

**Game Effects**
The **Trapdoor** smart mine is a stationary weapon system that consists of three parts: a **Rating 4** sensor, a **Rating 2 Pilot**, and three submunitions.

The **Trapdoor** uses its sensor to search for targets within its 500-meter scanning range. When it finds a target, the Pilot determines whether or not that target is friendly, based on pre-programmed criteria. The criteria can be anything its user wishes, within the limits of what the mine can comprehend.

During programming, the mine makes a **Comprehension Test** against the user's criteria (see **Issuing Commands**, p. 66). The gamemaster should tell the player the target number for the test and give him the option to downgrade the criteria. Programming a **Trapdoor** mine requires one Complex Action.

If the target is hostile, the mine launches one submunition into the air. Make a **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test** (see **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery**, p. 58), using the mine's **Pilot Rating** in place of the **Gunnery Skill**. The submunition has a Damage Code of 14D and is an anti-vehicle, armor-piercing submunition (which means that the vehicle does not reduce the Damage Level by 1 and can use only half of its **Armor Rating**, rounded down, to reduce the submunition's Power).

Trapdoors may be deployed manually or via a **RASCAM** rocket. A **RASCAM** rocket holds eight mines. When placing mines, make an **Indirect Fire Test** (p. 60). The location determined by the test (after accounting for scatter direction and distance) is the center of effect. The mines deploy in an octagonal pattern for 50 meters around the center of effect.

**LORAL-VOUGHT "ZAPPER" STATIC DISCHARGE ROCKETS**
The "**Zapper**" static-discharge rocket is a specialized weapon used against drones. Rather than a high-explosive warhead, the zapper carries an electrically charged dielectric, encased in alternating layers of conductive metal and ceramic insulation. On impact, the warhead acts as a giant capacitor and discharges a massive electrical surge into the drone, causing its circuitry to burn out.

One controversial side-effect of the zapper is that, as it burns out the simsense circuitry in a drone, it creates a backlash of garbled **ASIST** signals and spikes that affect the controlling rigger. These **ASIST** backlashes often cause convulsions and fatal strokes or aneurysms in riggers. The United Nations is currently debating whether to include zappers among the list of banned "cruelty" weapons, alongside land mines, blinding lasers and chemical-biological weapons.

**Game Effects**
Zapper warheads behave as normal anti-vehicle rockets, with one exception. In addition to damaging the vehicle, the electrical discharge also creates a disruptive simsense signal that affects riggers and other characters controlling the vehicle cybernetically, either by being jacked into the vehicle or directly controlling it through a remote control deck.

If the rocket does damage to the drone, the rigger must make a **Willpower Test** to resist Physical damage. The Power of the attack is 7 plus the rating of the rigger's **VCR** implant (the more wired the brain is, the more susceptible it is to damage). The Damage Level is one step higher than the Damage Level sustained by the vehicle from the attack. (For example, if the vehicle suffered Light damage, the rigger must resist Moderate damage, and so on.) If the rigger is controlling the vehicle by remote control, apply a -2 modifier to this test, because the deck absorbs some of the effects.

Non-riggers controlling a vehicle cybernetically, as well as riggers using the captain's chair mode (see **Operative Modes**, p. 65 in **Drones**), do not suffer as severely as riggers directly controlling a vehicle. In these circumstances, the character receives Stun damage, not Physical damage. See p. 107 for firing ranges.

**LORAL-VOUGHT "JABBERWOCKY" JAMMER MUNITIONS**
The **Jabberwocky** adds a new twist to the phrase "electronic warfare." Instead of an explosive warhead, the **Jabberwocky** disperses electronic transponders that jam sensors, voice radio and digital transmission systems. Jamming transponders may be set to activate on dispersal, after a pre-set time delay or upon detection of transmission signals within the area of effect.

**Game Effects**
Jammer rockets and missiles behave as standard rockets or missiles until impact. On impact, the missile scatters jamming transponders that may jam sensors (as **ECM**), radio communications, or remote-control transmissions (the type is pre-determined when purchasing the munition and cannot be changed after the fact). Anti-sensor jammers act as Level 4 **ECM** (see **Electronic Countermeasures**, p. 31), while anti-remote jammers act as Level 4 jammers (see **Jamming**, p. 71).

The transponders affect a circular area with a radius equal to 50 meters plus 3D6 times half the number of successes generated on the **Gunnery Test**, rounded up (50 + [3D6 x (Gunnery Test successes + 1/2)]). The transponders have a **Flux** of 6 for resolving electronic warfare results, but they do not affect transmissions outside the area of effect. Jamming from **Jabberwocky** transponders affects all transmissions of the transponder's type, whether friend or foe.

**Jabberwocky** munitions may be fired only from vehicle weapon mounts. See p. 107 for firing ranges.

**LORAL-VOUGHT "SILENCER" ADVANCED ANTI-RADIATION MUNITIONS (AARM)**
Loral-Vought's **Silencer** series of munitions are an advanced version of the high-speed anti-radiation missiles (**HARMs**) of the previous century. Officially designated as advanced anti-radiation munitions (**AARMs**), **Silencers** lock onto the emissions of sensor systems as well as anti-sensor **ECM**.

**Game Effects**
**AARMs** behave according to the missile combat rules on page 59, with one exception. Rather than using the opposing vehicle's **Signature** as a target number, the **AARM** target number is equal to 12 divided by the highest active **Flux Rating** from the target vehicle's Sensors or **ECM** (rounded down). The target number cannot drop below 1. **AARMs** are vehicle missiles and can be fired from vehicle weapon mounts only. The **Silencer** has a range of 50 meters to 12 kilometers.

### CYBERWARE

**CRANIAL REMOTE DECKS**
Cranial remote decks (**CRDs**) represent a long-awaited revolution in rigger technology. Incorporating some of the computer and microtronic advances used in cranial cyberdecks for the past six years, the rigger carries the miniaturized cranial remote deck in his head, freeing the rigger from a fixed station and giving him mobility within his network's area of coverage. **CRDs** also use ESCmitre's modular hardware architecture, providing **CRDs** with the operational flexibility of desktop systems.

**Game Effects**
Using a cranial remote deck (**CRD**) is the same as using a normal remote control deck, except that cranial remote decks have a **Flux Rating** of 0, due to their small size. If a rigger wishes to increase a **CRD's** transmission power, he must connect the **CRD** to an external signal amplifier. **CRD** power boosters and signal amplifiers can be mounted on backpacks, and a few of them can even be incorporated into cyberlimbs.

The table on page 96 provides statistics for the cranial remote deck, as well as all deck accessories also available in **CRD** form (see **Remote Control Accessories**, p. 97). Riggers with **CRDs** may use headware memory (p. 247, SRII) for the same purposes as remote control storage memory.

**CYBERLIMB SIGNAL BOOSTERS**
Cyberlimb signal boosters consist of high-power relays and signal amplifiers stored inside a cyberlimb. They amplify the signals of transmitters such as headware radios and cranial remote decks, thus increasing the transmitter's effective range and resistance to electronic warfare. Signal boosters function for 24 hours before requiring recharging.

**Game Effects**
Cyberlimb signal boosters increase the **Flux Rating** of a cranial remote deck or headware radio by the booster's rating. A signal booster installed into a cyberlimb takes up all the available accessory space in a limb. No other accessory, including increased Strength or Quickness, may be installed in the cyberlimb.

Signal boosters are available in Ratings from 1 to 10. If a rigger has both a **CRD** and a cybernetic radio, only one device can draw power from the signal booster at a time.

**SNAKE-EYES REMOTE INTERFACE LINK**
Snake-Eyes integrates cybersensory systems with the interconnectivity of the remote control net. Snake-Eyes allows a cyber-enhanced user to transmit real-time audio/visual data to a remote control deck and receive simsense from other remotes. A **BattleTac FDDM** cyberware extension module is now available for the Snake-Eyes, which brings unit communications to a new level.

**Game Effects**
The **Snake-Eyes** interface link allows a rigger to see and hear everything that a cyber-enhanced character sees or hears. The rigger can also communicate with the character through the interface, but she has no control over the character's actions. A character connected to a remote control network via the **Snake-Eyes** link counts against the remote control deck as one drone, thus reducing the number of drones the deck can actively control.

The remote interface link also allows the rigger to send simsense data from another drone to the character. The character can see, hear and perceive anything that the drone perceives. The character can terminate the interface with the drone, but he cannot connect to another drone without petitioning the rigger first.

Keep in mind that the interface link does not enable the cyber-enhanced character to directly control drones or issue commands to them; that is the rigger's prerogative. The rigger running the network must grant permission for the character to perceive through a drone, and the rigger has the authority to change or terminate a connection.

The **Snake-Eyes** system requires the user to possess a minimum of **Commlink II** (p. 76, **Street Samurai Catalog**, or p. 246, SRII), cybereyes and cyberears. The **Snake-Eyes** system interfaces with the remote control net through the simsense and system channels (which occupy two of the commlink channels).

**Snake-Eyes FDDM Module**
The **Snake-Eyes FDDM module** is an additional accessory for the remote interface link. With this **FDDM** module, the connected character can transmit target data to other drones and call for attacks on targets using indirect fire (see **Indirect Fire**, p. 60).

### ACCESSORIES

**REMOTE CONTROL DECK**
The introduction of ESCmitre's new modular hardware system has breathed new life into the old rigger standby. The modular system allows a rigger to attach additional accessories, such as storage memory, protocol emulation modules and the new **BattleTac** drone applications, to his main system deck. In addition, due to the increasing demand for cybernetically controlled decks, all remote control decks produced beginning in the late 2058 model year will feature datajack links exclusively; remote control decks with video screens and manual controls will be phased out.

**Game Effects**
This deck is the same as the basic remote control deck (abbreviated as **RC** deck) listed on page 253, SRII. Note that current editions are strictly cybernetically controlled, which requires the user to possess at least a datajack.

The rating of the deck equals the maximum number of drones a deck can actively manage at any one time. Remote control decks have a starting **Flux Rating** of 2.

For more information on how to operate remote control decks, see **Remote Control Networks**, page 62.

**BATTLETACTM IVIS**
The success of the **BattleTac™** system has resulted in two new variants now available for remote control systems: **BattleTac IVIS** and **BattleTac FDDM**. **IVIS** stands for Inter-Vehicle Information System and enhances the data-sharing capabilities between the remote control deck and drones. By improving information-sharing, these systems enable drones to execute more complex and sophisticated tactics to accomplish their assigned tasks.

**Game Effects**
In game terms, **BattleTac IVIS** does one of two things: it provides extra dice for a drone's **Comprehension Test**, or it creates a dice pool, known as the **IVIS Pool**, that can be used for tests made by drones. To use the **IVIS** system, the remote control deck or **CRD** must carry the master unit as an accessory. In addition, only drones whose pilots have been modified to interact with **BattleTac IVIS** receive the benefits of this system. For more information, see **The BattleTac IVIS System**, page 67.

**BATTLETACTM FDDM**
The **BattleTac FDDM** (Fire Direction Data Manager) is the second spin-off from the **BattleTac™** information system. The **FDDM** system enables one drone to act as a spotter, relaying targeting data to other drones via the remote control network. This allows drones that cannot "see" the target to fire on it.

**Game Effects**
The **BattleTac FDDM** system allows one drone to fire its weapons at a target detected by another. The remote control deck must carry the master unit as an accessory. Both the spotting drone and the firing drone must be adapted for the **BattleTac FDDM**. For more information, see **Indirect Fire**, page 60.

**REMOTE CONTROL ENCRYPTION MODULE (RCEM)**
Though remote control decks hop from frequency to frequency to maintain signal security, signals are still occasionally intercepted. To guard against this, the remote control encryption module provides an added layer of communications security by encoding and decoding the digital signals in a secure routine. However, because of the special digital nature of **MSST** protocol, normal crypto circuit routines (p. 77, **Street Samurai Catalog**) are incompatible with remote control decks.

Remote control encryption module encryption routines comply with both government (the NSA) and corporate (ITCC) regulations.

**Game Effects**
The remote control encryption module (**RCEM**) encodes and decodes remote control signal transmissions, making them indecipherable to intruders who intercept a remote control channel. Only rigger decryption modules (see below) can break the encryption of **RCEMs**. Data codebreakers (p. 243, SRII) and Scramble Breaker **HDs** (p. 81, **Street Samurai Catalog**) are ineffective against **RCEM** encryptions, because the **RCEM** uses entirely different encryption routines.

Remote control encryption modules are available in ratings of 1 through 10. For more information on using **RCEMs**, see **Signal Interception**, page 68.

**RIGGER DECRYPTION MODULE**
The rigger decryption module is a diagnostic tool used by security riggers. This module's firmware contains sophisticated cryptographic routines that enable a user to test the encryption of his rigged security systems and drones. The external version of this module is mounted in-line between the rigger's system-control-rig dataport and the system undergoing diagnostics. Remote systems require the internal model, which must be installed inside the **RCD**. The higher-rated the module, the more protocols programmed into its firmware, up to a maximum rating of 8.

**Game Effects**
The rigger decryption module decodes encryption routines used by the **RCEM** (see above) or by **CCSS** security systems. It is available in Ratings 1 through 8. For more information on using rigger decryption modules, see **Signal Interception**, page 68, and **Defeating Deck Encryption**, page 69.

**REMOTE CONTROL ECCM**
**ECCM**, or electronic counter-countermeasures, use noise filters and signal-gain amplifiers to increase the clarity of remote control transmissions. **ECCM** defends the integrity of a remote control network from outside noise, whether due to external solar activity or wanton jamming by a hostile intruder.

**Game Effects**
Remote control **ECCM** reduces the effects of **MIJI** attacks against a remote control channel. Because it uses electrical power to filter out garbage and boost valid signals, **ECCM** reduces the **Flux Rating** of the remote control deck when active. For more information on using **ECCM** and its effects, see **Sensor and Remote Deck Ranges**, page 30, and **Regenerating MIJI Degradation**, page 72.

Vehicle **ECCM** (see **ECM**, p. 31) can also be used to counteract **MIJI**. However, remote control **ECCM** does not have any effect against sensor **ECM**.

**RIGGER PROTOCOL EMULATION MODULE**
The rigger protocol emulation module is an important tool for security riggers who perform their own diagnostics. The module allows a rigger to emulate many of the various protocols, including **CCSS**, used on contemporary rigged security systems and drones. The external version of this module is mounted in-line between the rigger's system-control-rig dataport and the system undergoing diagnostics. Remote systems require the internal model, which must be installed inside the **RC** deck. The higher-rated the module, the more protocols are programmed into its firmware, up to a maximum rating of 10.

**Game Effects**
The rigger protocol emulation module is necessary for intercepting and "hijacking" a rigged security system. It is also used for conducting meaconing, intrusion, and interference attempts against a remote control network. For more information, see **MIJI**, page 69, and **Adjust to System Protocols**, page 80.

**SIGNAL AMPLIFIERS**
Remote control decks have a fixed power supply, which in turn gives them limited ranges and limited resistance to electronic warfare. Signal amplifiers are useful accessories that boost the electromagnetic power available for transmission, increasing a remote control deck's effective range and making it less vulnerable.

**Game Effects**
Signal amplifiers increase a remote control deck's **Flux Rating**, which increases the effective range of a remote control deck and makes it more resistant to electronic warfare. For more information, see **Sensor and Remote Deck Ranges**, page 30, and **MIJI**, page 69.

In the interests of game balance, gamemasters should restrict available signal amplifiers to Ratings of 1 through 10. The maximum number of jacks a remote control deck can handle is equal to its rating.

**AUDIO/VISUAL SCREEN DISPLAYS**
With the shift to full cybernetic controls, screen displays are necessary for displaying real-time footage to other people. The audio/visual screen displays use the latest in miniaturized multimedia technology to convey video feeds as well as real-time sound recordings of events being observed by a drone.

**Game Effects**
These 11-inch LCD screen attachments display the rigger's point of view from the remote control network. The screens also enable a rigger to communicate with viewers, either by voice or by typing text. Viewers, however, cannot talk back, unless the remote control deck is equipped with an intercom.

A rigger can also connect multiple screens to a remote control deck so that each screen displays a single drone's point of view. The maximum number of screens that may be connected to a remote control deck is equal to the deck's rating.

**REMOTE CONTROL STORAGE MEMORY**
Storage memory is just as important for remote control decks as it is for cyberdecks. Without storage memory, how could a rigger record the images being received from the drones under her control? It is a foolish rigger who deploys her drones without storage memory to record the results.

**HITCHER JACKS**
The success of cyberdeck hitcher jacks prompted the development of hitcher jacks for remote control decks. These accessories enable a second individual to plug into a rigger's network, providing a second set of eyes to watch the operation and increase awareness of the remote control operation.

**Game Effects**
Hitcher jacks for remote control decks work the same way as they do for cyberdecks. They allow other characters to perceive everything the rigger sees and does. If the rigger is in captain's chair mode, so is the observer; if the rigger is directly controlling a drone, the observer perceives only the signals from that drone.

Hitcher jacks also allow an observer to communicate with the rigger, but they do not provide the observer with any control over the operation.

**INTERCOM SPEAKER**
An often overlooked accessory to any remote control network is a two-way intercom. This minor yet important device facilitates communication between the rigger and onlookers. Additionally, the speaker has a port that enables any voice radio to be connected to the intercom.

**Game Effects**
The intercom speaker allows two-way communication between the rigger and people within close proximity to the remote control deck. Without an intercom speaker, a rigger has to focus attention on her meat body to speak with her own vocal cords. (Doing so requires a Complex Action and imposes a +8 modifier to all actions taken while the rigger is speaking.)

---

### AUTOSOFTS

**TAPS SHARPSHOOTER AUTOSOFT**
TAPS stands for target-acquisition processing system. The **TAPS Sharpshooter** is a target acquisition and gunnery expert program that enables drones to fire more accurately. This accessory allows a rigger to mass more effective firepower without the need for direct involvement in every step of the attack.

**Game Effects**
**TAPS Sharpshooter** adds its rating to the drone's **Pilot Rating** for all **Gunnery Tests** made with the drone. This autosoft may not be used while a rigger is directly controlling the drone. The **TAPS Sharpshooter** is available in Ratings 1-5.

**IPA CLEARSIGHT AUTOSOFT**
ClearSight IPA makes use of the latest imagery-analysis expert systems available from the intelligence community. This accessory allows a rigger to identify a fuzzy image in mid-run—rather than later suffering the consequences of ignorance.

**Game Effects**
**IPA ClearSight** adds its rating to the drone's **Pilot Rating** for **Perception Tests** made with the drone. Additionally, a rigger can use it in conjunction with her own Intelligence for general **Perception Tests**. In this case, the **ClearSight Rating** may not exceed the rigger's **Intelligence Rating**.

**IPA ClearSight** may not be used for any combat-related **Success Tests**. The **IPA ClearSight** is available in Ratings 1-5.

---

### DRONES AND ROBOTS

**AEROQUIP "REDBALL EXPRESS" LONG-RANGE RESUPPLY DRONE**
The "**Redball Express**" is a large drone designed for transporting supplies and equipment. Under contract to the CAS army, Aeroquip designed the **Redball Express** as a means of delivering ammunition, electronics and other supplies in small quantities to CAS special forces troopers deep behind enemy lines.

The **Redball Express** is an unmanned aerial vehicle with twin tilt-wing jet engines. The tilt-wings allow it to perform standard take-offs from a friendly launch site (thus conserving fuel) and perform near-vertical landings in tactical areas, where landing space is at a premium.

**AERODESIGN SYSTEMS CONDOR LDSD-23 & CONDOR II LDSD-41**
The **Condor** and **Condor II** are state-of-the-art, lighter-than-air drones that are the unquestioned leaders in the field of reconnaissance, electronic intelligence-gathering (**ELINT**) and electronic warfare. Constructed entirely of sensor-transparent and near-light-transparent materials, Condors are almost impossible to detect.

The **Condor LDSD-23** is a solar-powered drone filled with hydrogen for greater lifting capacity. For night-time operations, the drone features long-life rechargeable batteries that can keep the drone running for eight to twelve hours. The **Condor** also features nonmetallic electrical conductors to help reduce its radar signature, as well as solar-electric ducted turboprops for propulsion.

The **Condor II** uses the popular **SHAPELY** (SHAped Airfoil Positive Enhanced Lift) equipment for enhanced lift, which further reduces the drone's fuel consumption. The **Condor II** also replaces the original Condor's solar cells with extended-duration batteries.

**ARES ARMS SENTRY II**
An improved version of the original Sentry system, the **Sentry II** incorporates the latest in drone technology advances. Features include an **MSST** transceiver, which allows the **Sentry II** to interface with any remote control network. Additionally, the system's remote control adaptor enables the **Sentry II** to take advantage of **BattleTac IVIS**, which can multiply the firepower of the system when more than one **Sentry II** system is used.

**Game Effects**
The **Sentry II** is a portable automated weapons stand that behaves like a drone. Because it is immobile, the **Sentry II** "drone" has a Speed of 0 and uses standard combat rules rather than vehicle combat rules.

**AZTECHNOLOGY HEDGEHOG SIGNAL INTERCEPTOR**
The **Hedgehog** signal interceptor drone is a signal-intercept and precision-emitter location system that intercepts and identifies opposing command, control, communications and intelligence (**C3I**) transmitters. Leap-ahead technology exploits communications intelligence and signal intelligence to provide the user with vital electronic information about his opponent. In addition, the low profile offered by the small drone allows deep penetration into otherwise secure areas.

**Game Effects**
The ability to intercept enemy voice and data transmissions via electronic intelligence, or **ELINT**, during a pre-run recon and real-time during ops can give the rigger and his team a significant advantage over the opposition.

Exploiting signal intelligence can tell you if your enemy is using encryption, what kind of protocols they use for data transmissions, signal strength and so on. If signal intelligence is handled correctly, a rigger can determine the location of the other side's central command center, the kind of sensor systems they are using, where they do and do not scan frequently, whether they use drones and **CCSS** and so on.

**AZTECHNOLOGY GCR-23C CRAWLER**
A tracked drone based on a chassis the size of a large bread box, the **Crawler** is designed to operate as a remote snooper in rough and urban terrain. Though slow moving, it is capable of negotiating slopes of angles up to 45 degrees and has a special stair-climbing mode. Fully electric powered, it can operate in mobile mode for four hours on a standard charge and will plug itself into any power source at the designated surveillance site. When the drone is in stationary mode, its sensors can operate for 24 hours on a full charge. A standard sensor package is included in the purchase price.

**IWS DLK MK 6 UTILITY MACHINE**
The Integrated Weapon Systems (**IWS**) **DLK Mk 6** is a remarkably versatile multi-purpose drone used for maintenance, repair, work floor delivery and other menial support functions in industrial applications, particularly applications in environments hazardous to normal metahuman workers. The **DLK's** most noteworthy feature is its two mechanical limbs that end in the drone's distinctive "claw-and-suction cup" design. The claw uses the utilitarian starfish design and is rated for lifting weights up to 75 kilograms. The suction cup is actually a modular receptacle for a number of different fittings and can also function as a data transport. This modularity makes the **DLK Mk 6** a common sight throughout factories in the United Kingdom.

**CITROËN BROUILLARD SMOKE GENERATOR**
The **Brouillard** provides continuous, wide-area smoke coverage. Unlike the so-called vehicle smoke generator system offered by Ares Arms, the **Brouillard** uses an electric burner instead of a smoke-grenade dispenser, which enables the **Brouillard** to operate for up to an hour without refueling. Additionally, the generator includes a special infrared screening module, which disseminates graphite particles within the smoke, providing up to 20 minutes of infrared smoke screening.

**Game Effects**
When stationary, the **Brouillard** produces a cloud of smoke with a diameter of 150 meters and a height of 10 meters. When moving, the smoke billows from the generator in a conic dispersal pattern, forming a 100 by 250 by 10 meter trailing dome. Anything inside the cloud is obscured by heavy smoke (use the **Heavy Smoke Modifier** on p. 89, SRII, for **Perception Tests** made to detect anything inside the cloud). When the infrared screening module is in use, treat the smoke as thermal smoke as well.

The smoke cloud lasts as long as the smoke generator has smoke fuel. Once the generator shuts off (whether from the operator switching it off or the generator running out of fuel), the dome begins to dissipate, turning into a light smokescreen after 4 Combat Turns and dissipating completely after 8 Combat Turns.

The smoke generator consumes fuel at a rate of four liters per minute for regular fog oil or two liters per minute for graphite infrared smoke.

**CYBERSPACE DESIGNS WOLFHOUND ADVANCED RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT**
The company that brought you the **Dalmatian** reconnaissance unmanned aerial vehicle (**UAV**) now introduces its follow-up, the **Wolfhound**. Using recent developments in robotic learning technology, the **Wolfhound** employs an improved pilot system that can adapt its tactics to avoid detection. Additionally, the **Wolfhound** features improved aerodynamic streamlining and increased fuel capacity to provide longer flight time.

**FMC-STONEBROOKE TADS-SERIES DRONES**
The **TADS** (target acquisition and designation system) series of drones use the recently released **BattleTac FDDM** firmware to identify and mark targets for other vehicles to engage. So far, FMC-Stonebrooke has produced two drone models under its **TADS** line: the **TADS Firebird** and **TADS Salamander**.

The **TADS Firebird** consists of a simple fixed-wing **UAV** chassis fitted with an advanced sensor package that includes a **BattleTac FDDM** plug-in accessory. The **TADS Salamander** consists of a rugged, compact tracked vehicle chassis fitted with sensors and target-designator firmware.

FMC-Stonebrooke plans to release a third **TADS** vehicle, the waterborne **TADS Hydra**, in the fourth quarter of 2058.

**GTE-FORD RETRANS UNIT**
Produced under a joint partnership between GTE Telecommunications and Ford Motor Company, the mobile retransmission unit (more commonly known as a "retrans unit") extends a remote control network's effective area. The retrans unit intercepts signals from the remote control deck and retransmits them on a separate frequency to other drones. By placing a retrans unit on the edge of a remote control deck's transmission range, the unit can effectively double the distance at which a drone can operate away from the remote control deck.

**Game Effects**
The retrans unit is a communications drone that relays transmissions from a remote control deck to drones outside the deck's transmission range and vice versa. To calculate the extended transmission range during normal operation, add the **Flux Rating** from the drone's retrans device to the **Flux Rating** of the remote control deck, then consult the **Flux Rating and Range Table**, p. 30.

During electronic warfare, however, the **Flux Ratings** remain separate. Do not add the **Flux Rating** of the retrans device to the remote control deck's Flux when resolving **MIJI** attacks (see p. 69).

**MCT-NISSAN ROTO-DRONE**
While other manufacturers are producing expensive, devices, Mitsuhama and Nissan apparently have taken the opposite direction with the roto-drone, eschewing flashy, complicated features in favor of a "simpler-is-better" design. The drone's standard sensor suite, excellent handling and large fuel tank give it the versatility and flexibility to handle any number of missions. Additionally, the superior lift offered by its helicopter flight emulation allows users to customize the drone for specific tasks.

**MESAMETRIC KODIAK ROADWAY CLEARANCE SYSTEM**
Chartered last year in the Sioux Nation, the Mesametric company makes its marketplace debut with the **Kodiak**, a heavy-construction drone. Originally designed to perform mobility, countermobility and survivability operations for Sioux army combat engineers, the **Kodiak** is being offered for public sale to construction companies and government public works offices.

**Game Effects**
Among other creative uses players can think up, the bulldozer blade on the **Kodiak** may be used to break through barriers and clear paths through minefields. When doing so, treat the drone as having effective **Body** and **Armor Ratings** of 6 and 18, respectively, when resisting damage from breaking through walls or engaging mines. Additionally, the barrier collapses when the **Barrier Rating** is less than half the Power of the collision, instead of twice the Power (per standard rules).

The mechanical shovel can dig a hole up to a half-meter wide, two meters long and one meter deep in a Combat Turn and can remove two cubic meters of dirt or debris per turn. Doing so forfeits all subsequent actions for the drone during the remainder of the Combat Turn.

**PRATT & WHITNEY SUNDOWNER AERIAL SPRAYER**
The **Sundowner** is an unmanned aircraft equipped with a sprayer. Its simple chassis, combined with the sprayer, makes it appealing to agricultural businesses and corporate farms. The design gained notoriety recently when Ares Macrotechnology used several Sundowners to disperse the Strain III virus over the Chicago Containment Zone.

**Game Effects**
The **Sundowner** possesses a sprayer capable of delivering any liquid or gas in mist form. The sprayer can dispense a mist cloud 25 x 25 x 10 cubic meters in dimension. Doing so spends one Complex Action. Approximately one liter of liquid is needed to create a mist cloud.

**RENRAKU ARACHNOID MINI-DRONE**
Renraku's **Arachnoid** measures seventeen centimeters long. Useful for accessing extremely confined areas, the drone's spider-like chassis and extended-life rechargeable battery make it rugged and versatile enough to go anywhere. In response to recent advances by its competitors, Renraku has begun producing drones in additional insect shapes.

**Game Effects**
The **Arachnoid** has a **Body Rating** of 0, which means that any hit by any weapon of any size automatically destroys it. The **Arachnoid's** sensors have a fixed **Flux Rating** of 0.

**SAAB-THYSSEN BLOODHOUND**
Jointly produced by Saab of Sweden and Thyssen Henschel Motorwerk in Germany, the **Bloodhound** is a **HAZMAT** (hazardous materials) drone designed to identify, survey and mark areas contaminated by radiation, biological hazards or chemical contamination. Supplementing its superb sensor array are several sophisticated gas and chemical spectrometers.

The **Bloodhound** also contains a small storage area for collecting contamination samples and a simple sprayer for decontaminating itself and other small pieces of equipment.

**Game Effects**
The **Bloodhound's** sensor systems come with spectrometers and radiacmeters capable of detecting chemical/biological/radiation emissions, contaminations and anomalies. The **Bloodhound's** sensors have a fixed range of 10 meters.

To detect the presence of specific chemicals, micro-bioforms or radiation, the controlling player makes a **Sensor Perception Test**. The target number is left up to the gamemaster, based on the type of material, its concentration, how unique it is and so on. Use the **Knowledge Skill Table** (p. 183, SRII) to determine the results of the test.

The **Bloodhound's** liquid sprayer can spray any liquid on the drone or another object within one meter of the **Bloodhound**. The sprayer has an internal storage capacity of 10 liters.

**SHIAWASE KANMUSHI MECHANICAL CRAWLER**
Shiawase enters the world of remotely controlled vehicles with the 10-centimeter **Kanmushi** ("Beetle") mechanical crawler. Taking advantage of "smart materials" technology, Shiawase breaks the "six-inch limit" that has long plagued manufacturers of small-scale drones. The **Kanmushi** represents a deliberate effort by Shiawase to appropriate the market currently dominated by Renraku, and that company confidently expects its drone to quickly supplant the **Arachnoid** as the preferred drone for penetrating closely confined areas.

**Game Effects**
The **Kanmushi** has a **Body Rating** of 0, which means that any hit by any weapon of any size automatically destroys it. The **Kanmushi's** sensors have a fixed **Flux Rating** of 0.

**SIKORSKY-BELL MICROSKIMMER II**
The **Microskimmer II** is a saucer-shaped air-cushion vehicle (**ACV**) drone, similar in size and shape to a standard trash can. The **Microskimmer II** addresses several design problems in the original Microskimmer, such as the original skimmer's tendency to sink when stationary over water. Additionally, the **Microskimmer II** incorporates several new features, such as limited vector-thrust flight capability, submerged operation mode and an expanded load capacity.

**Game Effects**
Because of its multi-role capability, the **Microskimmer II** uses two types of engines. When operating as a hovercraft or vector-thrust aircraft, the drone uses a methane combustion engine. When operating underwater, the drone uses an electric engine. Because the Microskimmer has two engines, it also has two **Signature, Economy** and **Fuel Ratings**. The first set of ratings represents the methane engine. The second represents the electric engine.

The **Microskimmer II** has a maximum flight altitude of 1.5 meters. The limited thrust of its vector-thrust engines prevents it from flying any higher. The drone can operate underwater down to a maximum depth of 0.5 meters. Below 0.5 meters, however, the water pressure crushes its hull and the **Microskimmer** sinks.

**TOYOTA MK-GUYVER SEARCH AND RESCUE ROBOT**
The **MK-Guyver** is the first drone to take advantage of new robotic self-learning technology. Its ability to adjust its programming in response to unexpected circumstances makes it a top-notch performer for search and rescue in perilous environments.

The **MK-Guyver** moves by means of tracks, but it also possesses auxiliary legs for movement over rough and uneven terrain. It has two mechanical arms with modular fittings and an acetylene blowtorch for cutting through rubble or barriers.

**Game Effects**
Because the **MK-Guyver** has two methods of movement, it has two **Speed** and **Acceleration** ratings. The first number indicates its Speed and Acceleration when using tracks. The second number indicates its ratings when using mechanical legs. Remember that a drone obeys standard combat rules instead of vehicle combat rules when propelled by mechanical legs (see **Mechanical Legs**, p. 35).

### VEHICLE DESIGN & CUSTOMIZATION

Like a magician's spells, a rigger's vehicles and drones give the rigger power in the third millennium. And in the same way a custom spell can make a name for a magician, a unique vehicle can set a rigger apart from all other joystick jockeys.

This section provides rules for designing and modifying vehicles in **Shadowrun**. The first two subsections, **Vehicle Design** and **Vehicle Design Options**, cover the design of new vehicles. The third subsection, **Vehicle Customization**, covers the modification, upgrade and customization of existing production models.

The vehicle design and customization rules provided in this chapter supersede all previously published vehicle-construction rules. All vehicles that have appeared in previous **Shadowrun** publications have been re-constructed according to the new vehicle design system and their ratings recalculated accordingly. These revised ratings appear in the **Vehicle List** (p. 148). See **Converting Existing Vehicles** (p. 147) for guidelines on converting vehicle statistics from the old system to the current one.

**VEHICLE DESIGN**
Like a well-designed character, a well-designed vehicle demands some thought and creativity on the part of the player designing the machine. The point of vehicle design is not simply to cram the most armor, fastest engine and heaviest weapons into the cheapest vehicle frame. The point is to create a vehicle with special features and capabilities that best serve and enhance the character's own unique needs and personality.

The design process begins with the selection of a vehicle chassis and power plant, which together form the base for the vehicle's **Design Point Value**. The **Design Point Value** is the total sum of all the **Design Points** added to the vehicle. As additional improvements, enhancements, modifications and accessories are selected, more **Design Points** are added to the vehicle's **Design Point Value**. At the end of the process, the gamemaster multiplies the **Design Point Value** by the **Mark-Up Factor** to determine the final price of the vehicle.

The design process can be divided into the following steps:
1.  Select a Chassis
2.  Select a Power Plant
3.  Add Design Options
4.  Add Vehicle Modifications
5.  Determine Final Vehicle Cost

**STEP 1: SELECT A CHASSIS**
The **chassis** is a template that determines what type of vehicle is being constructed (bike, car, airplane and so on), as well as the vehicle's specific subtype (subcompact or sedan, ultralight or airliner and so on).

Besides the vehicle type, the chassis selected determines the starting values for certain **Vehicle Ratings**, namely **Handling, Body, Armor, Autonav** or **Pilot, Sensor** and **Cargo Factor (CF)**. The chassis also determines the starting seating arrangement, the arrangement of entry points, the set-up and breakdown time for drones, the landing and takeoff profiles for aircraft, and any other accessories and options that are already available for the chassis. The **Chassis Table** (p. 169) lists the different types of chassis available and the starting **Vehicle Ratings** for each.

The **Body Rating** of a chassis is fixed; it cannot be improved or reduced. Other **Vehicle Ratings** may be improved by adding design options and vehicle modifications that enhance those ratings. Doing so increases the **Design Point Value** of the vehicle and subsequently increases the final price.

Ratings may also be decreased if the player or gamemaster desires. For example, a player may wish to decrease the **Armor** or **CF Rating** of his rigger's custom vehicle below the starting value in order to create the fastest possible racing car. A player may also remove standard chassis components such as doors or seats. However, such "downgrades" do not decrease the **Design Point Value** or final price of the vehicle.

Chassis fall into one of eight categories, based on the **Vehicle Skill** needed to operate them: bikes, cars, fixed-wing aircraft, hovercraft, motorboats/sailboats, rotor craft, vectored-thrust craft and special vehicles.

**Bikes**
Bikes include two, three, and certain four-wheeled open-topped vehicles that a driver operates by sitting on top of the vehicle. Bikes cannot have **Autonav Ratings** greater than 2 unless they are modified for rigger adaptation. Bikes are divided into the following subtypes.

**Scooters**: Scooters are short-range city commuter vehicles. They do not offer spectacular performance, but they are fairly cheap.

**Racing Bikes**: Racing bikes are designed to achieve and sustain high speeds.

**Off-Road Bikes**: Off-road motorcycles are designed for traversing rough terrain and have better-than-standard off-road **Handling Ratings** (at the expense of on-road Handling).

**Choppers**: Choppers are heavy motorcycles designed for long-distance cruising.

**All-Terrain Vehicles**: All-terrain vehicles (**ATVs**) are three- or four-wheeled versions of the off-road bike. **ATVs** are easier to handle off-road, but they sacrifice on-road **Handling Rating** as well as speed.

**Cars**
Cars include all manner of ground vehicles, including wheeled and tracked vehicles. Cars are divided into the following subtypes.

**Commuters/Subcompacts**: Subcompacts are small, inexpensive cars designed primarily for commuting within a city. Most are one- or two-seaters and have very little cargo space.

**Sedans**: Sedans are medium-sized, four-seat cars. This subtype includes everything from family Ford Americars to luxury Toyota Elites.

**Sports Cars**: These two-seat cars are designed for moving at extremely high speeds.

**Limousines**: Limousines are extended-length luxury cars, such as the Mitsubishi Nightsky, designed for carrying extra passengers, amenities and accessories.

**Pickups**: Pickups include light trucks that weigh less than 1.25 tons (1,250 kilograms), such as sport-utility vans, 4WDs, jeeps and Hummers.

**Vans**: Vans are trucks that weigh between 1.25 and 2.5 tons.

**RVs**: All-terrain recreational vehicles (**RVs**) weigh in between 1.25 and 2.5 tons and are designed for long-range travel. **RVs** come equipped with living and sleeping amenities as a standard option.

**Sand Buggies**: Sand buggies are light, open-air four-wheeled vehicles designed for off-road use. Although similar to **ATVs** in structure and design, sand buggies can carry more passengers (up to four) and more cargo. Most sand buggies use open tube-frame chassis, but they often carry attachable canvas or plastic overhead and side panels for protection against the elements.

**Medium Transports**: Medium transports are freight-haulers that weigh between 2.5 and 5 tons.

**Heavy Transports**: Heavy transports are heavy-duty freight trucks that weigh in at 5 to 10 tons.

**Tractors**: Tractors usually weigh as much as heavy transports but they have no internal cargo capacity. Tractors are designed to pull one or more trailers and can haul as much as 18 tons of cargo.

**Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs)**: **APCs** are 15- to 30-ton armored ground vehicles designed for carrying troops into combat. (For an example of an **APC**, see the Devil Rat, p. 64 of **Fields of Fire**.) Though often mistaken for tanks, **APCs** are vulnerable to anti-vehicle missiles and can carry only the smallest of heavy weapons. **APCs** may use either tracks or wheels for propulsion.

**Crawlers**: Crawlers are unmanned drones designed for exclusive control by a remote control deck. Crawlers may move via tracks or wheels; few differences exist between the two types. All crawlers (and all drone chassis) come with a remote control interface and rigger adaptation as standard options.

Crawler chassis come in three sizes: micro, small and large. Micro-sized crawlers range in size anywhere from six to nine inches long and are light enough to be carried in the palm of a person's hand. Small crawlers may be as small as a toaster or as large as a large dog. Large crawlers are roughly comparable in size to a motorcycle or a human lying prone on the ground.

**Remote Patrol Vehicles (RPVs)**: **RPVs** are armored ground drones, designed to patrol and defend an area against unwanted intruders. **RPVs** may be tracked or wheeled. Most are roughly the size of a large dog, though some are as large as an average human.

**Fixed-Wing Aircraft**
Fixed-wing aircraft are airborne vehicles that use aerodynamic lift (as opposed to directed air pressure or vectored thrust) to stay aloft. This category does not include helicopters, tilt-wing or jump-jet aircraft. Piloting a fixed-wing aircraft requires the **Winged Planes Skill**. Fixed-wing aircraft are divided into the following subtypes.

**Ultralights**: An ultralight is a very small, single-pilot aircraft. Although the term originally referred to open-air hang gliders powered by an internal-combustion engine, any single-passenger aircraft, regardless of structure, is considered an ultralight for design purposes.

**Single-Engine Aircraft**: A single-engine aircraft possesses only one propulsion engine (either propeller or turbine).

**Twin-Engine Aircraft**: A twin-engine aircraft is a middleweight airplane with two propulsion engines, either propeller or turbine. Examples include regional or commuter aircraft that fly between small airports and larger ones serving major airline companies.

**Airliner**: An airliner is a heavy-duty aircraft, such as those operated by major air carriers. Airliners are capable of transcontinental or even intercontinental flight and rely on two, three, four or occasionally five heavy propeller or turbofan engines. Airliners fall short of high-speed civil transports (**HSCTs**) in terms of speed, range and capacity. However, standard riggers lack the skills and resources to design, modify or buy **HSCTs** and their larger cousins, suborbitals and semiballistics.

**Jet Fighters**: Jet fighters are supersonic combat aircraft controlled by one or two pilots. Jet fighters have a lifting capability of several tons, most of which is used for carrying heavy bombs and long-range missiles. Jet fighters never carry more than the lightest armor, to preserve their maneuverability and ordnance-carrying capacity.

**Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)**: **UAVs** are drone aircraft. Fixed-wing **UAVs** come in three sizes: small, medium and large. Small fixed-wing **UAVs** are approximately the size of toy model aircraft. Medium-sized **UAVs** have fuselages comparable in size to a dwarf or a small human. Large **UAVs** have fuselages as big as trolls, and some of the larger ones can actually carry metahumans.

**Hovercraft**
Also referred to as air-cushion vehicles or **ACVs**, hovercraft float centimeters above the ground or water on a cushion of pressurized air. Maneuverable on both land and sea, they make excellent amphibious vehicles. However, **ACVs** are not seaworthy without modification and will sink if powered down over water. **ACVs** are divided into the following subtypes.

**Small Hovercraft**: Small hovercraft are roughly comparable in size to pickups or sport utility vans and are used primarily as recreation or pleasure craft.

**Medium Hovercraft**: Medium hovercraft are approximately as large as vans or lightweight medium transports. Medium hovercraft are used as amphibious recreation vehicles, light cargo and passenger carriers, and even security vehicles.

**Heavy Hovercraft**: Heavy hovercraft are comparable in size to medium or heavy transports and can haul large numbers of passengers or large freight loads. The Confederated States Marine Corps uses armored heavy hovercraft as rapid-assault and screening vehicles during amphibious combat operations.

**Skimmers**: Skimmers are drone hovercraft. They come in two sizes, small and large, which are comparable in size to small and large crawlers.

**Motorboats/Sailboats**
Though motorboats and sailboats require different skills to handle, both use similar hull designs and are thus grouped together for design purposes. The **Motorboat/Sailboat** category covers only those boats with an overall length of less than 120 feet (40 meters). Standard rigger characters lack the skills and resources to design, modify or buy larger boats and ships. Motorboats and sailboats are divided into the following subtypes.

**Skiffs**: A skiff is a small boat under 20 feet (6 meters) long.

**Water Scooters**: Water scooters, sometimes called jet skis, are waterborne versions of motorcycles. They are exclusively motor-powered for design purposes.

**Speedboats**: Speedboats are high-speed boats, such as a cigarette racing boat. Some not-so-powerful versions also exist for daytripping. Speedboats generally measure between 24 and 40 feet long.

**Sport Cruisers**: Sport cruisers are medium-sized boats, generally used as pleasure boats by the wealthy. Sport cruisers generally measure between 20 and 60 feet (4 and 20 meters) long.

**Yachts**: Yachts are large boats with an overall length greater than 60 feet (20 meters), but less than 120 feet (40 meters). Most of them are the toys of the well-to-do. All yachts come with basic living amenities.

**Mini-subs**: Mini-subs are submersible boats capable of traveling underwater. They are 15 meters or less in length and can dive to a maximum depth of 450 feet (150 meters). Larger and deeper-diving submarines are beyond the scope of this sourcebook and are not covered in these rules.

**Rotor Craft**
Rotor craft generate vertical lift by propelling air downwards, creating a localized updraft that lifts the aircraft. This category includes helicopters and tilt-wing aircraft. Rotor craft are divided into the following subtypes.

**Autogyros**: Autogyros are single-passenger ultra-light helicopters, such as the Ares Wasp or Yellowjacket. Though they have significant Body and Armor Ratings and engine performance, they are very versatile.

**Utility Helicopters**: Utility helicopters are medium-sized multipurpose helicopters, such as the Hughes WK-2 Stallion.

**Cargo Helicopters**: Cargo helicopters are large helicopters designed for carrying heavy loads. The Ares Dragon is one example of a cargo helicopter.

**Tilt-Wing Airplanes**: Tilt-wing airplanes are fixed-wing aircraft that can alter the incidence of their wings and perform vertical take-offs and landings. These craft have traveling ranges comparable to fixed-wing aircraft, yet they can hover and make vertical landings like helicopters. Almost all tilt-wing airplanes are propeller-driven.

**Attack Helicopters**: Attack helicopters are one- or two-passenger high-performance combat helicopters. Most militaries use attack helicopters as missile carriers for close-air support or longer-range deep-strike missions. Consequently, they tend to be lightly armored. Because they are so specialized, attack helicopters are rarely used for any other role.

**Rotary Wing UAVs**: Rotary wing **UAVs** are drone helicopters. They come in three sizes: small, medium and large. Small rotary **UAVs** measure between 8 to 14 inches long (many can even be held in the palm of one's hand). Medium and large versions are equal in size to fixed-wing **UAVs**.

**Tilt-Wing UAVs**: Tilt-wing **UAVs** are drone tilt-wing aircraft. They come in two sizes, medium and large, which correspond in size to medium and large fixed-wing **UAVs**.

**Vectored-Thrust Craft**
Vectored-thrust craft use directed jets of turbojet and turbofan exhaust to generate force and overcome the pull of gravity. Vehicles that fall into this category include low-altitude vehicles (known commonly as "thunderbirds") and jump-jet fighters (such as the current AV-8 Harrier). Vectored-thrust craft are divided into the following subtypes.

**Thunderbirds**: Also known as low-altitude vehicles (**LAVs**) or "t-birds," thunderbirds have no wings and rely entirely on jet propulsion to provide lift and thrust. Without adequate power, t-birds become flying (or more precisely, falling) bricks. Consequently, thunderbirds generally have short ranges and tremendous fuel requirements. In most militaries, thunderbirds are used for short-range close air support, as well as armor support in terrain not suited to tank maneuvers. In these applications, t-birds are heavily armored and fitted with machine guns and assault cannons in place of rockets and missiles.

**Jump-Jet Fighters**: Jump-jet fighters are similar to standard fixed-wing jet fighters but have additional vertical vents for vertical landings and takeoffs and hovering. (To date, the Federated Boeing Eagle is the only published **Shadowrun** vehicle that fits this description.)

**Vectored-Thrust UAVs**: Vectored-thrust **UAVs** are drone t-birds. They come in three sizes: small, medium and large. These sizes correspond to the sizes of fixed-wing **UAVs**.

**Special Vehicles**
Special vehicles are vehicles that do not fit into existing vehicle categories. Controlling special vehicles normally requires a **Special Skill**, but in most cases a character can default to a relevant **Vehicle Skill** with a +2 target modifier (+1 if the character is a rigger and the vehicle is rigged). Special vehicles are divided into the following subtypes.

**Zeppelins**: More commonly known as "blimps," zeppelins are rigid-structure, lighter-than-air (**LTA**) dirigibles that use helium to provide lift. Zeppelins are huge but fairly easy to bring down. Jet propeller engines propel most zeppelins, though some have been outfitted with turbojets.

**Mini-Blimps**: Mini-blimps are miniature zeppelins. Their capability for hovering indefinitely makes them especially well-suited for reconnaissance and wide-area surveillance.

**Walkers**: Walkers are drones that use robotic legs for propulsion. (Legs can provide a distinct advantage over wheels or tracks when crossing difficult terrain.) Walkers come in three sizes—micro, small and large—which correspond to crawler sizes.

**Anthroforms**: Anthroforms are specialized walker drones with metahuman-shaped bodies. They can perform nearly any physical task a metahuman can, and can do it with greater strength, speed and agility than even a cybered metahuman. However, anthroforms lack the intelligence, breadth of experience and creative adaptation that metahumanity possesses, which is why anthroforms have not replaced metahuman workers except in high-risk hazard areas, such as nuclear power plants and ultra-heavy industrial work areas.

Inspired by some of the adventures of Allied forces in **Operation Desert Storm**, Steffi wants to re-create the tactical beach buggy used by some of the U.S. light infantry and special forces in that campaign. Steffi decides to call this armed dune buggy the **Lockheed-Chenowth Light Strike Vehicle**, a product created in joint partnership between the defense giant Lockheed and the British corporation Chenowth.

Scanning through the **Chassis Table** (p. 169), Steffi finds the perfect chassis: the **Sand Buggy**. The Sand Buggy has the following stats: **Handling** 4/4, **Body** 3, **Armor** 0, **Cargo** 4 (with a maximum of 15), **Autonav** 0, and **Sensor** 0. It starts with four bucket seats, two in the front and two in the back, and is an open-entry vehicle. This chassis is worth 20 **Design Points**, so the **Design Point Value** for Steffi's new vehicle starts out at 20.

Rich, on the other hand, is a racing fan and wants his rigger, named the Bratly Kid, to own a Formula One race car. The Bratly Kid is determined to own the most amazing car in the sprawl. (Hey, it takes all kinds.) The BK also recently grabbed the brass ring—he got an honest-to-Dunkelzahn big payday! Nuyen is not an object, and so Rich can modify his rigger's vehicle to his heart's content.

Looking through the chassis list, the closest thing Rich can find to a Formula One car is the **Sports Car** chassis. The Sports Car comes with two bucket seats and two doors. Because Formula One racing cars have only one seat and no doors, Rich decides to remove the doors and the extra seat. However, he still has to pay the full number of **Design Points** for the chassis.

Rich looks up **Sports Car** in the **Chassis Table** and finds that the vehicle has the following stats: **Handling** 4/8, **Body** 3, **Armor** 0, **Cargo** 3 (with a Maximum of 18), **Autonav** 0 and **Sensor** 0. In addition to its two bucket seats and two doors, it also allows top entry. Rich only wants the top entry. The **Design Point Value** for a sports car is 110, and so Rich begins vehicle construction at that amount.

**2. SELECT POWER PLANT**
A vehicle's power plant provides power to move the vehicle and operate its accessories and modifications. The type of power plant selected determines the starting and maximum values of the vehicle's **Speed, Acceleration, Load** and **Economy Ratings**, as well as the vehicle's initial **Signature Rating** and fuel tank size.

The **Power Plant Table** (p. 167) lists the different power plants available, the chassis that may use each type of power plant, and the starting and maximum values conferred by each power plant. If a chassis type is not listed under a particular power plant, the vehicle may not use that power plant.

All templates begin with the vehicle's Speed and Load at the base minimum rating. Either rating may be increased with the addition of extra **Design Points** to the vehicle's **Design Point Value** (see **Add Design Options**). Players and gamemasters may also reduce ratings below their starting values if desired, but doing so will not decrease the **Design Point Value** of the vehicle.

**Electric Motor**
Direct-current, battery-powered electrical motors have high **Signature Ratings** because they generate little heat compared to other types of engines. However, their low power outputs produce low **Speed** and **Load Ratings**. The fuel consumption of electric motors is expressed as a **Power Factor (PF)**.

**Methane Engine**
A methane engine is a combustion engine that uses methane gas instead of gasoline as its fuel. Methane burns cleaner than gasoline, which makes it a highly touted alternative in the NAN and other environmentally friendly countries. Methane engines provide lower overall performance and lower **Signature Ratings** than gasoline engines, but they also have far greater fuel capacities. The fuel consumption of methane engines is expressed in bars of air pressure. (For you technoheads out there, one bar is slightly less than the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level—14.5 psi or 105 newtons per square meter.)

**Gasoline Engine**
Even with the development of alternate fuel sources, petroleum-derived gasoline remains the primary fuel for most ground and water vehicles and some aircraft. Some countries (such as the NAN) and several metroplexes, however, may impose legal limits on the use of such vehicles within their respective jurisdictions for environmental reasons. The fuel consumption of gasoline engines is expressed in liters.

**Diesel Engine**
Diesel is another petroleum-based fuel used by many vehicles. Diesel has a lower flashpoint than gasoline, which tends to limit the **Speed Ratings** of diesel-powered vehicles, but diesel engines provide higher heat-conversion efficiency—which results in a higher **Load** capability—than gasoline engines. The fuel consumption of diesel engines is expressed in liters.

**Jet Propeller Engine**
Jet propeller aircraft use propellers to blow air over their wings, creating aerodynamic lift with forward thrust on the side. Propeller aircraft are slower than jets (props can't break the sound barrier, for instance), but they generally have higher Signatures, better fuel economy and lower price tags than jet turbine engines. Propeller engines consume jet fuel, which is measured in liters. Tilt-wing aircraft are the only aircraft other than the **Fixed-Wing Aircraft** category that use jet propeller engines.

**Jet Turbine Engine**
Jet turbine engines include turbojets, turbofans, ramjets—just about anything short of a space rocket engine. Though more powerful than jet propeller engines, jet turbine engines have lower Signatures, consume more fuel and are expensive to build and maintain.

All rotor craft and vectored-thrust aircraft—except for tilt-wing designs—use jet turbine engines.

**Sails**
Sails harness the power of the wind and may be used with certain types of watercraft. Sailing is a tricky skill to master, however, so sailcraft generally underperform in comparison to their powered counterparts. However, sail-powered vessels have the highest **Signature Ratings**, as well as unlimited "fuel mileage"—as long as the wind is blowing, of course.

Steffi, deciding to keep things simple, determines that the **Light Strike Vehicle** will have a gasoline engine. Looking through the **Power Plant Table** (p. 167), Steffi finds the following entry for the **Sand Buggy** chassis under the Gasoline heading: **Speed** 90 (maximum 100), **Acceleration** 6, (maximum 10), **Load** 40 kg (maximum 160 kg), **Signature** 2, **Economy** 8 km/liter (maximum 12 km/liter) and **Fuel** 40 liters.

A gasoline engine for a sand buggy is worth 25 **Design Points**, which increases the **Design Point Value** for the new vehicle to 45 points.

Rich's choice is easy. Sports cars only come with gasoline engines. Under the **Sports Car** entry, Rich finds **Speed** 160 (maximum 270), **Acceleration** 10 (maximum 18), **Load** 40 (Maximum 200), **Signature** 2, **Economy** 6 km/liter (maximum 10 km/liter) and **Fuel** 60 liters. The **Design Point Value** for a sports-car gasoline engine is 65, pushing Rich's **Design Point** cost to 175.

**3. ADD DESIGN OPTIONS**
Design options are improvements, enhancements and accessories added to the vehicle by the manufacturer during the engineering and manufacturing processes. Design options are not available to shadow mechanics on the street.

As a general rule, any feature or improvement that involves internal restructuring of the vehicle is considered a design option. Additionally, the gamemaster may re-designate any vehicle modification (see **Add Vehicle Modifications**, below) as a design option if he wants to limit or restrict his players' access to a modification.

Some design options consume cargo space or add weight to the vehicle. These factors are listed under **CF Consumed** and **Load Reduction** for each entry in **Design Options** and also under **Design Specifications** for each entry in **Vehicle Customization** (p. 118). If a vehicle incorporates an option that takes up CF or Load, reduce the appropriate rating by the amount of CF or Load consumed. No vehicle can carry more design options than its **CF** or **Load Rating** allows.

Steffi decides that her new **Light Strike Vehicle** should have a better off-road **Handling Rating**, so she decides to make a straight **Handling** improvement to the vehicle's off-road **Handling Rating**, reducing it from 4 to 3.

A straight **Handling Improvement** (p. 116) costs 25 points for every point subtracted from the vehicle's on-road or off-road **Handling Rating**. Therefore, the **Handling** reduction increases the **Light Strike Vehicle's Design Point Value** by 25 points, from 45 to 70.

Steffi also decides to increase the vehicle's **Acceleration Rating** from 6 to 8. Improving the Acceleration costs 25 **Design Points** per point of increase, so this 2-point increase adds 50 more **Design Points** to the strike vehicle's **Design Point Value**, raising it to 120 points.

Anticipating some of the modifications she's planning to incorporate into the vehicle, Steffi decides to increase the vehicle's **Cargo** and **Load Ratings**. She decides to add 2 **CF** to the **Cargo Rating** and 30 kg to the **Load Rating** for final ratings of **Cargo** 6 and **Load** 70. The associated **Design Point** costs for each option are 10 **Design Points** for the Cargo increase and 3 points for the Load increase. This increases the **Design Point Value** of the **Light Strike Vehicle** by 13 points, from 120 to 133.

Meanwhile, all Rich thinks about is speed, speed and more speed. First, Rich is going to break the bank and get himself a vehicle made with **smart materials**. This costs him 100 **Design Points**, but allows him to increase the vehicle's maximum **Speed** and **Acceleration** ratings by 15 percent (it also allows for an increase in Load, but Rich doesn't care about that).

The smart materials increase the racing car's maximum speed to 311 and bump up the maximum Acceleration to 21. For the record, the maximum **Load Rating** rises to 230. The **Design Point Value** has gone up to 275 points. The gamemaster also notes that the **Mark-Up Factor** multiplier has just increased by .5 and the car's **Availability** is 4.

Rich decides it's time to increase the Acceleration and the Speed. Both upgrades cost 2 **Design Points** per point of increase. Rich is going to max them both out, so he increases Acceleration by 11 points (from the standard **Sports Car** maximum of 10 to the new maximum of 21). This costs him a total of 22 **Design Points** (11 x 2). The **Speed Rating** increase goes from the standard maximum Speed of 160 to the new maximum Speed of 311, a total increase of 151 points. This upgrade costs Rich 302 **Design Points** (151 x 2). The total **Design Points** for both rating increases is 324, which brings Rich's revised **Design Point Value** up to 599.

Next, Rich decides to increase his **Load Rating** because some of the toys Rich wants will require more power from the engine. Each 10-kg increase in Load costs 1 **Design Point**. Rich decides to add more than he thinks he will need, because you never know what you may want to customize later. So Rich adds 100 kg to his car's **Load Rating** for a total of 140 kg (well below the maximum of 230). That increase costs him 10 **Design Points**, raising his vehicle's **Design Point Value** to 609.

Finally, Rich realizes that speed without good handling means he'll be driving a death trap. Rich wants to improve his on-road **Handling** (if he has to take this thing off-road, he's already lost the race). He improves the **Handling** to its maximum by reducing the standard **Sports Car Handling Rating** from 4 to 2. That improvement costs 25 points per point of reduction, for a total of 50 **Design Points**. Adding this to the **Design Point Value**, Rich gets a new total of 659.

**4. ADD VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS**
Unlike design options, **vehicle modifications** (mods for short) are enhancements and accessories that can be installed in a new vehicle by the manufacturer or added to an existing vehicle by a rigger or shadow mechanic as **vehicle customizations** (see **Vehicle Customization**, p. 118). Generally, vehicle mods installed during the design process have fewer restrictions than those added during vehicle customization, but they also cost more.

When installing a vehicle mod during vehicle design, remember to use its **Design Point** cost only when calculating the final cost of the vehicle. Do not use the modification's nuyen cost.

Some modifications consume cargo space or add weight to the vehicle. These factors are listed under **CF Consumed** and **Load Reduction** for each entry in **Design Options** and also under **Design Specifications** for each entry in **Vehicle Customization**. If a vehicle incorporates an option that takes up **CF** or **Load**, reduce the appropriate rating by the amount of **CF** or **Load** consumed. No vehicle can carry more modifications than its **CF** or **Load Rating** allows.

Now it's time to add all the neat toys and flashy features to the **Light Strike Vehicle**. First, Steffi decides that the buggy needs to have **reinforced roll bars** (p. 129), because soldiers tend to be rough on their equipment. Second, it will need a radio to keep in touch with headquarters, and installing a radio requires that the vehicle have an **electronics port** (p. 139). Last, the vehicle needs **weapon mounts** (it is a strike vehicle, after all). Steffi decides that a **ring mount** (p. 134) and a passenger-side **pintle mount** (p. 134) will do nicely.

Thumbing through **Vehicle Customization** (beginning on p. 118), Steffi looks up the modifications she wants and jots down the associated costs. **Roll Bars**: 0 **Design Points**, 0 **CF**, 0 kg Load. **Electronics Port**: 10 **Design Points** plus the radio's cost (we'll ignore the radio for now), 0.5 **CF**, 0 kg Load (actually the weight of the radio, but we'll also ignore that for now). **Ring mount**: 10 **Design Points**, 1 **CF**, 25 kg Load. **Pintle mount**: 1 **Design Point**, 0 **CF**, 0 kg Load. Total costs for all modifications: 21 **Design Points**, 1.5 **CF** (rounded up to 2) and 25 kg Load.

The **CF** and **Load** costs are subtracted from the vehicle's **Cargo** and **Load Ratings** respectively, so the **Light Strike Vehicle** now has a **Cargo Rating** of 4 and a **Load Rating** of 45 kg. The 21 **Design Points** are added to the vehicle's **Design Point Value**, bringing the total up to 154 points.

Now let's see what Rich comes up with for modifications to his race car. He decides not to take the engine customization—it carries far too great a risk of engine failure for the benefits it provides and the amount it will cost him (and he's putting more than enough nuyen into this vehicle already). He does, however, choose **nitrous oxide injectors** for that quick burst of getaway speed. He also includes a **datajack, rigger adaptation, basic sensors**, a **crash cage** and some **high-performance tires**. Cost is not a problem for Rich; however, he may have trouble with load and space. **Design Points**, **Cargo Factor** and **Load** costs are as follows for the mods he's selected:

**Rating 6 Nitrous Oxide Injectors**: 330 **Design Points** (55 **Design Points** per rating point; 55 x 6 = 330), 1.5 **CF** and 15 kg Load.
**Datajack Port**: 25 **Design Points**, 10 kg Load.
**Rigger Adapation**: 35 **Design Points**.
**Sensors**, Level 2: 150 **Design Points**, 1 **CF**, 25 kg Load.
**Crash Cage**: 40 **Design Points**, 10 kg Load.

Rich adds up all his customizations. Total **Design Points** = 580, Total **CF** = 2.5 (his vehicle's maximum is 3), and Total **Load** = 90 (leaving 50 kg for future customization).

Rich's final **Design Point Value** for his Formula One car is 1,239. After finding that total, Rich calculates the cost of the high-performance tires. This cost, expressed in nuyen rather than **Design Points**, is 75¥ x Body (3) each, for a total of 900 nuyen. He's going to be paying a bundle for this vehicle.

The **Wandjina**, produced by Commonwealth Aerospace Systems of Australia, is a fixed-wing **UAV** designed to provide close air support to ground troops. For purposes of vehicle design, it uses the **Fixed-Wing UAV** chassis (in the **Fixed Wing Aircraft** category) and is a military-grade drone.

The base **Mark-Up Factor** for the **Wandjina** is 2.5. Because it is military grade, a **Special Design modifier** of 3 applies; multiplying the base **Mark-Up Factor** by 3 gives a total result of 7.5. Because the **Wandjina** is also a drone, this result is then multiplied by a second applicable **Special Design modifier**—0.1—for a final result of 0.75.

Some **Mark-Up Factors**, modifiers and multipliers are expressed as ranges of numbers (such as 1 to 2.5). In these cases, the gamemaster may either roll dice to determine the exact value or simply select a value within the range.

Gamemasters have the final say on the **Mark-Up Factors** of all vehicles and may increase or decrease **Mark-Up Factors** as they see fit. Also, gamemasters may round off the final nuyen cost of a vehicle to the nearest 500 or thousand to keep the math simple.


---

### 5. DETERMINE FINAL VEHICLE COST

After the gamemaster and/or player have finished designing the vehicle, the gamemaster multiplies the **Design Point Value** by the appropriate **Mark-Up Factor** to determine the final cost for the vehicle. He then multiplies that result by 100 to translate the cost from points into nuyen.

**Mark-Up Factors** are listed in the **Mark-Up Factors Table**. The **Chassis Category** lists the base **Mark-Up Factor** for various vehicle chassis. The **Special Features/Unusual Equipment** lists additional **Mark-Up Modifiers** conferred by unusual features (such as smart materials), unique designs or equipment for special purposes. Add these **Mark-Up Modifiers** to the base **Mark-Up Factor**.

The **Special Designs** section lists multipliers based on certain special design purposes. If any of these apply, multiply the total **Mark-Up Factor** by the appropriate multiplier. In some cases (such as a security-grade drone), two or more of these special-design multipliers may apply. If this is the case, multiply the **Mark-Up Factor** by the first multiplier and then multiply that result by the second multiplier. Do not add the two multipliers together!

### MARK-UP FACTORS TABLE

| Chassis Category | Mark-Up Factor |

**VEHICLE DESIGN AND CUSTOMIZATION** (continued)
on Steffi's vehicle are weapon mounts, which classify the vehicle as either security-grade or military-grade. Because the vehicle is unarmored and sports relatively light weapons, Diane decides to call it a security grade vehicle and to apply the lowest possible security-grade multiplier, which is 2. 1 x 2 = 2, so the final **Mark-Up Factor** is 2.

Now Diane multiplies the strike vehicle's **Design Point Value** (154) by the Mark-Up Factor. She gets a total of 308 (154 x 2 = 308). To find this cost in nuyen, she multiplies 308 by 100, for a total of 30,800 nuyen. Though Diane could leave this number as is, she decides to round it down to 30,500 nuyen.

The final stats for the Light Strike Vehicle are:
* **Handling:** 4/3
* **Speed:** 90
* **Acceleration:** 8
* **B/A:** 3/0
* **Signature:** 2
* **Pilot:** 0
* **Sensor:** 0
* **Cost:** 30,500¥
* **Seating:** 2 bucket + 2 bucket
* **Entry Points:** Open
* **Cargo:** 4 CF
* **Load:** 45
* **Economy:** 8 km/liter
* **Fuel:** Gasoline (40 liters)
* **L/T Profile:** NA
* **Other Features:** Electronics Port, Pintle Mount, Ring Mount, Roll Bars

Now let's move on to Rich. Rich is pretty darn happy with his racing car, which he's named the Johnny Player Special. He thought about adding a fixed mount, but he didn't want the mark-up to go sky high ... plus, he can always add it as a customization later.

Rich's base **Mark-Up Factor** is also 1, because a **Sports Car** chassis definitely qualifies as a car. The smart materials add a .5 mark-up modifier, for a **Mark-Up Factor** of 1.5. Diane decides that none of the secondary multipliers apply to the Johnny Player Special—it's not a military or security vehicle, and the luxury classification really doesn't do it justice. Because a Formula One race car is still pretty unusual, however, she decides to modify the **Mark-Up Factor** by adding another 1.0, making the total modifier 2.5.

Next, Diane multiplies the car's **Design Point Value** (1,239) by the final **Mark-Up Factor** (2.5) for a total **Design Point Value** of 3,097.5. Multiplying this result by 100 to convert it into nuyen makes the final cost of the Johnny Player Special 309,750 nuyen. To simplify the math, Diane rounds this cost up to 310,000¥ and tosses in the high-performance tires for free (plus a keen car deodorizer). Diane and Rich then write down the final stats for the Johnny Player Special:
* **Handling:** 2/8
* **Speed:** 311
* **Acceleration:** 21
* **B/A:** 3/0
* **Signature:** 2
* **Pilot:** 0
* **Sensor:** 2
* **Cost:** 310,000¥
* **Seating:** 1 bucket
* **Entry Points:** open
* **Cargo:** .5 CF
* **Load:** 50
* **Economy:** 6 km/liter
* **Fuel:** Gasoline (60 liters)
* **Other Features:** Crash Cage, Datajack Port, Nitrous Oxide Injectors, Rigger Adaptation, Smart Materials

### VEHICLE DESIGN OPTIONS

The design options in this section can only be selected during vehicle design. They are not available for vehicle customization. The description of each option explains the option's game effects and uses the following categories.

* **Design Cost**: The option's design cost is expressed in **Design Points**. Some design options have a flat **Design Point** cost; otherwise, the cost of an option varies according to the selected level of improvement.
* **Maximum Rating or Improvement**: This category lists the maximum rating or amount of improvement a vehicle can take in the design option.
* **CF Consumed**: This number is the **Cargo Factor** that the design option takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep track of the total **Cargo Rating** of the vehicle during design to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed for the chassis chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough CF in its **Cargo Rating** to accommodate the design option, it cannot accept the option. Note that installing options decreases the available cargo space for storing goodies such as personal gear, luggage, loot and dragon eggs.
* **Load Reduction**: This listing is the number of kilograms from the vehicle's **Load Rating** that the design option takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep track of the total **Load Rating** of the vehicle during design, to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed for the power plant chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough kilograms in its **Load Rating** to accommodate the design option, it cannot accept the option. Note that installing options decreases the available **Load Rating** for hauling personal gear, luggage, assorted loot and the like.

**ACCELERATION INCREASE**
This option improves a vehicle's **Acceleration Rating**. Acceleration may only be increased up to the listed maximum **Acceleration Rating** for a given power plant on the **Power Plant Table**, p. 167.

* **Design Cost:** 2 points per +1 increase to Acceleration
* **Maximum Improvement:** Power plant's listed maximum Acceleration
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**ADD STOL/VSTOL TO AIRCRAFT'S TAKEOFF/LANDING PROFILE**
All fixed-wing aircraft chassis begin with a Standard takeoff and landing profile (see the **Runway Distances Table**, p. 36). However, players may add **STOL** or **VSTOL** capabilities to their fixed-wing aircraft. **STOL** costs 250 **Design Points**; **VSTOL** costs 400 **Design Points**. Changing an aircraft's takeoff/landing profile does not consume **CF** or reduce **Load**.

**INCREASE FUEL TANK CAPACITY**
The **Design Point** and **CF** costs of enlarging a vehicle's fuel tank vary according to the type of engine used in the vehicle. These costs are listed in the **Fuel Tank Capacity Table**. Increasing the size of the fuel tank does not reduce the vehicle's **Load Rating**.

**HANDLING IMPROVEMENT**
Vehicle **Handling Ratings** can be reduced at a cost of 25 **Design Points** per 1-point reduction. (Lowering a vehicle's **Handling Rating** improves the vehicle's handling.) A vehicle's **Handling Rating** cannot be reduced to less than half of the chassis' original **Handling Rating** (rounded up) listed on the **Chassis Table** (p. 169). For ground vehicles, Handling reductions must be applied to the vehicle's on-road or off-road **Handling Rating**, not both.

* **Design Cost:** 25 points per -1 to Handling Rating
* **Maximum Improvement:** 1/2 of template's original Handling (rounded up)
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**HYDROFOIL CAPABILITY**
Hydrofoil capability may be added to all motorboats (except for skiffs). When engaging hydrofoil capability, the boat elevates on three large "skis" that eliminate drag on the water, thus improving the craft's **Speed, Acceleration** and **Signature**.

When a boat's hydrofoil is engaged, the vehicle's **Speed** and **Acceleration Ratings** increase by 25 percent (to find the improved rating, multiply the original rating by 1.25, then round down to the nearest whole number). Additionally, the boat's **Signature** increases by 1. However, the boat's **Handling Rating** increases by 1 when the foils are down.

* **Design Cost:** 50 points
* **Maximum Improvement:** NA
* **CF Consumed:** 8
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**IMPROVED ECONOMY**
The **Economy** of a vehicle may be improved at a cost of 5 **Design Points** for each 5-percent improvement (multiply the initial **Economy Rating** by 1.05 to determine a 5-percent increase). The **Economy Rating** may not be increased beyond the maximum **Economy Rating** listed in the **Power Plant Table**.

* **Design Cost:** 5 points per 5-percent increase
* **Maximum Improvement:** Maximum Economy for chassis
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**INCREASED CARGO SPACE**
The cargo capacity of a vehicle may be increased at a cost of 5 **Design Points** for every 1-point **CF** increase. Cargo space may not be increased beyond the maximum **Cargo Rating** for the chassis listed on the **Chassis Table**.

To ensure that a vehicle does not exceed its allowed **Cargo Rating** during vehicle design, players and gamemasters are advised to keep a tally of the vehicle's total **Cargo Rating**. Add the **CF** consumption of all design options and vehicle modifications selected, and subtract the total **CF Consumed** from the vehicle's **Cargo Rating** to determine the final **Cargo Rating** for the vehicle.

* **Design Cost:** 5 points per +1 CF
* **Maximum Improvement:** Maximum CF listed for chassis
* **CF Consumed:** NA

**LIVING AMENITIES** (continued)
Living amenities require at least 200 **CF** of cargo space. Characters may use 160 **CF** of this cargo space for stowing gear or for extra passengers, but not for installing any additional vehicle modifications.

* **Design Cost:**
    * Basic: 40 points per passenger (including driver)
    * Improved: 50 points, plus 40 points per passenger
    * High: 100 points, plus 40 points per passenger
* **Maximum Rating:** NA
* **CF Consumed:** 200
* **Load Reduction:** 100 kg

**LOAD INCREASE**
A vehicle's **Load** may be increased at a cost of 1 **Design Point** for each additional 10 kilograms of Load. A vehicle's **Load** may not be increased beyond the maximum **Load Rating** listed for the vehicle's power plant on the **Power Plant Table** (p. 167).

To ensure that a vehicle does not exceed its maximum **Load Rating** during vehicle design, players and gamemasters are advised to keep a tally of the vehicle's total **Load Rating**. Add the **Load Reductions** of all design options and vehicle modifications selected, and subtract the total **Load Reduction** from the vehicle's **Load Rating** to determine the final **Load Rating** for the vehicle.

* **Design Cost:** 1 point per +10 kilograms to Load
* **Maximum Improvement:** Power plant's listed maximum Load
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** NA

**MEDICAL-TREATMENT GEAR**
Medical-treatment gear consists of advanced diagnostic electronics, pressurized oxygen tanks and breathing masks, an array of drugs more sophisticated than a standard medkit and all other related gear found in a paramedic ambulance.

A character with access to medical-treatment gear receives one additional die to her **Biotech Skill** when providing first aid (p. 115, SRII). Additionally, patients treated for Deadly damage with medical treatment gear during the first hour after injury gain an additional die on their **Body Test** for avoiding permanent damage (p. 113, SRII).

Medical gear with one-patient capacity also increases the vehicle's passenger seating capacity by 2.5 passengers. Gear with two-passenger capacity increases the vehicle's passenger seating capacity by 5 passengers, and so on. Normally, a paramedic occupies the extra passenger seat, but any character may occupy it.

* **Design Cost:** 400 points, plus 80 points per patient
* **Maximum Rating:** NA
* **CF Consumed:** 225
* **Load Reduction:** 500 kilograms

**IMPROVE ROBOT'S LEARNING POOL**
A robot's **Learning Pool** represents its ability to learn from its environment and adapt its methods to pursue its prime directive. (See **Robots**, p. 67, for more information.)

The gamemaster should set a robot's maximum **Learning Pool** and the design cost for increasing the pool based on the type of robot.

* **Design Cost:** GM's discretion
* **Maximum Rating:** GM's discretion
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kilograms

**SIGNATURE IMPROVEMENT**
A vehicle's **Signature** may be improved by using alternative nonmetallic materials in the vehicle's chassis or hull or by redesigning the vehicle's structural profile to reduce its radar cross-section and exhaust emissions.

The gamemaster may set limits for **Signature** improvement, but as a general rule, 1 level of increase should be the maximum allowed for vehicles available to the general public. Security vehicles should be limited to no more than 2 levels of increase, and increases of 3 or more points should exist almost solely in the domain of military contractors.

* **Design Cost:** (Levels of improvement) x 200 points
* **Maximum Improvement:** Gamemaster's discretion
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**SMART MATERIALS**
**Smart materials** are a revolutionary new state-of-the-art enhancement available only as a manufacturer's design option. **Smart materials** consist of layered piezoelectric compounds that bend and warp when a certain electrical voltage is applied (more cool techno jargon to toss around and impress your gaming mates).

If a vehicle is equipped with **smart materials**, reduce its Handling by 1 and add a +1 modifier whenever the vehicle makes a **Stress Test** (see **Stress**, p. 25).

Also, **smart materials** reduce a vehicle's weight and increase the vehicle's maximum **Speed, Acceleration** and **Load Ratings** by 15 percent. (Simply multiply the initial maximum from the **Power Plant Table**, p. 167, by 1.15 and round up to determine the new maximum.)

Note that **smart materials** do not automatically increase a vehicle's **Speed, Acceleration** and **Load Ratings**—instead, they raise the limits on those ratings. A player must pay for the **Speed Increase, Acceleration Increase** and **Load Increase** design options to actually increase the ratings.

Helicopters equipped with **smart materials** also increase their **Signature** by 1, because a smart-material drive shaft eliminates the rotor's mechanical actuators that cause the audible "eggbeater" noise and increase the radar cross section.

**Smart materials** cost 100 **Design Points**, raise the vehicle's **Mark-Up Factor** by 50 and increase by 4 the **Availability** of the vehicle.

* **Design Cost:** 100 points
* **Maximum Rating:** NA
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**SPEED INCREASE**
A vehicle's **Speed Rating** may be increased at the cost of 2 **Design Points** per 1-point rating increase. Note that a vehicle's **Speed Rating** may not be increased beyond the maximum **Speed Rating** listed on the **Power Plant Table** (p. 167).

The **Stall Speeds** of fixed-wing aircraft cannot be changed.

* **Design Cost:** 2 points per +1 increase to Speed
* **Maximum Improvement:** Power plant's listed maximum Speed
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**STRUCTURAL AGILITY**
This option is available only for vehicles that incorporate the drive-by-wire modification (see **Drive-by-Wire Systems**, p. 124). The computer controls of a drive-by-wire system allow designers to push the development envelope by creating vehicles so dynamically unstable that an unassisted (meta)human driver/pilot cannot control them. However, the digital-control software can make minute adjustments many times per microsecond, thus rendering the vehicle stable through the sheer quickness of the microtronics.

Each level of **Structural Agility** provides a +1 bonus to the character's **Reaction Attribute** when driving the vehicle. This Reaction bonus also applies to a rigger's **Control Pool**, so it effectively raises the **Control Pool** by 1 when the character is rigging the vehicle.

The maximum **Structural Agility** level equals the vehicle's **Drive-by-Wire** level.

A vehicle must be fitted with a drive-by-wire system during vehicle design to accommodate **Structural Agility**. This option cannot be added if the vehicle is fitted with a drive-by-wire system during vehicle customization. Additionally, increases to a vehicle's drive-by-wire system during vehicle customization do not increase the levels of **Structural Agility** it may accept.

* **Design Cost:** 150 points per level (plus the **Drive-by-Wire** modification)
* **Maximum Rating:** Number of levels purchased in the **Drive-by-Wire** modification
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

### VEHICLE CUSTOMIZATION

Vehicle customization may be performed after a vehicle has been designed and manufactured. Unlike design, customization requires a skilled mechanic and any required parts. That's right—no need for millions of nuyen or a team of overpaid engineers—just the right parts, the ingenious know-how of your friendly neighborhood shadow mechanic and a little bit of time is all it takes. During vehicle customization, the following types of modifications may be performed: engine, control systems and protective-systems modifications, **Signature** enhancers, weapon-mount modifications, electronic-systems modifications, and miscellaneous modifications/accessories.

To customize a vehicle, the character first has to procure the parts. The character can do this however he likes—through a fixer, contacts, favors and so on. Use the rules for obtaining equipment, including **Availability** and **Street Index**, published in **SRII** and the **Shadowrun Companion** to resolve parts searches.

After obtaining the required parts, the character (or his mechanic) must install the modification by making an **Installation Test** with an appropriate **Build/Repair Skill** (or skills). The required skill, **Installation Test** target number and required base time for each modification are listed in the modification's description. To find the actual time it takes to perform the modification, divide the listed base time by the number of successes generated on the **Installation Test**.

**WORKING TIME**
As stated in **The Mechanic Contact** (p. 19), mechanics generally work eight hours a day, five days a week—and they expect to be paid for it! Any more time spent during a work day or work week is overtime and will be charged as such.

If a player character elects to perform a modification himself, he must deal with a different set of restrictions—namely, the amount of time he can devote to the work.

As a rule of thumb (which gamemasters may alter), a character can spend up to six hours a day working on a vehicle and still have time available to meet with contacts, pursue legwork, pay bills and so on. Any more time spent on customization prevents the character from meeting social obligations (resulting in irate landlords, torqued-off friends and significant others, and uncooperative contacts). In fact, if a character spends more than twelve hours performing customization, he cuts into his bodily sustenance time and faces the consequences of sleep deprivation, malnutrition, lack of exercise and so on.

If using the training rules from the **Shadowrun Companion**, keep in mind also that a training day consumes 4 hours a day in study. A character who tries to juggle training and customization has a lot of drek on his plate and will suffer the previously mentioned consequences.

**WEIGHT AND SPACE RESTRICTIONS**
Certain modifications consume cargo space or Load. Not only does this cut into the amount of personnel or cargo a vehicle can carry, but it also limits the modifications a vehicle can carry, because the vehicle cannot exceed its **Cargo** or **Load** ratings.

If desired, riggers and their mechanics can scrape up some extra **CF** by using up the vehicle's "leg room" and utility space. A rigger can scrape up an extra 1.5 **CF** (rounded down) for every passenger seat squeezed into the vehicle this way.

However, scraping up extra **CF** in this manner means that equipment is shoved into areas normally reserved for elbow, leg or head room. This makes the vehicle less comfortable and imposes an additional +3 modifier to all **Damage Resistance Tests** that the character must make to resist crash or collision damage. Furthermore, passengers must resist 4L Stun damage during every round of vehicle combat because they bump and slam into equipment during extreme maneuvering.

Finally, if and when a highway trooper pulls over a rigger for, uh, flying too low through the local speed zone, the cop is much more likely to notice that the rigger's vehicle is "non-standard," and may ask some rather pointed questions (for example, "Do you understand your rights as I have read them to you?").

**INCORPORATING MODIFICATIONS DURING VEHICLE DESIGN**
Any of the listed modifications may be installed during the vehicle design process. In this case, no **Installation Tests** are required. The character simply pays the required **Design Cost** and reduces the vehicle's **CF** and **Load** by the **CF** and **Load** requirements listed in the modification descriptions.

**MODIFICATIONS**
The following modifications may be installed as customizations or during the vehicle-design process.

Engine modifications affect the engine or motor of a vehicle. Control-systems modifications affect the control, driving or piloting of a vehicle. These modifications include rigger adaptation, autonavs and drone pilots. Protective-systems modifications affect the **Armor Rating** of a vehicle or otherwise enhance the protection of the vehicle or its passengers. **Signature** enhancers improve the **Signature Rating** of a vehicle. Weapon-mount modifications improve the vehicle's capacity for mounting weapons and weapon accessories. These modifications do not cover vehicle weapons, ammunition or ordnance. Electronic-systems modifications include sensors, **ECM, ECCM** and other internal electronic systems that aid the vehicle. Miscellaneous modifications/accessories include items such as bucket seats, anti-theft systems and other creature comforts for the metahuman driver of the mid-twenty-first century.

**CUSTOMIZATION AND DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS**
Each modification description includes **Customization Specifications** and **Design Specifications**. A modification's **Customization Specifications** apply when the mod is added as a customization after the vehicle has been manufactured. **Design Specifications** apply when the modification is incorporated during vehicle design.

**Customization Specifications**
* **Parts Cost:** The nuyen cost of the parts required for the modification.
* **Parts Availability:** The **Availability Rating** for the parts or equipment required for the modification.
* **Street Index:** The **Street Index** for the parts or equipment required for the modification.
* **Maximum Improvement or Rating:** The maximum amount of improvement or the highest rating level a vehicle can take in the modification. If the vehicle being customized received the modification during the design process, its existing modification levels count against the maximum.
* **Base Time:** The base time, in hours, required to install the modification onto the vehicle. See **Working Time**, p. 118.
* **Skill:** The relevant skill needed to install and repair the modification. Note that some modifications require more than one skill for successful installation or repair. If this is the case, the character must make successful **Skill Tests** in all listed skills to perform a successful installation or repair.
* **Target Number:** The target number for the **Installation Test**.
* **Equipment Needed:** Specifies the type of tools and working gear needed to perform the installation or repair: kit, shop or facility (see p. 244, SRII, for more information on working kits). Unless otherwise specified, the type of tools required are those for the skill listed under **Skill**.
* **CF Consumed:** The amount of cargo space the modification occupies. Installing modifications may decrease the available cargo space for personal gear, luggage, loot and other goodies. If the vehicle does not have enough CF in its **Cargo Rating** to accommodate the modification, it cannot accept the modification.
* **Load Reduction:** The number of kilograms from the vehicle's **Load Rating** that the modification consumes. Installing the modification may decrease the available **Load Rating** for hauling personal gear, luggage, loot and so on. If the vehicle does not have enough kilograms in its **Load Rating** to accommodate the modification, it cannot accept the modification.

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** The modification's design cost is expressed in **Design Points**. Generally, the cost of a modification varies according to the selected level of improvement, but some modifications have a flat **Design Point** cost.
* **Maximum Rating or Improvement:** This lists the maximum rating or amount of improvement a vehicle can take in the modification.
* **CF Consumed:** This listing is the **CF** that the modification takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep track of the total **Cargo Rating** of the vehicle to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum for the chassis chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough CF in its **Cargo Rating** to accommodate the modification, it cannot accept the modification. Note that installing modifications may decrease available cargo space for storing goodies such as personal gear, luggage, loot and dragon eggs.
* **Load Reduction:** This lists the number of kilograms from the vehicle's **Load Rating** that the modification takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep track of the total **Load Rating** of the vehicle to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum for the power plant chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough kilograms in its **Load Rating** to accommodate the modification, it cannot accept the modification. Installing modifications may decrease the available **Load Rating** for hauling personal gear, luggage, assorted loot and the like.

**ENGINE MODIFICATIONS**
Engine modifications affect a vehicle's power-producing systems. Some modifications improve the performance of the engine and enhance **Speed, Acceleration** or **Load**. Others provide a secondary means of generating power to propel the vehicle.

**Engine Customization**
**Engine customization** involves a radical re-design of an existing engine to perform at levels well beyond normal. **Engine customization** enables a vehicle to exceed the standard maximum **Acceleration, Speed** or **Load Ratings** for that particular type of vehicle, but at the cost of bypassing numerous performance safeguards and thereby greatly increasing the risk of engine failure during operation.

**Engine customization** is usually a vehicle modification, but gamemasters may also use it as a design option to reflect prototype models that have not yet been fully tested. During the vehicle design process, **engine customization** may increase a vehicle's **Speed Rating** above the normal maximum specified on the **Power Plant Table** (p. 167).

**Engine customization** is measured in levels. Each level increases either the **Speed Rating** by 30, **Acceleration** by 2 or **Load** by (**Body** x 50) kilograms. Each rating must be raised separately—in other words, three separate customizations are needed to increase a vehicle's **Speed, Acceleration** and **Load** all by one increment (+30, +2 and + (**Body** x 50)).

To determine the risk of a customized engine failing during operation, the gamemaster makes a secret **Build/Repair Test**. The target number equals the **Installation Test** target number multiplied by 2. If the **engine customization** is performed during the vehicle design process, the gamemaster rolls 6 dice against a Target Number 6. If the test succeeds, the engine will not fail. If the secret test fails, roll 1D6 and divide the result by 2, rounding up. The result is the number of permanent **Stress Points** added to the vehicle. These **Stress Points** cannot be reduced unless a factory-standard engine replaces the customized engine.

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** For the first level of customization, multiply the power plant's **Design Point** cost by 1.25 to determine the customization cost. For each additional level, add another .5 to the **Design Point** multiplier and repeat the calculation.
* **Maximum Improvement:** The maximum improvement is equal to the power plant's maximum **Speed, Acceleration**, or **Load**, multiplied by 1.75 and rounded up.
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**Customization Specifications**
* **Parts Cost:** For the first level of customization, multiply the cost of the original power plant by 1.25. For each additional level of customization, increase the multiplier by .15 and repeat the calculation.
* **Parts Availability:** 8/14 days
* **Street Index:** 2
* **Maximum Improvement:** Multiply the vehicle's **Speed** by 1.5 to determine the new Speed maximum.
* **Base Time:** 40 hours per level
* **Skill:** Appropriate **Vehicle B/R Skill**
* **Target Number:** For ground vehicles and watercraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 3. For drones and hovercraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 4. For aircraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 5.
* **Equipment Needed:** Vehicle facility
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**GridLink™ Power**
The **GridLink™** system provides power to electrical cars through magnetic induction coils buried a few inches under the pavement in cities. Low-friction runners along the vehicle's underbelly induce an electrical current from the magnetic field produced by the roadbed coils. This modification is available only to ground vehicles, not including drones.

Vehicles equipped with **GridLink™** need not worry about power consumption while traveling in the better areas of a city (**Security Rating B** or higher), so long as they stay under the local speed limit. The **GridLink™** system is designed to provide adequate power for vehicles at normal traffic speeds only. If vehicles exceed the speed limit, **GridLink™** cannot provide enough induction power, and so the vehicle must rely on its own power source.

Sometimes, especially in larger cities during rush hour, the **GridLink™** power grid overloads and crashes, leaving many motorists stranded (or at least those who have not recharged their onboard vehicle batteries lately).

**GridLink™** users must pay a monthly usage charge based on the general weight of their vehicles. For standard vehicles, this charge amounts to a number of nuyen per month equal to the vehicle's **Body Rating**, multiplied by 100. For motorcycles, the amount is the cycle's Body multiplied by 25. For trucks and tractors, the figure is the vehicle's Body multiplied by 250.

**Nitrous Oxide Injectors**
**Nitrous oxide injectors** inject nitrous oxide into the air compressor of gasoline and diesel engines, providing a short boost to power output. During vehicle combat, a driver may attempt to use this device to assist in performing the **Accelerating/Braking** action. When making an **Accelerating/Braking Success Test**, the player rolls an additional number of dice equal to the level of the injector.

Additionally, the player may use the device to increase his vehicle's **Speed** to its standard **Speed Rating** multiplied by 2.5. However, the vehicle will decelerate by its **Acceleration Rate** each subsequent turn afterward, until the vehicle's speed falls below its standard **Speed Rating**.

**Nitrous oxide injectors** contain a number of "charges" equal to the injector's level per use (naturally, a driver can opt to use a lower rating to conserve charges). Charges are stored in a pressurized gas cylinder, which can hold up to 20 charges.

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** 55 points per level
* **Maximum Rating:** 6
* **CF Consumed:** 1.5
* **Load Reduction:** 15 kg

**Customization Specifications**

* **Load Reduction:** 15 kg

**SunCell™ Power**
The **SunCell™** system consists of externally mounted solar cells that provide electrical power to the vehicle on a sunny day at a rate equal to the vehicle's **Body** multiplied by 25 PF per hour. The system's power output is reduced by half in cloudy weather and reduced to zero at night or in heavily overcast weather.

Tractors using this modification must mount their **SunCell™** panels on all trailers they are towing.

**SunCell™** systems are compatible with electric-engine driven vehicles. The accessory is not available for motorcycles.

**Turbocharging/Superconductive Drive**
**Turbocharging** improves the speed and acceleration of a methane, gasoline or diesel engine by using a turbine to compress the air that enters the engine's carburetor. A similar modification, called a "**superconductive drive**," provides electric engines with the same performance boosts. For convenience, both modifications follow the same rules and are collectively referred to as "turbocharging."

Each level of turbocharging increases a vehicle's **Speed** by 15 and its **Acceleration** by 10, and reduces its **Signature** by 1. The **Economy** of the vehicle also decreases. To calculate the reduced **Economy Rating**, multiply the vehicle's initial **Economy Rating** by .95. If adding turbocharging during vehicle design, apply the multiplier to the vehicle's **Economy Rating** after Economy effects of all other design options have been applied.

Aircraft (except for electrically powered aircraft) cannot be turbocharged, as their engines incorporate turbocharging as standard equipment.

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** For each improvement level, multiply the power plant's original **Design Point** cost by 1.75.
* **Maximum Improvement:** To determine the new maximum, multiply the vehicle's original maximum Speed by 1.25, then round down. (Note: A vehicle's maximum Speed can always be improved by 1 level.)
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**Customization Specifications**
* **Parts Cost:** Multiply the original vehicle's cost by 1.1 per level to determine the cost of the parts.
* **Parts Availability:** 6/12 days
* **Street Index:** 1.5
* **Maximum Improvement:** Multiply the vehicle's Speed by 1.5 to calculate the new maximum Speed (Note: a vehicle's maximum Speed can always be improved by 1 level.)
* **Base Time:** 8 hours per level
* **Skill:** Appropriate **Vehicle B/R Skill**
* **Target Number:** For ground vehicles and watercraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 2. For drones and hovercraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 3. For electrically powered aircraft, the target number equals the number of customization levels plus 4.
* **Equipment Needed:** Vehicle facility
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** 0 kg

**CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS**
Control-system modifications affect the operation or handling of the vehicle in one way or another. Some modifications enhance ease of control and thus reduce the vehicle's **Handling Rating**. Others, such as rigger adaptation or autonavigation systems, provide alternate or supplementary methods of controlling a vehicle.

**Adjusted Controls**
Standard manual vehicle controls (steering wheels, foot pedals, dashboards and so on) are arranged to accommodate humans, elves and orks.

Dwarfs and trolls, because of their unusual sizes, have difficulty using such controls. Dwarf legs are too short to reach foot pedals and most dashboard controls will be out of a dwarf's reach. Likewise, trolls attempting to drive will experience difficulty when attempting to manipulate standard-sized controls with their huge hands and feet. **Adjusted controls** are modified to fit the ergonomic needs of dwarfs and trolls and solve these problems.

If a dwarf or troll attempts to drive a vehicle with standard controls, he receives +3 target modifiers on all driving-related **Success Tests**. Likewise, if humans, elves or orks attempt to drive vehicles with adjusted controls, they receive +3 target modifiers on all driving-related **Success Tests**. Furthermore, dwarfs cannot drive vehicles with controls adjusted for trolls, and vice versa.

Note that size does not matter when driving a rigged vehicle using a datajack.

**Adjusted controls** are also available for any metahumans with disabilities that prevent them from using standard controls.

Note that vehicles with **adjusted controls** may be harder to come by, more expensive or simply unavailable in areas unfriendly to metahumans.

**Autonavigation Systems**
**Autonavigation systems** are available for most vehicles. The effects of each basic type of system—**Rating 1, Rating 2** and **Rating 3**—are described in the following entries.

The **Autonav Rating** also represents extra dice the rigger can add to standard **Driving Tests**. In combat, however, the autonav system works against the character because its safety-conscious programming runs counter to vehicle combat. In this case, the system's rating is added to test target numbers. See **The Driving Test** in **Standard Vehicle Operations** (p. 20) and the **Vehicle Combat** section for more information on these effects.

**Rating 2, Rating 3** and **Rating 4** autonav systems are also capable of controlling a vehicle without input from the driver. In these cases, assume that the vehicle has the appropriate **Vehicle Control Skill** at a rating equal to its **Autonav Rating**.

**Rating 1 Autonav**
**Rating 1 autonav** consists of rudimentary collision detection/avoidance systems. It comes with **Level 0 Sensors**, which consist primarily of ultrasound and basic radar systems that detect the presence of other objects. However, the **Rating 1 autonav** system cannot control a vehicle by itself.

**Rating 1 autonav** is the only type of autonav that can be fitted to a motorcycle that does not have rigger-control gear installed.

**Rating 2 Autonav**
**Rating 2 autonav** is capable of self-navigation and is equipped with radio transponders that can communicate with a traffic-control grid system, such as the the European ALI system. After receiving traffic data from such systems, the autonav can suggest alternate routes to a destination. Using a standard map chip (available for all major urban areas, 25 nuyen each), a **Rating 2 autonav** system can also follow any route mapped out along terrain not classified as rough. Rough terrain (where off-road penalties apply) rapidly overwhelms the system's collision-avoidance software and all relevant target numbers are doubled.

**Rating 4 autonav** systems are the most sophisticated autonav systems available to private individuals. These systems can operate in urban and off-road terrain, as long as the appropriate map chips are provided (see **Rating 3 Autonav**). A **Rating 4** system can plan its own route if given destination instructions and modify its programmed route to the next most appropriate route if local conditions make a course modification desirable.

### Contingency Maneuver Controls (CMCs)

Contingency maneuver controls (**CMCs**) consist of redundant wiring, secondary circuit breakers and backup systems. **CMCs** allow a vehicle to ignore, to a limited extent, the effects of vehicle damage on driving and control of the vehicle.

**CMCs** allow the vehicle to ignore the effects of a number of boxes of vehicle damage equal to the rating of the **CMC** system. For example, a vehicle with **Rating 3 CMCs** does not suffer any damage modifiers when taking Light or Moderate vehicle damage. Once the damage passes the Moderate level, however, all damage and Initiative modifiers apply per standard rules.

Note that even if a vehicle has **Rating 9 CMCs**, it will be destroyed when it suffers damage at the Deadly level. **CMCs** keep the vehicle running at peak performance instead of slowly degrading performance as damage accumulates, up until the point of destruction.

**CMCs** do not compensate for damage modifiers applied to riggers suffering from Physical or Mental Damage.

**Datajack Port**

A datajack port provides a rigger with direct control of a vehicle and also enables any individual equipped with a datajack to plug into the vehicle and control it with rudimentary cybernetic commands. However, increase a character's **Reaction Rating** by 1 when he controls the vehicle without rigger adaptation or vehicle control rig cyberware.

Vehicle control rig cyberware cannot properly interface with a simple datajack link. A full vehicle-control rig is required to receive the full **Reaction** and Initiative bonuses of the cyberware.

**Drive-by-Wire Systems**

**Drive-by-wire systems** substitute advanced computer-controlled maneuvering systems for standard mechanical or basic electronic steering controls.

**Drive-by-wire systems** are available at levels 1, 2 and 3. Each level of drive-by-wire reduces a vehicle's **Handling** by 1. Additionally, the system reduces a vehicle's overall weight and provides a one-time increase to the vehicle's **Acceleration, Speed** and **Load Ratings**.

To calculate the one-time increase, multiply the desired rating by .10. If desired, the multiplier can be split among two or three ratings. For example, the player may increase the **Acceleration Rating** by .03, **Speed Rating** by .03 and **Load Rating** by .04. Or the player may increase the **Acceleration Rating** by the drive-by-wire system's level multiplied by .06, and the **Speed Rating** by the system's level multiplied by .04.

The multiplier increase is not cumulative per level of drive-by-wire. A vehicle with a **Rating 3** drive-by-wire system receives the same .10 multiplier as a vehicle with a **Rating 1** drive-by-wire system.

To install a drive-by-wire system as a vehicle customization, the rigger or mechanic must make three separate successful tests—an appropriate **Vehicle B/R (4) Test**, a **Computer (4) Test**, and an **Electronics (4) Test**. Successes from all three tests may be used to reduce the base time for the modification.

**Off-Road Suspension**

**Off-road suspension** improves off-road **Handling** at the expense of on-road **Handling, Speed** and fuel consumption. This modification is available only to wheeled ground vehicles and is compatible with drive-by-wire systems.

Each level of **off-road suspension** reduces the vehicle's off-road **Handling Rating** by 1, while increasing the on-road **Handling Rating** by 1. The installation of **off-road suspension**, regardless of how many levels of improvement are made, reduces on-road **Speed** by 15 and off-road **Speed** by 30. It also increases the vehicle's **Economy** by a varying amount, depending on the type of vehicle (see **Off-Road Suspension Table**, below).

During vehicle design, levels of **off-road suspension** are not subject to the limit of the chassis' original **Handling Rating**. However, the modification cannot raise or lower the vehicle's ratings by more than 2.

**Off-road handling** is compatible with the improved-suspension modification.

**Remote-Control Interfaces**

The remote-control interface enables a vehicle to receive and transmit data from and to a remote-control network so that a rigger can control the vehicle via the network. The remote-control interface also gives the vehicle a **Pilot Rating** that reflects the vehicle's level of semi-autonomy. This modification does not apply to standard drones, which are automatically equipped with remote-control hardware and software. Vehicles adapted for remote control start with an initial **Pilot Rating 1**.

**Remote Pilot Advanced Programming**

The advanced programming option is required if the character desires a **Pilot Rating** greater than 1.
* A **Level 1 Pilot** is a simple system that does exactly what it's told and is easily confused.
* A **Level 2 Pilot** is an enhanced system with limited autonomy and the ability to interpret commands with slight latitude. **Level 2 Pilot** programming is the highest-level pilot system that the public can buy without a security license.
* A **Level 3 Pilot** is an advanced system and possesses roughly the same intelligence and comprehension level as an average metahuman. **Level 3 Pilots** are generally found on the gray or shadow markets.
* **Level 4 Pilot** systems are security-grade drone pilots. **Level 4** systems employ sophisticated expert systems and fuzzy-logic controls that give a drone the equivalent tactical intelligence of a well-trained company man.
* **Level 5 Pilots** are military-grade drone pilots. Possessing the latest advances in expert systems, fuzzy logic and neural-network pattern recognition, **Level 5 Pilots** are the equal of battle-savvy soldiers or pilots who've logged more than a thousand hours of flight duty. **Level 5** is also the highest known Pilot level in production (rumors abound of **Level 6** or higher Pilots that employ proto-artificial intelligence, but no proof—definitive or circumstantial—exists to back up these rumors).

**PROTECTIVE SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS**

Protective-system modifications help protect a vehicle and its passengers. Protective systems include vehicle armor, crash cages, **EnviroSeal™** and life-support systems.

**Standard Armor**
**Standard vehicle armor** consists of hardened ceramic and metallic panels that protect both vehicle and passengers from attacks. Each level of armor increases the **Armor Rating** of the vehicle by 1 point.

Armor adds weight as well. Each level of armor adds (**Body** x **Body** x 5) kilograms to the vehicle, which are counted against the vehicle's **Load Rating**. Vehicles cannot carry more armor than their **Load Ratings** allow.

Armor also increases a vehicle's **Handling Rating**, because maneuvering vehicles becomes more difficult as the vehicle's weight increases. For every 6 points of Armor added, increase the **Handling** of the vehicle by 1.

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** 50 points per **Armor Point**
* **Maximum Rating:** Limited by armor weight and vehicle **Load Rating**
* **CF Consumed:** 0
* **Load Reduction:** (**Body** x **Body** x 5) kilograms per **Armor Point**

* **Target Number:** Desired **Armor Rating** + 3
* **Equipment Needed:** Vehicle facility
* **CF Consumed:** 0 CF
* **Load Reduction:** (**Body** x **Body** x 5) kilograms per **Armor Point**

**Concealed Armor**
Even casual observers can easily discern standard armor on a vehicle. **Concealed armor** is hidden in a vehicle's interior spaces so that anyone attempting to detect it must make a **Perception Test**. To determine the test target number, divide the **Armor Rating** by 3, then subtract the result from 9 and round up.

**Concealed armor** reduces the interior cargo space; if a vehicle's available cargo space cannot accommodate the desired **Armor Rating**, the character must either reduce the **Armor Rating** or use standard armor.

**Concealed armor** is not compatible with standard armor. (After all, what's the point of installing concealed armor, when installing standard armor on top of it blatantly gives away the fact that the vehicle is armored?)

**Design Specifications**
* **Design Cost:** 50 points per level

* **Equipment Needed:** Vehicle facility
* **CF Consumed:** 3 CF per **Armor Point**
* **Load Reduction:** (**Body** x **Body** x 5) kilograms per **Armor Point**

**Ablative Armor**
**Ablative armor** consists of dozens or hundreds of small, square, ceramic-metallic plates, roughly 10 centimeters long on each side. When a projectile or explosion strikes a vehicle, some of the ablative plates blow off the vehicle and deflect part of the damaging energy of the attack.

**Ablative armor** adds twice its level to a vehicle's **Armor Rating**, to a maximum equal to the vehicle's **Body**. When struck by a weapon that has a Power greater than 3 times the total modified **Armor Rating**, reduce the ablative armor level by 1. **Ablative armor** is not hardened and thus does not stage down the damage code of attacks.

Installing or replacing ablative armor plates takes 6 hours and does not require any **Skill Test**. **Ablative armor** is not available as a design option, cannot be installed on aircraft and is not concealable.

Regardless of its level, **ablative armor** reduces the vehicle's available Load by (**Body** x 100) kilograms. **Ablative armor** does not consume **CF**. A vehicle with **ablative armor** is automatically considered security- or military-grade.

**Advanced Passenger Protection Systems (APPS™)**
The **APPS™** system consists of specially secured seat belts, additional impact-activated air bags in all passenger positions, and special reinforcement of a vehicle's interior body panels.

In a crash, the system reduces the Power of crash damage by half. To exit the vehicle following such a crash, however, requires a **Strength (5) Test**.

**EnviroSeal™ System**
The **EnviroSeal™** system provides a vehicle with gas-tight (or watertight) seals. Note that opening windows, doors, or hatches breaks the integrity of the seal for as long as the windows, doors or hatches remain open. Note also that this system does not provide life support for a vehicle's occupants. For submersible operations, a vehicle's engine compartment must be sealed separately.

Light damage to a sealed vehicle breaches the seal. Emergency slap-patches that can handle holes made by light damage are available at a modest cost of 5 nuyen each. Of course, some contamination may penetrate even if the hole is sealed relatively quickly. Moderate vehicle damage or worse cannot be sealed without work on the vehicle.

**EnviroSeal™** is not available for motorcycles.

**Cabin overpressurization:** This additional option is available with all **EnviroSeal™** systems. A cabin-overpressurization system uses air pumps to increase the air pressure inside a vehicle's cabin, so that external contaminants are kept out of the vehicle if a window, door or hatch is opened or a light-damage breach occurs. This option is commonly incorporated in emergency rescue, decontamination and reconnaissance vehicles designed for use in hazardous, toxic or NBC (Nuclear/Biological/Chemical) contamination areas.

Cabin overpressurization does not work underwater or if the vehicle sustains Moderate or greater damage.

**Smart Armor Systems (SAS)**
**Smart,** or "proactive," **armor systems** use small hexagonal explosive cells, each approximately 5 centimeters in diameter and 10 centimeters high. A fine wire mesh of sensitive electrical circuitry is suspended approximately 1 meter away from the skin of the vehicle. Whenever a projectile penetrates the wire mesh, the penetration is relayed to a system computer that instantaneously determines the size and impact location of the projectile, then detonates a portion of the explosive cells to offset or deflect the projectile's impact.

In game terms, whenever a projectile strikes his smart-armor-equipped vehicle, the player controlling the vehicle rolls 2 dice, adds the results together and compares that result to the **Activation Target Number**. The first time a projectile strikes the vehicle, the **Activation Target Number** is 3. For each successive hit (regardless of whether or not it causes damage), increase the target number by 1. Note that a burst fire or full autofire attack counts as one "hit" for these purposes.

If the roll result is greater than or equal to the **Activation Target Number**, the smart armor reduces the damage code of all attacks by one level. Standard reductions for standard munition attacks against vehicles apply as well, so the damage codes of standard bullets and explosives are reduced by two levels (**D** to **M**, **S** to **L**, **M** or lower to no damage). Damage codes for anti-vehicle munitions are reduced by one level.

Dangerous Dave is a Desert Rat marine based at the **Twenty-Nine Palms Combat Center** in the Mojave Desert. Dave is driving the Murdilizer, a Ferrari Appaloosa equipped with **SAS**, into a running gun battle with some Aztechnology-backed mercs attempting to grab some telesma material from the **Joshua Tree National Monument**.

During the first Combat Turn, the Murdilizer takes a hit from a barrage of heavy machine gun fire (damage 10S, boosted up to 16D to account for full autofire). The Appaloosa hasn't been hit yet, so Dave rolls 2D6 against an **Activation Target Number** 3. The test generates a 5, so the smart armor stages the damage down to 16S. Additionally, the machine gun is not firing anti-vehicle munitions, so the damage is staged down another level to 16M (per standard vehicle damage rules, p. 53). Consequently, Dave makes the Appaloosa's **Resistance Test** against 16M damage (minus Armor modifiers).

During the next Combat Turn, an Aguilar attack helicopter pops up over a mesa and lobs a **Block II Outlaw AVM** (damage 20D) at the Murdilizer. The Appaloosa has already taken one hit, so the **Activation Target Number** increases from 3 to 4. Dave rolls 2D6 but gets only a 2. The **SAS** fails to function, and the **AVM** hits the Appaloosa full on. To compound the bad luck, the **Outlaw** is an anti-vehicle munition, so its damage code is not staged down against vehicles. Dave must therefore make a **Damage Resistance Test** against 20D damage, with half the Murdilizer's **Armor Rating** applying against the attack's Power. (Now you know why the other jarheads call him "Dangerous Dave.")

After a vehicle's smart armor has taken a hit, the character can replace the expended explosive cells. Doing so returns the **Activation Target Number** to 3 for the next attack against the vehicle. The repair takes approximately eight hours and requires no **Skill Test**.

To install **smart armor** as a vehicle customization, the rigger or mechanic must make three successful **Skill Tests**—a **Demolitions Build/Repair Test**, an **Electronics Test** and a **Computer Test**. **Smart armor** is not available for vehicles with **Body Ratings** lower than 4, and it cannot be concealed.

If **smart armor** is incorporated during the vehicle design process, the vehicle is considered military-grade.

**SIGNATURE MODIFICATIONS**
**Signature modifications** reduce or mask a vehicle's thermographic or radar profile and make detecting the vehicle more difficult for sensor systems.

**Thermal Baffles**
**Thermal baffles** are heat-blocking and absorbing materials added to the chassis of a vehicle to reduce its thermal signature. This makes detecting and locking on to the vehicle harder for infrared sensors.

**Thermal baffles** are available only for vehicles with gasoline, methane, diesel and jet engines. Like vehicle armor, **thermal baffles** are heavy materials. Each point of thermal baffle weighs (**Body** x 50) kilograms, which counts against the vehicle's **Load Rating**.

Players also need to keep separate track of the total rating of thermal masking on a vehicle, because that rating serves as a positive modifier on any **Perception Tests** made against the vehicle that involve non-vehicle thermographic detection techniques.

**Active Thermal Masking**
**Active thermal masking** is a high-powered coolant system that temporarily absorbs heat generated by the vehicle's power plant. This modification is available only for customized gasoline, methane, diesel and jet engines, except for motorcycle engines (see **Engine Modifications**, p. 120). Each level of **engine customization** allows one level of active masking, and each level of active masking increases the vehicle's **Signature** by 1.

During operation, the vehicle loses 15 meters per turn to its **Speed Rating** for each level of masking activated, and the vehicle cannot exceed its adjusted **Speed Rating**. The system runs for a duration equal to (60 - [masking x 5]) minutes. Running the coolant system longer than the indicated duration produces 1 **Stress Point** per minute and forces the vehicle to make a **Stress Test** each minute (see **Stress**, p. 25). Characters can switch off the masking system before the end of the specified duration.

At the end of the duration, the masking system must shut down for ten minutes to vent accumulated heat. During this period the vehicle **Signature** falls to 2, regardless of any other **Signature** modifiers in effect.

**Radar-Absorbent Materials (RAM)**
**Radar-absorbent materials (RAM)** consist of special coatings and enamels that absorb radar signals and convert them into heat or small magnetic fields. As a result, the vehicle reflects back very little radar energy, making it harder for sensors to detect and lock on to it. Each level of **RAM** coating applied to a vehicle increases its **Signature** by 1, up to a maximum improvement of +3.

**RAM** is extremely hard to obtain, even for licensed security agencies. Normally, **RAM** is available to military agencies. Therefore, if players or gamemasters incorporate **RAM** as part of a vehicle during vehicle design, the vehicle is automatically considered military grade.

**VEHICLE WEAPON MOUNTS**
Vehicle weapon mounts use the weight of the vehicle to stabilize the weapon against the vehicle's movement and to provide some recoil resistance as well. Though ostensibly licensed only to law enforcement, private security and military organizations, a number of general-purpose vehicle-weapon mounts are available on the shadow market. Certain weapons require certain special mounts; those requirements are described in the appropriate weapon descriptions.

A vehicle's **Body Rating** determines the number of hardpoints and firmpoints it can accommodate. In turn, the vehicle's hardpoints and firmpoints determine the number of weapon mounts the vehicle can accommodate. See **Body Rating and Weapon Mounts**, p. 22.

Each hardpoint is worth 2 points and each firmpoint counts for 1 point. The total point value of all the hardpoints and firmpoints on a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle's **Body Rating**. Heavy weapons (MMGs and larger) and vehicle weapons must be mounted on hardpoints. LMGs and small arms (assault rifles and smaller) can be mounted on firmpoints.

Motorcycles with medium or larger sidecars and sufficient Body can accommodate 1 hardpoint. The hardpoint can only take a forward-firing fixed weapon mount and must be in the sidecar (see **Sidecars**, p. 146).

If players or gamemasters incorporate weapon mounts during vehicle design, the vehicle receives the additional **Mark-Up Factor** multiplier for security- or military-grade vehicles.

**Firearm Conversion Kits**
A **firearm conversion kit** is required for mounting any personal firearm, from pistols to man-portable heavy weapons to fixed mounts or turrets. Conversion kits are not required to mount firearms on pintle or ring mounts.

To convert a firearm for mounting on a vehicle, the character must make an appropriate **Weapon B/R (4) Test**. The base time is 12 hours. Additionally, the character needs a **Weapons Kit** (see p. 244, SRII) to make the conversion.

Any accessories, features or properties that are part of the weapon are also available when it is mounted as a vehicle weapon. However, external weapon accessories that are not part of the weapon cannot be fitted onto the converted weapon, with the exception of the smartgun system, which must be installed internally (p. 241, SRII). Converted firearms do not consume **CF** (though the mounts onto which they are fitted do).

**Firearm conversion kits** are not needed for weapons specifically designed to be mounted on vehicles, such as the water cannon from SRII, the Ares Firelance™ vehicle laser from **Fields of Fire**, or any of the vehicle weapons from this sourcebook.

**Fixed Mounts**
A **fixed mount** is a hardpoint or firmpoint with a weapon permanently affixed to it. **Fixed mounts** fire in a fixed arc (no more than 5 degrees to either side, up or down), so a driver "aims" the fixed-mount weapon by moving his vehicle. **Fixed mounts** commonly face forward or to the rear; side-facing mounts tend to interfere with a vehicle's handling. (Add the weapon's recoil to the vehicle's normal **Handling Rating** when a side-facing mount is fired. The driver must make a **Driving Test** against the increased **Handling Rating** or crash. Double the recoil modifiers for hovercraft; triple them for watercraft).

Single **fixed-mount** weapons must be placed directly along the vehicle's center line. Twin mounts may sit either side-by-side along the center line or may be placed on the left and right fairings of the vehicle. If different weapons are mounted on **fixed mounts**, both must sit side-by-side along the center line, to limit recoil imbalance (which is really bad for vehicle handling).

**Fixed mounts** reduce recoil modifiers by half before applying recoil compensation from any accessories. Thus, they cancel the double-recoil modifier for heavy weapons. **Fixed mounts** may be remotely operated by a gunner or by the rigger jacked into the vehicle.

**Fixed mounts** may be configured as external or internal mounts. External **fixed mounts** are easily seen by casual observers and are not protected by a vehicle's armor. Consequently, external mounts decrease a vehicle's **Signature** by 1.

Weapons on internal mounts are protected by the vehicle's armor and receive the benefit of Concealability (except when firing), but do not decrease the vehicle's **Signature**. An observer who makes a successful **Perception (3) Test** can spot an internal weapon mount but will not immediately deduce what the mount is used for. During vehicle combat, the controlling character must spend a Complex Action to extend or stow a weapon on an internal mount. While a weapon is armed, it is not protected by the vehicle's armor and it reduces the vehicle's **Signature** by 1.

**Gunnery Recoil Adjusters**
The **gunnery recoil adjuster** is a unique form of recoil compensation available for vehicle weapons. The adjuster consists of high-precision micro-actuators that replace the weapon mount's servo-motors. When the weapon is fired, the actuators lower the weapon in minute increments to compensate for the effects of recoil.

In game terms, recoil adjusters work in the same way as standard recoil compensators do (see **Recoil Compensation**, p. 90, SRII). Each level of recoil adjuster negates 1 point of recoil.

**Gunnery recoil adjusters** are available for fixed mounts and turrets only. Recoil adjusters are not compatible with vehicle gyro-stabilization, because the rotational momentum interferes with the micro-actuators' minute adjustments.

**External Missile and Rocket Mounts**
Because of their size, missiles and rockets use slightly different rules for fixed weapon mounts. Though every missile and rocket firing system takes up one firmpoint, the number and types of missiles or rockets carried in different systems vary, depending on the size of the vehicle.

For ground vehicles, externally mounted missiles and rockets sit on roof-rack mounts. Civilian vehicles armed in this manner must also have **roll bars** for recoil stability. A vehicle may carry a number of missiles or rockets equal to its **Body Rating** in this manner. Rockets and missiles mounted externally receive no protection from the vehicle's armor and they reduce the **Signature** of the vehicle by 1, regardless of the number of missiles or rockets mounted.

Aircraft and helicopters generally carry rockets and missiles on pinions under their wings, fairings and fuselages. An aircraft may carry a number of external mounts equal to its **Body Rating**. Every two external mounts installed on an aircraft reduce its **Signature** by 1. Each aircraft mount may carry up to 300 kilograms of missiles or rockets.

In all cases, remember that a vehicle cannot carry more missiles or rockets than its **Load Rating** allows. And missiles—particularly anti-vehicle missiles—can be very heavy.

**Internal Missile and Rocket Mounts**
Internal rocket and missile mounts do not decrease a vehicle's **Signature** and receive the benefit of the vehicle's armor protection. An internal rocket or missile mount takes up one firmpoint. However, the number of missiles or rockets a vehicle can carry is limited by the vehicle's **CF**. For every 3 **CF**, a vehicle can carry 2 missiles or rockets. The mounting actuators consume an additional 2 **CF**.

To fire an internally stored rocket or missile, the driver must open the weapon bay door and arm the rocket or missile. While the missile is armed and ready to fire, the vehicle's **Signature** decreases by 1, until the munition is fired or is stowed back in its storage place. Arming or stowing a munition requires one Complex Action.

In all cases, remember that a vehicle cannot carry more missiles or rockets than its **Load Rating** will allow. An aircraft or helicopter can carry a number of internal mounts equal to half its **Body Rating**.

**Pintle Mounts**
**Pintle mounts**, the simplest mounts available, consist of simple reinforced holes and swivels mounted into the side of a vehicle. **Pintle mounts** accept any firmpoint-sized weapon. Firing arcs are generally 60 degrees to the left and right and 30 degrees up and down (which allows the vehicle to engage low-flying aircraft at a height of less than half the weapon's long-range value). **Pintle mounts** count as one firmpoint.

To mount a weapon on or remove a weapon from a **pintle mount** requires a Complex Action; if the vehicle is moving, it also requires a **Quickness (3) Test**. Drone pilots and riggers jacked into the vehicle cannot remotely control **pintle mounts**. Weapons in a **pintle mount** receive the equivalent of 2 points of recoil compensation.

**Ring Mounts**
**Ring mounts** are a step up from the basic **pintle mount**. **Ring mounts** consist of a freely rotating ring set on the top of a vehicle, with a tripod assembly attached to the ring; the gunner stands in the middle of the ring to fire the weapon. The ring rotates in a full circle, but its vertical traversing remains 30 degrees upwards or downwards. Mounting or dismounting a weapon from a **ring mount** requires a Complex Action, as well as a **Quickness (3) Test** if the vehicle is moving.

**Ring mounts** may only be mounted on hardtop vehicles or on open-top or convertible vehicles equipped with roll bars. **Ring mounts** installed on helicopters are actually door guns, which require the gunner to open the door on one side to fire out (and also exposes the pilot, crew and the rest of the helicopter interior to incoming fire).

**Ring mounts** count as a hardpoint and can mount any man-portable heavy weapon, as well as LMGs. **Ring mounts** cannot be remotely controlled by a drone pilot or a rigger jacked into the vehicle. Weapons on a **ring mount** receive the equivalent of 6 points of recoil compensation.

**Smartlink Integration Kits**
The **smartlink integration kit** is an interface that connects smartgun-equipped weapons mounted in fixed mounts and turrets with gunners who are equipped with smartlink cyberware. Without the integration kit, smartgun-equipped weapons mounted in fixed mounts or turrets do not gain the benefit of the smartlink during **Manual Gunnery Tests**.

Remember that gunners must have smartlink cyberware to take full advantage of the smartlink system. If the gunner using a vehicle smartgun does not have smartlink cyberware, treat the gunner as if he is wearing smartgoggles (see p. 90, SRII).

The gunner need not be jacked into the vehicle to take full advantage of the smartlink system. The **smartlink integration kit** also contains palm-induction links for weapon controls.

Remember that smartlink modifiers do not apply to **Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery** or **Missile Attack Tests**.

The **smartlink integration kit** is not necessary for weapons mounted on pintle or ring mounts.

**Turrets**
Turrets are motorized, armored ring mounts. Turrets provide weapons with armor protection but also increase a vehicle's profile. Consequently, a turret reduces a vehicle's **Signature** by 1.

Civilian vehicles can mount turrets only if they are already equipped with roll bars.

Turrets come in six sizes: micro, mini, small, medium, large and extra-large. Micro turrets, which are found on large drones and pickup-sized trucks, take up one hardpoint and have a Weapon Value of 2. Mini turrets, found on most anti-riot vehicles, take up two hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 3. Small turrets, installed mostly on heavy security vehicles or armored personnel carriers, take up three hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 6. Medium turrets, which are found on light tanks or heavy gunships, take up four hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 8. Large turrets belong almost exclusively to heavy main battle tanks, take up six hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 10. Extra-large turrets are mounted on military aircraft and warships, take up eight hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 12. However, standard rigger characters do not have access to such turrets and vehicles. The weapon values of all weapons mounted on a turret may not exceed the turret's weapon value, per the **Weapon Values Table**.

All turrets have a 360-degree firing arc, with -10 degrees depression and 45 degrees elevation. Some turrets also have additional internal space that can accommodate ammunition bins, smoke launchers, sensor systems, electronics packages and the like. Micro turrets provide 1 CF of additional space, mini turrets 2 CF, small turrets 4 CF and medium turrets 6 CF. Large and extra-large turrets do not have any additional internal space for ammunition bins, but they do have internal seating for two.

When firing turret-mounted weapons, reduce recoil modifiers by half before applying recoil compensation from any accessories. Consequently, turrets cancel the double-recoil modifier for heavy weapons. Turrets are manually operated by a turret gunner.

**Anti-Aircraft Turrets**
**Anti-aircraft capable turrets** can elevate to a maximum angle of 75 degrees, which allows weapons on them to fire at aircraft at a height lower than 95 percent of the weapon's long-range value. Multiply the design or parts cost for such turrets by 1.5 and increase the standard CF Consumed by 1 CF. The turret's **Load Reduction** remains the same.


### Pop-Up Turrets

Pop-up turrets remain concealed from plain view until their weapons are used. While they are concealed, the standard -1 penalty to the vehicle's **Signature** does not apply. To "pop up" this kind of turret for operation, the gunner must spend a Complex Action.

The turret weapon is ready for use on the next available Action.

Pop-up turrets have weapon values 1 point lower than standard weapon values. **CF** consumption for these turrets is double the standard **CF** consumption. Large or extra-large turrets cannot be constructed with pop-up capability.

### Remote Turrets

Remote turrets are weapons-only mounts that the operator controls from inside the passenger compartment via remote sensors. A separate gunner or a rigger may operate a remote turret (military vehicles often use two riggers, one controlling the vehicle and the other controlling the turret).

Remote turrets are available in micro, mini, small and medium sizes. Micro turrets, normally installed on smaller drones, take up 1 firmpoint and have a Weapon Value of 1.

Both anti-aircraft capability and pop-up options are available for remote turrets. Pop-up micro-turrets have a Weapon Value of 0 and take up 1 **CF**.

Large and extra-large remote turrets exist, but they are used only on large warships, such as destroyers and cruisers, which are out of the price range of most shadowrunners.

### Vehicle Gyroscopic Stabilizers

Vehicle gyroscopic stabilizers are available for weapons mounted in fixed mounts and turrets. As with normal weapon gyros, every point of vehicle gyro-stabilization reduces the combined modifiers for recoil and movement (the latter applies only to vehicles moving by means of mechanical legs).

There is, however, a drawback to gyro-stabilization. The rotational momentum generated by a gyroscope tends to interfere with the maneuverability of a vehicle. If the total active gyroscopic stabilization rating is greater than the vehicle's Body, the vehicle receives a +1 modifier to its Handling for every point of gyro-stabilization greater than the vehicle's Body.

Vehicle gyro-stabilization is not compatible with gunnery recoil adjusters.

### Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)

Electronic countermeasures include active devices such as barrage radio jammers, infrared jammers, chaff and flare dispensers, and wave harmonic disrupters that confound sensor systems and jam the communications of opposing remote control operations. See **ECM** (p. 31) for more information.

Though normally restricted to security and military agencies, several low-level **ECM** systems are available on the public market. These are sold primarily to celebrities and VIPs as a defense against prying eyes armed with intrusive drones and sensors.

### Electronic Deception (ED)

Electronic deception measures are devices that feed sensors false information about the target's range, position, direction of travel and so on. Electronic deception is more subtle and insidious than **ECM**; a sensor won't know it's being deceived until the metahuman controller physically sees the target with his own eyes or video feeds. For more information on the use of electronic deception, see **Electronic Deception** (p. 32).

**ED** systems are generally restricted to security and military agencies and are almost impossible to come by on the streets.

### ACCESSORIES

What's a rigger vehicle without custom, hand-picked accessories? The following descriptions present a wide assortment of items designed to custom-tailor any vehicle to a rigger's satisfaction.

**Aircraft Drop Tanks**
Drop tanks may be attached under an aircraft's wings or fuselage in lieu of rocket/missile mounts. For every two external mounts sacrificed, a pair of drop tanks may be added. (Drop tanks are installed in pairs to maintain aerodynamic balance.)

Each drop tank can hold 1,000 liters of fuel, so a pair of drop tanks increases an aircraft's fuel supply by 2,000 liters. Installing drop tanks on an aircraft decreases its **Signature** by 1. Each additional pair of drop tanks decreases the aircraft's **Speed** by 15, and every two pairs of drop tanks increases the vehicle's **Handling** by 1. Mounting drop tanks on an aircraft takes ten minutes.

The pilot may jettison drop tanks if he spends a Complex Action for that purpose. The aircraft's flight characteristics immediately return to their standard values. The cost of a pair of drop tanks is 8,000¥. Drop tanks have a Body of 1 and 3 **Armor Points**.

**Amphibious Operation Packages**
Amphibious-operation packages are used to modify ground vehicles for amphibious operations. If the vehicle has watertight seals and life support, it can be used for underwater operations.

Three types of amphibious-operation packages are available: Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3.

**Level 1 Package**
The **Level 1 package** uses the vehicle's wheels as the source of motive power and enables a vehicle to travel through water at a speed of 15 meters per turn. While operating in this manner, the vehicle receives a +2 **Handling** modifier.

Note that surface operations may be performed by vehicles with unsealed engines. To perform submarine operations, however, a vehicle must have a sealed power plant.

**Anti-Theft Systems**
**Anti-theft systems** come in all shapes and sizes and are rated from 1 to 10. The system rating represents the number of dice rolled in opposed tests made against intruders. The intruder uses an appropriate skill (normally the **Electronics (Maglocks) Concentration**) in the test.

If the intruder wins, he overrides the anti-theft system and can enter and hot-wire the vehicle for operation. If the system wins, the appropriate anti-theft action occurs, depending on what the designer installed. Some common anti-theft actions are listed below. The gamemaster and players should work together to define the exact parameters of the system.

**Automated Call:** The vehicle makes an automatic call to Lone Star, the **PANICBUTTON** system or a similar security service. The vehicle must be equipped with a portable phone installed in an electronics port.

**Electric Shock:** An electrical current ripples through the outer shell of the vehicle, giving a nasty shock to the would-be thief. The voltage level (and appropriate damage) varies, depending on the whim of the driver. As a general rule, a standard shock system does the same damage as a **Defiance Super Shock** taser (10S Stun). Lethal shocks (doing physical damage) are possible, though they are illegal in most countries (not as if that's stopped shadowrunners in the past, though).

A standard shock system costs an additional 2,000 nuyen, or 20 **Design Points**. Gamemasters are free to raise the price even higher for an anti-theft system that gives lethal electric shocks.

**Explosion:** Characters who really hate vehicle thieves can set up their anti-theft systems to blow up the vehicle with plastic explosives (either **Compound IV** or **Compound XII**). As a general rule, vehicles must be packed with enough plastic explosives to deliver a Power equal to the square of their **Body Ratings** (see p. 242, SRII, for computing Power for plastic explosives). The explosion destroys the vehicle and inflicts explosive damage on the would-be intruder—as well as on passengers, cargo and anyone passing by.

For damage to the vehicle's passengers, cargo, and bystanders in the immediate vicinity, reduce the damage Power Level by the Vehicle's **Body** or **Armor Rating**, whichever is higher. For a more powerful effect, the player installing the system can make a **Demolitions (4) Test** during installation. If the test succeeds, reduce by half the **Body** or **Armor Rating** for this calculation. In any case, the damage Power Level drops by 1 for each meter of distance from the vehicle.

"Nine-Fingers" Ned is trying to break into a Mitsubishi Nightsky protected by an anti-theft system. Unfortunately, he botches the attempt (how do you think he got the tag "Nine-Fingers"?) and triggers the limousine's alarm system. The system detonates a charge of **Compound IV**.

The Nightsky has a **Body Rating 4**, so the blast must have a minimum Power equal to 4², or 16, to destroy the vehicle (along with the would-be thief). Unfortunately for Ned, the limousine's been packed with 4 kilograms of **Compound IV**, which gives it a Power Level of 18. (See the plastic explosive rules, p. 242 of SRII, to determine the Power Level of plastic explosives.)

The Power Level is reduced by the vehicle's **Body** or **Armor**, whichever is higher. In this case, that happens to be the Nightsky's **Body**, so the explosion does 14D damage (18 - 4 = 14).

Predictably, Ned fails to resist the damage and gets his brains splattered against a nearby wall (thus saving the Nightsky's oyabun owner the trouble of doing the job himself).

If the vehicle is packed with less than the minimum charge required to destroy it, the explosion merely damages the vehicle. If more than half but less than the full minimum is used, the blast causes Serious Damage. If less than half is used, the blast causes Moderate Damage. In either case, the explosion causes damage to passengers, cargo and bystanders.

**Bench Seats**
**Bench seats** are popular in compact vehicles or other vehicles in which space is at a premium. A single bench seat can accommodate one and a half human-sized passengers, or 225 kilograms. Two bench seats side by side can hold three passengers, or 450 kilograms.

Removing a bench seat frees up 6 **CF** and increases the **Load Rating** by 150 kilograms (the seat doesn't weigh 150 kilograms, but the **Load** increase reflects the fact that the vehicle now carries fewer passengers and thus has more power free for hauling cargo).

**Bench seats** may also be armored (see **Bucket Seats**), but such armor protects against attacks from the rear only. Each point of **Armor** costs 1,250 nuyen (during customization) or 12 **Design Points** (in addition to the cost of the seats) when designing the vehicle. Up to 2 points of **Armor** may be installed on a bench seat.

**Bench seats** are not available for motorcycles.

If an oversized metahuman attempts to sit in a standard seat, he will crush the seat and mangle its padding. During vehicle combat, that metahuman must resist 4L damage each turn. Additionally, he gains a +2 modifier when making **Resistance Tests** against collision damage (see **Colliding with Objects**, p. 52). Metahumans may use reinforced bench seats without penalty (see **Reinforced Bench Seats**, below).

**Folding Bench Seats**
**Folding bench seats** are common in vehicles such as limousines, to provide extra seating for lackeys and the like when needed, or in station wagons. Four **CF** are freed up for cargo (weighing up to 150 kilograms) when a folding bench seat is folded.

**Reinforced Bench Seats**
**Reinforced bench seats** are designed to support the weight of trolls and other large metahumans. A reinforced bench seat can hold up to 300 kilograms.

When replacing a standard bench seat with a reinforced one, the vehicle's current **Load Rating** must be able to accommodate the additional weight of the reinforced seat.

**Bucket Seats**
A **bucket seat** holds a single person in greater comfort than a standard bench seat. Removing a bucket seat frees up 6 **CF** and increases a vehicle's **Load Rating** by 100 kg (the seat doesn't weigh 100 kilograms, but the **Load** increase reflects the fact that the vehicle now carries one less 100-kilogram passenger).

**Bucket seats** may be armored to provide protection from weapons fire. Each point of armor acts as ballistic or impact armor against any rear or side attacks directed against the passenger while he is in the vehicle. Each point of armor costs 1,250 nuyen or 12 additional **Design Points**. Up to 2 points of armor may be installed.

If an oversized metahuman attempts to sit in a standard seat, he will crush the seat and mangle its padding. During vehicle combat, that metahuman must resist 4L damage each turn. Additionally, he gains a +2 modifier when making **Resistance Tests** against collision damage (see **Colliding with Objects**, p. 52). Metahumans may use reinforced bucket seats without penalty (see **Reinforced Bucket Seats**, below).

**Reinforced Bucket Seats**
**Reinforced bucket seats** are designed to support the weight of large orks, trolls and other large metahumans. A reinforced bucket seat can hold up to 250 kilograms. Sturdier seats are also available, but they cost an additional 100 nuyen for every additional 25 kilograms of support capacity.

When replacing a standard bucket seat with a reinforced one, the vehicle's current **Load Rating** must be able to accommodate the additional weight of the reinforced seat.

**Ejection Bucket Seats**
The **ejection bucket seat** is a standard or armored bucket seat fitted with a small solid-fuel rocket and rudimentary stabilization systems. Ejection-activation controls may be included on or near the seat (or elsewhere) at the time of installation. The seat includes a para-sail that deploys on ejection and brings the chair and occupant safely to the ground, assuming the occupant is securely strapped in. The cost of the seat and the **CF Consumed** include the necessary jettison-capable panels that allow the seat to be fired clear.

**Reinforced ejection bucket seats** are also available for large orks, trolls and other large metahumans. Double the appropriate costs for reinforced ejection seats.

**Existing Vehicles Adjusted for Metahumans**
All of the vehicles listed in the **Vehicle List** (p. 148) are also available in metahuman-adjusted variants, which replace all standard seats with reinforced seating. To calculate the cost of a reinforced-seat model, count the number of bench and bucket seats in the vehicle. Multiply the number of seats by 1,200 nuyen and add this amount to the cost of the vehicle. (Yes, this gives a higher cost than simply replacing the regular seats with the reinforced seats. But remember that the manufacturer is also adjusting the performance of the vehicle to compensate for the heavier-than-normal driver and passengers.)

This package deal also includes size adjustment of manual controls, if necessary.

Metahuman-adjusted vehicles may be harder to obtain, more expensive or simply unavailable in areas unfriendly to metahumans.

**Convertible Tops**
"Rag-top" conversions are available for vehicles that normally come with hard tops and do not have gull-wing or canopy access. The conversion replaces the hard-top roof with a folding canopy that can be extended or retracted on command. If a **roll bar** is not installed, double the target number for any passenger **Damage Resistance Test** following a crash. Rag-tops do not provide vehicle protection to passengers from side, rear or top attacks.

**Cranes**
A crane is a hydraulic-powered mechanical boom capable of lifting heavy loads. To use a crane, the vehicle must be stationary and immobilized with the supplied chocks. Cranes are not available for vehicles with **Body Ratings** of 0.

A crane has its own **Load Rating**, which denotes how many kilograms of weight it can lift. The maximum **Load Rating** for a crane is based on the vehicle's **Body**, as shown on the **Crane Capacity Table**. If desired, players can install cranes with **Load Ratings** lower than the maximum allowed for the vehicle.

If a vehicle uses its crane to pull or tow an object while moving (for example, a tow truck towing an automobile), the towing maximum is determined by the vehicle's or crane's **Load Rating**, whichever is lower.

For more information on lifting and towing, see **Lifting and Pulling Objects** (p. 33).

**Drone Racks**
**Drone racks** are used to launch airborne drones from moving vehicles. The rack is a hardware cradle that holds the drone, moves it into launch position and then releases it. **Drone racks** can also be used to recover launched drones while the vehicle is moving.

Launching a drone from a **drone rack** requires two separate actions, the first to activate the drone rack and the second to launch the drone. The drone is then considered to be moving at either the current speed of the vehicle or the drone's stall speed, whichever is greater. Rotorcraft drones launched from stationary vehicles launch in hover mode.

Recovering a launched drone requires a successful **Handling Test** by the driver of the recovering vehicle and a Free Action. At the same time, the drone's controller must make a **Handling Test**. If either test fails, the drone has not been recovered. If both tests fail, the drone crashes into the vehicle.

The **drone rack** also serves as an enclosed mini-hangar that protects drones stored inside it. A **drone rack** has the same **Armor Rating** as the vehicle on which it is mounted, but only one-half the vehicle's **Body** (round down.)

**External Cargo Mounts**
**External cargo mounts** include accessories such as roof racks and externally mounted side cargo-boxes on motorcycles.

**External cargo mounts** require no **CF** allocation, but when the cargo mount is loaded the vehicle's **Handling Rating** increases by 1. The maximum cargo capacity of a vehicle's external mounts is equal to the vehicle's original internal cargo capacity.

This modification may not be added during the design process.

**Floatation Packages (Aircraft)**
Any aircraft or helicopter may be fitted with floats for amphibious operations. Adding floats to an aircraft increases the aircraft's **Economy** by the initial Economy multiplied by 1.20. Additionally, the floats reduce the aircraft's **Speed** by half. And of course, an aircraft fitted with floats cannot touch down on land.

Floats also reduce the **Speed Ratings** of helicopters. To determine the reduced Speed of a float-equipped helicopter, multiply the helicopter's initial **Speed Rating** by .9 and round down. The product is the helicopter's new **Speed Rating**. Float-equipped helicopters can still touch down on land, however.

**Hovercraft Water Seals**
Normally, a hovercraft that loses power while on a body of water will sink within 30 minutes. However, a **hovercraft water seal** makes a hovercraft's chassis watertight and enables the craft to float, a useful capability if the engine fails, is deliberately turned off or destroyed while the vehicle is moving over water.

**Mechanical Arms**
Articulated mechanical arms are not as strong as cranes, but they possess superior dexterity. In fact, a mechanical arm can do the same things a metahuman arm can and then some.

Every mechanical arm has a **Strength Rating**, which is equal to the vehicle's **Body Rating** squared. (For example, an arm fitted to a vehicle with a **Body Rating 1** would have a starting **Strength** of 1, an arm on a **Body 2** vehicle would have a starting **Strength** of 4, an arm on a **Body 3** vehicle would have a starting **Strength** of 9 and so on.) A mechanical arm can lift a number of kilograms equal to its **Strength Rating** multiplied by 50.

An arm's **Strength Rating** may be increased by purchasing additional **Strength** enhancement. Note that increasing the Strength of an arm also increases its **Load reduction**, which limits the amount of **Strength** enhancement a mechanical arm can take. The **Strength Rating** of a limb can never increase beyond ten times the **Body Rating** of the vehicle to which it is attached.

Mechanical arms can sport any accessory or feature available on cyberarms except for the limb enhancements described in the **Cybertechnology** sourcebook. A limb accessory for a mechanical arm costs half as much as the standard cyberarm version of the accessory, but has the same **Availability** and **Street Index** ratings as the standard version.

**Sidecars**
Motorcycle sidecars come in three sizes: small, medium and large. The **Sidecar Table** shows the costs and benefits of adding a sidecar to a vehicle.

The cargo capacity for each sidecar does not include seating, which must be taken out of the sidecar's **CF** capacity (for example, a small sidecar can accommodate one bucket seat, but it takes up all of the sidecar's **CF**). A motorcycle's **Load Rating** does not change with the installation of a sidecar, so characters will have to be careful not to overload the sidecar with excessive weight.

A sidecar reduces the cycle's **Speed** by 15, increases its **Handling Rating** by the appropriate modifier and decreases its **Economy** by 10 percent. (To calculate the new Economy, simply multiply the initial **Economy Rating** by .9.) A sidecar has the same **Body Rating** as the vehicle on which it is mounted. Sidecar armor may be increased in accordance with the standard vehicle modification rules (p. 127).

Installing or removing a sidecar requires 15 minutes.

**Spotlights**
A spotlight projects a concentrated beam of light. It has an effective range of 600 meters, with a beam diameter of 0.5 meters at the point of origin and 5 meters at maximum range. The beam diameter increases in proportion to the range, so the diameter of the spotlight at 300 meters would be 300/600 x (0.5 + 5), or 2.75 meters.

In addition to standard white-light spotlights, spotlights are also available in medium-range infrared, which is invisible to the unaugmented human eye but illuminates areas for low-light and thermographic imaging systems. Spotlights may be controlled manually or remotely operated from inside a vehicle.

**Tires**
A number of different tire types are available. All require a standard tool kit to install. Spare tires take up a number of **CF** equal to one-half the **Body** of the vehicle, rounded down.

All vehicles are fitted with appropriate tires at the time of manufacture for no extra cost. Characters need only pay tire costs if they request special tires during vehicle design or replace or add tires as vehicle customizations.

**Standard tires** are regular, run-of-the-mill tires. For vehicles using these tires, reduce by half (round down) the effects of any suspension or **Handling** modifications. Cost = **Body** x 50¥ each.

**Performance tires** are required for use with improved suspension and drive-by-wire systems. They also negate the effects of off-road or active suspensions in off-road mode. Cost = **Body** x 75¥ each.

**Off-road tires** are required for use with off-road suspensions or active suspensions in off-road mode. With all other types of suspensions, they behave as standard tires (i.e., they negate the benefits of improved suspension and drive-by-wire improvements during on-road operation). Cost = **Body** x 125¥ each.

**Dual-Purpose tires** are designed for use with active suspensions, allowing vehicles to operate both off-road and on-road without penalty. These tires act like standard tires with regard to improved and high-speed suspensions. Assume that any vehicle with improved suspension or a drive-by-wire system is also equipped with dual-purpose tires. Cost = **Body** x 250¥ each.

**Runflat** versions of all the aforementioned tire types are available. A **runflat** tire has the equivalent protection of an armored vest (5/3). Cost = tire cost + 200¥ each.

**Winches**
**Winches** are attached to the bumpers of ground vehicles and can pull and tow heavy loads.

A winch has its own **Load Rating** / weight capacity, which determines how much weight the winch can pull, tow or lift. The maximum **Load Rating** for a winch is based on the vehicle's **Body**, as shown on the **Winch Capacity Table**. If desired, players can select winches with **Load Ratings** lower than the maximum for their vehicle's **Body Ratings**.

If a vehicle uses its winch to pull or tow an object while moving (for example, a tow truck towing an automobile), the towing maximum is determined by the vehicle's or winch's **Load Rating**, whichever is lower.

A vehicle can also use a winch to pull itself across normally impassable terrain, such as up a vertical cliff face. The vehicle must not be loaded over its **Load Rating** when doing so, however. The winch pulls the vehicle at a speed of 1 meter per turn. The vehicle cannot perform any other actions while the winch is working.

For more information on lifting and towing, see **Lifting and Pulling Objects** (p. 33).

The revised vehicle design and customization rules were designed to provide players with as much flexibility as possible when creating vehicles. This flexibility gives players enormous freedom to exercise their imaginations, but it also enables them to misuse the system. To prevent such misuse, the gamemaster has the right to approve, modify or disallow any new vehicle.

Ideally, vehicle design should be a cooperative process between the player and the gamemaster, with a little give-and-take on both sides. If a player has a really creative, solid and well thought-out idea, the gamemaster should respect the player's efforts and let him run with it. At the same time, the gamemaster also has the responsibility to keep the game balanced, entertaining and challenging—and players should respect that.

If a player creates a vehicle that threatens the balance of the game or gives an unfair advantage (either to the player character or the NPCs), the gamemaster has several options. For example, the gamemaster has the final say over the final vehicle cost, so by sufficiently raising the cost he can limit the vehicle's use in the game. Alternatively, the gamemaster can change any of the vehicle's ratings, features, design options and modifications, or even veto proposed design options and vehicle modifications. And as a last resort, the gamemaster can simply prohibit the player from introducing the vehicle into the game.

### CONVERTING EXISTING VEHICLES

The **Rigger II** sourcebook is a complete overhaul of the entire vehicle system. It changes the elementary definitions of several vehicle ratings, deletes a few old ratings and introduces several new ratings. Consequently, no simple method exists for translating the game statistics of previously published or player-designed vehicles to the new system.

The **Vehicle List** (p. 148) provides new game statistics for all vehicles published in previous FASA products. The new statistics re-create the original vehicles as faithfully as possible: they were retrofitted to account for **Design Points** and **Mark-Up Factors**, but the final vehicle prices may not precisely reflect a new vehicle built using this system. The final vehicle prices for existing vehicles are, however, balanced in the game and balanced against the prices of new vehicles built using the **Vehicle Design and Customization** system. Gamemasters may adjust these prices up or down to suit their own game, but the prices given here should be considered the official costs of these vehicles.

As far as player-designed vehicles and "home-brew" inventions are concerned, we recommend that players re-design these vehicles using the vehicle-design rules in this section. When re-designing vehicles, players should keep the following principles in mind.

First, **Body Ratings** are fixed and cannot be changed, either during vehicle design or vehicle customization. A vehicle's **Body Rating** is linked to the vehicle's weight, and the rating system uses a scale of 1 to 10 to cover vehicles ranging in size from a toaster-sized drone to a sixty-ton main battle tank. Therefore, **Body Ratings** of vehicles of the same type should never differ significantly.

Second, remember that **Design Points** are used to purchase design options and modifications during the vehicle design process. Once the character has purchased the vehicle (either during character creation or later in the adventure), additional modifications must be made as vehicle customizations and paid for with nuyen, not **Design Points**. Also, the specifications of a modification may differ depending on whether the modification is incorporated during vehicle design or installed later as a vehicle customization. These specifications are noted in the descriptions of each modification.

The final price of a vehicle is determined by multiplying the **Design Points** by the **Mark-Up Factor**. Gamemasters are free to "fudge" the **Mark-Up Factor** in either direction, in the interest of adding variety to their games and preventing their campaigns from degenerating into vehicle "powergaming."
