# FIELDS OF FIRE - Lore
## MERCENARY OPERATIONS
I am a mercenary.
> (As a point of interest, Juan Samuel Pererya posts in these parts under the handle Matador. If I'm not mistaken, he's posting these days from a Peruvian hospital (or some similar place). A few of his postings appear in the Field Pack section of this upload-which, oddly enough, seems to have been compiled backwards. The Field Pack equipment section is an older posting; you can tell by the dates. Who knows why it ended up second in the file sequence? I don't know if Matador will post comments on his own work, but it'll be more interesting if he does.) -Colonel Cobra (12:19:28/01-02-55)
> (By the way, since this is a public posting (to be echoed after the usual annotation) I expect a lot of non-mercs to be perusing these pages. A non-merc myself, I found the contents interesting stuff. I've read through it once, and log back in every so often to annotate it myself where necessary. I think this material is of value to everyone, not just mercs. Pererya says a lot in here about how we should act and behave toward each other (shadowrunners take note!), so pay attention. Professionalism shouldn't be limited to self-proclaimed professionals. It's a code we should all follow. Lord knows I'd feel safer walking the shadow-streets if we did.) -Hatchetman (03:19:50/01-04-54)

One of the dictionaries on my computer defines the term mercenary in two ways: a) One who works or acts merely for money or other reward, or b) A professional soldier serving in a foreign army solely for pay.
I cannot dispute the letter of what each says. I once asked a young relative of mine (who believed I worked in the international import/export business, an old and respected cover) what he thought the term "mercenary" meant. He told me mercenaries were people who went someplace else and killed people for money. I cannot honestly dispute his definition.
> (Yeah, no drek you can't. Wonder why?) -Smiley (21:17:17/01-04-55)
> (Shut up and read, sludge brain.) -Weasel (03:29:16/01-06-55)

I can, however, explain what the term mercenary means to me. This may take some time, so bear with me.
## WHAT IS A MERCENARY?
I am a soldier, pure and simple. I am trained in the ways of modern warfare and schooled in the theories of the ancients. I do what people who consider themselves humane believe is unnecessary in our modern world.
I use force to accomplish an end. It's a simple, age-old problem. You want something done. Someone or something stands in your way. But what you want done is important. It cannot be left undone. What do you do? What alternatives do you have? What price will you pay to achieve your goal?
> (He makes a valid point, one a lot of people tend to forget. What happens when negotiating doesn't work? We've become so afraid of war, or, more precisely, its price in blood, that we knee jerk toward negotiation and compromise. Unfortunately, talking sometimes just doesn't work, especially when someone wants something very badly. There's a remake of some old pop tune making the rounds these days, and one of its lyrics goes something like this: "I don't know no military solution that didn't end up as something worse." Sorry, chummer, whoever you were-like it or not, I can think of plenty that did what they were supposed to do.) -Conjoiner (20:51:54/01-03-55)
> (Yeah, but isn't it a good thing that we so quickly reject a military solution? Isn't prudence sometimes better? Many military solutions have failed, and with disastrous results, because the people in charge thought they understood what was going on and only succeeded in making things worse. Maybe thinking twice and trying everything else three times isn't such a bad thing.) -Findler-man (03:28:16/01-05-55)

Some people would have you believe that only two alternatives exist: peace and war. Though we can learn much from the practice of Taoism and the wisdom of the ancients, things are not always as simple as wet or dry, white or black, soft or hard, peace or war. Sometimes you have both.
That's where I come in.
A mercenary's job involves much more than simply waging war on someone else's payroll. War is pain and death and misery. War is not something humans desire. It is, however, something we must accept when there are no alternatives. If we believe strongly that something must be done, we may have to fight for it. By the same token, if we do not believe strongly, we should not fight. But we must make that decision before we begin. Once we begin, we can't turn back.
Force must be applied with intelligence. Anyone can fire a submachine gun into a crowd. Anyone can push a button and launch a missile that slaughters a hundred children. Anyone can kill. It's easy.
A mercenary knows how to kill. He also knows when not to kill. He knows that sometimes, simply being strong is enough. He knows that the threat of violence can bring about peace-time and again, history has proved this truth. He knows that one man or group of men in the right place at the right time can save hundreds from death. He also knows that sometimes, talking isn't enough. And he stands ready for that moment.
> (Yeah, he loves that moment. He sits in the dark, quivering, waiting for that moment.) -Smiley (21:19:08/01-04-55)
> (Geez, what's with you?) -Weasel (03:31:54/01-06-55)
## BEING A MERCENARY
Not everyone is cut out to be a mercenary. It takes a certain kind of individual to be a mercenary. A mercenary understands herself, her abilities, and her limitations. She knows her role in the world, what she is expected to do, and what lies outside her responsibility. She can dream, but holds no illusions about reality. Most of all, she understands the intelligent application of force.
As dangerous and horrific as it can be, she understands it as a valuable and effective tool.
She understands people. She knows how their minds work, how they think when they are calm, how they react when they are afraid. She understands what people want, from basic sustenance to decadent luxury, and she knows the lengths to which people will go to get what they want. She knows how to reason with others, how to explain her own and her opponent's position, how to listen and make others listen.
The mercenary is always prepared. She knows her equipment and her weapons. She knows what she needs and where to get it. She knows the requirements of her assignment and the equipment needed to get the job done.
> (I'll attest to that! We've stopped getting our combat gear through our local fixer, and now use one of our teammate's old merc contacts, his dealer. Takes longer, and sometimes pickups get a little complicated, but the quality of the stuff that shows up is first-rate.) -Wenton Warrior (08:27:40/01-06-55)

Above everything else, the mercenary knows her job. She's analyzed it, dissected it, and put it back together in every possible combination. She knows what's supposed to happen and what might happen, and she's prepared for those times when things don't go as expected. She is a professional.
> (Professional what? (yuck hyuck)) -Smiley (21:23:54/01-04-55)
> (Chummer, if you hadn't logged on two days ago I'd trace and burn your butt from here to Kansas City.) -Weasel (03:35:35/01-06-55)
## BASIC OPERATIONS
Many people mistakenly believe that because a mercenary works freelance, he does not live by any rules. In fact, mercenaries are professionals, and like all professionals, live by a certain set of rules. A mercenary must value and practice personal discipline, interpersonal skills, preparedness, and controlled orientation and exposure. I touched on these requirements in a general way already, but because these issues lie at the heart of being a mercenary, this next section expounds on each requirement in detail.
These abilities are the basics, the things you must know, digest, and make your own before you begin your career as a mercenary. Even seasoned professionals need to review these basics from time to time, because the years of work tend to make you forget. Never forget.
## PERSONAL DISCIPLINE
I live by a code. Most mercenaries do. A merc without a personal code is nothing more than a sociopath with no concern beyond himself. Mercenaries are not madmen.
> (Some might argue that point, but this is not the forum in which to contest it. Personally, I think there's a little something loose in the head of anyone who chooses the life of a merc-or one in the shadows, for that matter.) -Normal PEE (21:39:02/01-05-55)

The process of discovering your code, what you will and will not allow yourself to do, takes a lifetime's worth of learning. It never ends, for any of us. Before you choose the mercenary's life, you must determine your own code. Find out where you believe the lines are drawn. This knowledge is very important.
> (It is not just important. It's mandatory. If you don't establish a code for your life, you'll soon find yourself flopping compulsively from cause to cause, caring less and less about human life. God, is it important. Find your code. Live by it.) -Winter Rat (23:19:20/01-06-55)

I became comfortable with my code many years ago, but i know that I am an exception to the rule. I became a mercenary for my own reasons. Though my history shares much with that of other mercenaries, certain, singular things in my heart and mind define me. They color everything that happens to me and shape the way I see the world. Every person possesses individual, unusual perspectives and thoughts that shape his or her world view. Find yours and learn what they mean as quickly as you can. 
Because my experience may help others formulate their own codes, or at least give them something to think about, I'm writing down the broadest precepts of my personal code. I keep the specifics nailed down in my head, but those won't matter to anyone except me.
> (If Matador's specifics do matter to you, here's a tidbit-Matador is Mexican. Note that I said Mexican, not Aztlaner. That distinction is important.) -Night Hunter (02:19:14/01-08-55)

I take only jobs I believe in. Before I contract for a job, I learn all I can about the work and the situation, and not just from the client. I do my own research and learn as much of the truth as possible. Sometimes, especially with secret operations, I can't learn much. In those situations I trust my fixer. He and I have a long-established relationship; he knows me and knows the kind of jobs I won't do.
> (Basically, learn when to say NO! It's easy, really, and ultimately it earns you a lot of respect. Don't get caught on some testosterone wave and take a job because your machismo demands it. If your guts don't like it, turn it down.) -Uncle Paul (11:08:47/01-06-55)

I do not take jobs offered solely because of my ability to kill. I am not a professional killer. Though killing is often part of my profession, I cannot be hired exclusively to kill. I admit that his part of my code may wander into a gray area, because I have done wet work in the past and will probably do it again. (Wet work, for those who don't know, is assassination for hire.) But I am not a professional assassin. The wet work I've performed has always been one element of a larger operation, admittedly sometimes the principal objective of that operation. The difference between me and a professional assassin lies in the first part of my code. I take only jobs I believe in. If performing a job I believe in means people must die, I accept this. I live with it.
> (Notice the important subtext running through much of this abstract: Kill only when necessary. I prefer to forget the number of runs I've been on that were filled with gratuitous killing. I don't work with jokers like that twice. Few people do, because soon they'll have so many corps and cops after them that no one will want to hire them. Don't kill unless you have to. Non-lethal tactics work just as well as lethal ones most times, and don't create the same kind of enemies.) -Hatchetman (04:10:18/01-08-55)

I am not judge, jury, and executioner. I am not the law. The society and civilization we live in accepts some things and reviles others. I make my judgment calls based on the precepts of that society. Are the objectives of my job acceptable or even beneficial to society as a whole? Am I helping to advance some worthy cause? If not, I don't take the job, or I refuse to fulfill the objective.
I live and work by my conscience and my code. I walk away if things change. Sometimes, the truth is different from the inside. Once an operation begins, certain things become evident that could not be seen before. If this new truth changes the way I view an operation so that I would not have taken the operation if I had known those truths going in, I will walk away from that operation. I have walked away, and it has cost me money, prestige, work, and friendships. I make sure my employer understands this part of my code before I begin the operation. My attitude has affected the kind of jobs I get and given me a certain reputation. I like that. I value all human life. I value both friend and foe. I will not betray my friends or my allies for the "cause."
Yes, I sometimes need to make hard decisions, but I will not work with the knowledge that those decisions must be made as part of the operation. I especially value the life of my opposition. You'll note that I don't say "enemy." I do not assume my opponent is my enemy. My opponents believe, perhaps as strongly as I do, that they are doing something important. They have values, a code perhaps, and most important, they also have lives. I have no inherent right to take that life. Don't misunderstand me: I fully understand that killing may be required, but I will not kill needlessly. Yes, I consider injury a viable alternative to death. I would gladly injure someone, even permanently disable them, to remove that person as a threat rather than kill them. Killing may not be necessary, but it does come with the territory. Have I ever violated my code? Yes. It troubled me deeply every time. But I'm glad it disturbs me to do so. That's how I know I'm human.
> (I know Matador, and I envy him his code. Many people in our line of work wrestle with their consciences almost daily, and that constant struggle makes me wonder why some people become mercenaries. For the glory? There isn't much. For the thrill? Too many get involved this way. For the money? Become an accountant. The corps always need more accountants. Personally, the Euro-Wars left me without a place in society. Combat affected me so deeply that the scars from what I'd experienced began killing me once the war stopped. The only way I could keep my mind intact was to tear those wounds open each time they started to heal. Has it helped? Am I sane because of it? I don't know.) -Colonel Cobra (03:20:18/01-05-55)
## INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
Don't deceive yourself. You can't be a successful mercenary by "letting your gun speak for you." That cliché will get you killed. You are a professional, and you must always behave like one. As a professional soldier you must know how to communicate, how to send and receive messages. Communication takes many forms, and written and oral language represents only a minor area of true communication. Simply by stating "I am a mercenary," you are sending a message. The base level of that particular message, however, has little or nothing to do with you. What that message communicates relies almost completely on the receiving person's perception of a mercenary's role. If they believe that mercenaries are soulless killers, then they will deal with you on that basis. If they believe that a mercenary is a professional who knows his job and is prepared to do it, then your statement communicates that notion to them. Initially, it does not matter what message you intend to send. What they believe defines their interpretation of the message they receive. If they perceive something different from what you intend, you must convince them otherwise.
> (Many people live in a vacuum of understanding. They view the world through their own frame of reference, refusing to accept what other people hear or see as valid. They don't realize that much of what each of us knows (or believes we know) clouds our perceptions. Think about the many tragedies that could have been avoided if people paid attention to the messages they were sending and how others perceived those messages.) -Doc Tanner (20:14:27/01-09-55)

You can only convince people of what you really represent through skilled communication. You tell everyone you meet who and what you are in four ways: the ways you speak, write, act, and look.
Don't dismiss this as nonessential. I cannot exaggerate the importance of communication skills to a professional soldier. You must constantly be aware of how others perceive you, because their perceptions control their behavior toward you. What you actually intend means nothing in the face of what they believe of you.
### How to Speak
Speak well, speak clearly. Make sure they understand you. When on duty, make every verbal communication with your superiors a formal communication. This holds true whether your superiors are your friends or you think they are dog scum. You are a professional. Learn to speak the local language from a native. If you learn it from a chip or rely on a linguasoft, the natives will get the message that you don't care enough to learn the language properly. If you speak the local language unassisted by technology, you send the message that you are willing to spend the necessary time to learn about the local culture.
You are willing to spend the time to learn how to speak to them. That's a powerful message.
Learn how the locals speak. Do they speak loudly?
Softly? Using direct eye contact? Emulate the locals rather than mimicking them, and don't attempt to do it perfectly. You probably can't, and it's better to acknowledge the fact that you are an outsider who respects their culture than to embarrass yourself and them by performing badly. If you mess up, you appear to mock their traditions.
> (Day-to-day corporate life teaches the same lesson with regard to the Japanese megacorps. How long has the West maintained corporate relations with the Japanese? A century? How many billions of nuyen have the corps spent on research, analysis, and training? Can a gaijin bow correctly yet? Nope, yet they keep right on trying.) <<<<< -Mr. Yota-san (20:19:27/01-10-55)

Do not speak to the locals as if they are subordinates. These people live where you work. You are their guest, even if you work for their government. Your profession means that people will listen very carefully to what you say to find the message they expect. Because you are a mercenary, others will believe you deceptive, hiding things behind doublespeak. Be clear. Be concise. Allow no room for doubt or misunderstanding.
### How to Write
Write clearly and concisely. Make sure they understand you. To tell the truth, I do little writing in the field. Between jobs, however, I can easily fill my time with after-action reports, supply and inventory requests, mission-planning documents, and so on. And though I may not actually write the first draft (I prefer speech-recognition dictation into my pocket secretary) I always proof the final document to make sure that it is complete and looks professional, and that it doesn't sound like I wrote it off the-cuff. Even the most well-structured, formal speech reads poorly when written unless you edit it. Learn to write the local language. In this case, chip based literacy is usually good enough because written language tends to be more formal. Languages based on pictographic character sets constitute an exception to this rule. Because even the most advanced linguasoft often provides somewhat rough pictograph depiction, have a trustworthy native proficient in the written language check the lettering. Everyone who reads your communications will attempt to read between the lines, and will look long and hard to find whatever they think you are not telling them. Your only useful response is to leave nothing to interpretation. Be clear. Be concise.
Avoid written communication whenever possible.
Even my mind boggles at the number of times I've heard that operational security was compromised because someone wrote down sensitive information. If you must keep notes or, God forbid, a diary (I can think of few actions more idiotic for a merc), write in a personal symbolic code. Don't use a cipher-ciphers can be easily broken. A code in which a single symbol sub-references an entire concept and augments the following symbols is much harder to break. Your opponent will need you to translate such a code-and don't be naive; they'll make you do it.
### How to Act
The way you act may be your most important method of communication. I have known many talented men and women who think that holding a position of power or carrying a gun gives them the right to act like children. In fact, just the opposite is true.
> (Working the streets proves the ugly truth of what Matador says here. I've been at countless meets where the participants were copping the juvenile "wiz 'tude" one-upmanship program. If I have to watch one more street sam clean his blades during a negotiation, I'll vomit. What's the point, other than pure narcissism? (And I apologize to all you street sams who will have to look that word up.)) -Hatchetman (04:24:28/01-06-55)
> (Hey Hatchet, I thought you were a street sam?) -Global Warmer (23:29:18/01-06-55)
> (I am. Trust me-I know all about them.) -Hatchetman (20:10:16/01-08-55)

The cliche is old but true: with power comes responsibility. I've said it at least a dozen times already: you are a professional. You must act like a professional at all times. How you act reflects on you, your allies, and others in your profession.
Your actions send the most powerful messages about who and what you are. Even a person who believes you a soulless killer may change her mind over time when presented with behavior that refutes that belief. I cannot create a comprehensive list of acceptable and unacceptable actions, but I can offer some guidelines based on my own experience. Fully exploring each of the following guidelines could require an entire book per guideline, but until I write those books, I can only hope that the short explanations and examples will spark a little understanding.
* Avoid non-professional relationships while on the job. This short sentence covers a great many things. Don't become friends with your client-keep that relationship clearly defined. Develop a trusting, familiar, business relationship with your team members or allies, but don't befriend them. (Save that for downtime. You can act buddy-buddy, but do not develop an emotional attachment during the operation. What bonds people under stress is different from what bonds people during the calm. I find that friendships developed during the calm are far stronger.) Avoid sexual relationships of any kind; they only increase your vulnerability to blackmail or manipulation. Sexual relationships can also lead to emotional bonds that could jeopardize the operation.
> (I don't know about this one. Ya see, Matador has spent a lot of time isolating himself from emotional associations that could harm him. Despite this, he has an amazing ability to sympathize and empathize with all types of people. I've seen it happen. What he does, though, is abstracts it. He sympathizes with the situation. He empathizes with the plight. He sees the problem as it affects many people, not just one person. One person could hurt him.) -Winter Rat (19:02:17/01-09-55)
* Play it straight. Because you are ultimately only a hired hand, your best option is to shoot straight. For as long as the operation lasts, your only loyalty is to your client. This stays true unless you learn something you didn't know when you began the operation that violates your personal code. Even in that situation, play it straight. Protect yourself, but lay your cards on the table.
> (Are you fraggers paying attention? THIS IS IMPORTANT ON THE STREETS. You know the saying, "It ain't a shadowrun unless your Johnson has screwed you twice?" You know why that's true? 'Cause the Johnsons think shadowrunners are scum, and rightly so. Merc employers don't have this attitude, and neither do people who hire other kinds of freelancers. Why does this attitude stick to shadowrunners? 'Cause these people are fools! They heap crap on the Johnson. They act barely professional. They don't make plans, or even think things through. They create nearly as much trouble on the run as the run was supposed to solve, and they have no respect for each other or the people paying them. They aren't professionals in any sense of the word. They're thugs.) -Hatchetman (20:17:18/01-08-55)
> (Gee, Hatchet, having a quality control problem?) -\'Shroom (09:20:19/01-10-55)
> (Fraggin' right I am, and I'm full-throttle tired of it. I kicked the drek out of a decker two days ago because he skimmed a corporate datastore we were explicitly told not to skim. What's his excuse? "They're a corp; who's gonna know?“ How about me? How about him? How about our employer, since they know exactly when we were in there? How about the corp we ran against that just might be willing to absorb the damage? If the decker skimmed something damn valuable and the corp finds out, who'll be twisting in the wind then?) -Hatchetman (18:28:20/01-11-55)
> (Careful, Hatchetman. We know you're blowing off steam, but you don't want to be slammin' deckers 'round these parts.) -Findler-man (19:19:18/01-12-55)
* Play it smart. Know when to say no. Don't allow yourself to be drawn into positions detrimental to your health or security just because it seems to be part of the game. Don't allow yourself to be goaded into acting stupidly. Your opposition (and perhaps someone on your own side) is waiting for you to make a mistake. Stay in control. Don't allow yourself to be manipulated or jerked around.
* Be a professional. Everything I talk about in this book, everything, should become an integral, reflexive part of your life. None of the advice written here can be ignored even for a moment. Your life may depend on it. More than once I've been in a bad situation, on the losing side, but I walked away in one piece because I maintained my professionalism. People respect that, even if they don't respect what you do. I'll discuss another big part of this particular point later on: odds are, you'll be facing other professionals, other mercs. Respect runs both ways.
> (True, true, especially in the merc's field of operations. I've watched a merc field commander calmly eating lunch with his captured merc adversary with a complete lack of special security precautions or even a hint of worry, simply because they're both merc. Boggled my mind at first, but then I realized it's all part of this code thing. Warfare is hell, and they're the ones who do it for the ones who won't. All this code stuff is just one way of keeping themselves sane.) -Merc-On-Training Wheels (20:42:59/01-09-55)
### How to Dress
Don't stop reading now. You may think that discussing a merc's outfit sounds pretty dumb, but how you dress sends a specific message. People base their responses to you on what they think they know (preconceptions) and what they experience (perceptions). If I see a merc on dress duty looking rumpled, I question his commitment. If I see an off-duty merc out carousing and looking like gutter filth, I question his discretion. If I see a merc walk into the local watering-hole-cum-oppositionhangout in full-dress khakis, I question his sanity.
> (Oh, yeah. Remember that street sam I mentioned before who was cleaning his blades while we negotiated with a Johnson? Did I mention he had the top of his head shaved, and what little hair remained was down to his shoulder blades and bone white? Did I also mention that he had tattooed on his bald head the words BITE MY SNAKE? During the whole meeting, I could see the Johnson looking this guy over and wondering just what kind of people he was hiring.) -Hatchetman (20:29:09/01-08-55)
> (Does he actually have a snake?) -\'Shroom (09:25:09/01-10-55)
> (Yeah, a red-and-brown anaconda named Freddi.) -Hatchetman (18:34:58/01-11-55)

In general, ask yourself how another person would react listening to you, conversing with you, or just watching you. Does everything about you send the message that you are smart, alert, serious, skilled, perhaps dangerous, and definitely a professional? When you send that message, you'll be surprised by how much easier your job gets.
### PREPAREDNESS
Never take a job blind. Before you agree to the terms of a contract, do your own research, learn everything you can. Check with your contacts. Listen to the people you trust. Scan the media, but pay attention to who is saying what. Everyone, everyone, speaks from a bias or private agenda of some sort. If you recognize that bias or agenda, you can use it to your advantage.
> (Yeah-if the government-run radio station isn't shouting the news about how well its troops are doing in the mountains hunting down the rebels. . . ) -Media Watcher II (21:58:09/01-11-55)

Take nothing for granted. As part of the contract, your client may offer to provide you with everything you need. Thank him graciously, but let him know in the most professional way possible that you prefer to make all arrangements yourself. If he is a professional, he'll understand. Learn everything you can about your target zone, your area of operations. Use maps, pictures, trideo, firsthand accounts, everything available. Absorb it, file it, database it: you'll need it. Research other operations performed in the area. Why did they succeed or fail? What were their strengths and weaknesses?
> (Personally, I know I'm in trouble when the team I'm leading has a planning meeting and the response to my suggestion that we track down and debrief other runners who've pulled a run against our target is a table full of vapid stares. Then some wit says: "We can do that?") -Hatchetman (04:20:18/01-12-55)

Consider the "why" as well as the "where." Never enter a situation ignorant of local politics. That's the fastest way to get yourself dead. Why is your employer mounting this operation? What short- and long-term results does he expect? Who profits from a successful operation? Who gets hurt? Analyze all the players involved, and learn their strengths and weaknesses. Study a breakdown of your timetable. You can often determine important information from the time that things occur. For example, does your employer expect you to wrap up the operation before spring? Why? Keep a careful eye on weather and climate projections. It's an amateur's mistake to be caught flat-footed by the weather, but it's amazingly easy to overlook that factor. Finally, plan every step of the operation in detail.
Consider what you need in terms of manpower, equipment, and transportation. Arrange as many of these elements as possible yourself. Rely on your own contacts and resources in order to reduce the chance of "unexpected exposure." Again, if your client is a professional, he'll understand your methods. If forced to work with local resources, inspect those resources personally as early in the operation as possible. Don't trust your life to other people's skill with machinery or inventory. Trust only your own abilities.
Much of this advice assumes that you are in a position of authority. Even if you are not, learn these lessons well. If you take this advice to heart, you can more easily educate yourself about the wasp's nest you may land in.
Preparation is the best defense against any situation.
### ORIENTATION AND EXPOSURE
Control your orientation and exposure by making your own travel arrangements. Simple, but important. Naturally, you need to inform your client of when and where you will meet, but you need to establish certain responsibilities early in the relationship. The employer hires you to perform a specific function; in order to effectively perform all roles appropriate to that function, you must control your own security as much as possible. Because self-sufficiency is part of a merc's professionalism, your client should understand. Thank him graciously and use your own travel agent.
Your security work really begins when you reach your area of operations. Be aware of everything around you, all the time. Regardless of your location or your assignment, you were hired to do something that poses a threat to someone. Smart opponents will try to derail your operation before it begins. In the field you are always vulnerable, and you must devote constant effort to minimizing your exposure.

In merc terms, exposure refers to your vulnerability, both personally and in terms of the operation. Security is paramount. You must keep your operation secure at all times, beginning long before you reach the operational zone.
Never advertise your presence. When you reconnoiter your operational area to gather information, never reveal your identity or purpose. Though sometimes displays are important, even a primary goal, most times you need to have the lowest possible profile. Your team members should rely on each other and no one else. You serve as each other's safety net. Never forget that fact.
Discuss your operation only with those people directly cleared by your client. Even if you suspect, by virtue of chain of command or relationship, that a person knows the details of your operation, keep your own counsel.
Make every effort to avoid discussing the operation outside of a secure site. Because those who use electronic and magical eavesdropping techniques have reached new heights of subtlety and sophistication, you are automatically vulnerable anywhere outside your secure zone.
Create a secure zone. Your client may provide one for you as part of your contract, but you must take steps to ensure that it truly is secure. Supplement existing physical, electronic, and magical security with your own.
Again, if your client is a professional, he'll understand the importance of this step to prevent problems and unwanted situations down the line. Maintain weapon security. Operatives needlessly jeopardize countless operations by failing to maintain weapon security. Transport your weapons secretly and securely. Don't risk exposure by allowing a local to spot a concealed weapon. If you need to carry one for personal safety, be smart and discreet. Don't display your weapon, and don't use it as a badge of honor-it's not. It's a weapon. It kills people. Never forget what it is and why you carry it.
Once you are secure in your zone of operation, update your research. Use local resources to see if anything has changed since your initial research. For example, always check the terrain. Never assume that your map is accurate. Things change quickly in this day and age. Conduct reconnaissance, review your existing intelligence, update your plans, modify your procedures. Stay on top of the situation. You are in the zone; what was once paperwork and projections is now real. Your life is on the line.
> (Many mercs (and others) forget that situations are dynamic. Engrossed in their own plans, they forget that the opposition can and does react to events by taking action. The situation will change. The operative must forecast the change and move before it.) -Jade Horseman (17:25:06/11-12-55)
## TYPES OF WORK
Mercs perform three main types of work: corp work, government work, and independent (indi) work. All merc operations share common elements, but significant differences distinguish these three types of work. The following descriptions provide an overview of common mercenary working conditions.
### Corporate Work
Corporate work has become the mercenary's most reliable source of potential income, though available government work appears to be on an upswing, possibly in response to corp work. Corps most often hire mercs to supplement existing corp forces, either security or military. The most common assignment is simple site security, protecting a large or small facility. The area of operation is usually an unstable region that makes the corp nervous about the safety of its installation. Corps rarely create site-security assignments in a country or a major urban center administered by a stable government, preferring to devote their security resources to areas of unstable government or intense corporate competition.
Corporate work usually places mercs within the corporation's chain of command, where they must follow orders rather than giving them. Corporations often require their hired soldiers to do dirty work. If such work violates your personal code, stay away from corp assignments.
> (I've done a lot of these ops. You could say it's my forte. (I might say it too if I knew what the word meant.) Usually, the corp is expecting trouble, and so initially deploys you to some off-site location. They keep you there in a state of high readiness, and then sneak you onsite. If the opposition isn't paying attention (and they're usually too busy getting their own operation in motion to discover yours), they're caught by surprise. It works more often than you'd guess. Personally, I'd have laid bets that the opposition would be watching the site morning, noon, and night in every situation.) -Leaguer (12:09:28/01-13-55)
> (You'd be amazed.) -Hatchetman (21:29:17/01-16-55) 

Corps rarely use mercs for internal security. Most often, mercenaries perform outside security at sites far removed from principal corporate enclaves.
Mercs supplementing corporate military forces usually work in hot spots. The corps don't hire mercs unless they expect trouble, and serious trouble only crops up in unstable regions. To the best of my knowledge, however, the corps don't recruit mercs for Desert Wars. If they do it at all, they do it quietly and hope the opposing corps and the networks don't find out.
Corps sometimes hire mercs for "face-offs," when two or more corps settle their differences by force of arms.
This type of assignment sometimes takes the form of nonlethal, tag-gun combat, but sometimes it's high-pay hazard/lethal work.
> (Corporate military actions offer no joy. Corp forces are too well equipped. You can't protect yourself against half these weapons, and protection against the other half relies on some piece of barely substantial microtronic hardware. Really builds the old confidence, let me tell you.) -Worm Heart (22:39:27/01-14-55)
### Government and Related Work
Mercs find government work easy to come by, and this work often provides long-term contracts.
Governments, especially those of less prosperous and less stable nations, like to use mercs because mercenaries provide and manage their own assets.
Most contracts include a replacement or reimbursement clause, which most governments find a more efficient and economical alternative than owning and maintaining the equipment themselves.
> (This is certainly the case for sophisticated electronics and such. For example, most developing countries contract at least half their air assets, usually more than half. Many also contract for radar and surveillance assets, as well as defensive surface-to-air systems and the like. Much more economical, at least until the systems need repair. And even then, most combat units assume partial liability for damage or loss.) -Sten (21:10:14/01-11-55)

Government merc work tends to be high-mortality, however, because it relies heavily on garrison and area control duty in unstable regions, suppressing rebellions, and countering guerrilla warfare. Mercs performing government work must deal with high exposure: you move often and quickly, you rarely have time to secure a location, and the locals may act against you. Because these jobs offer the highest pay scale, that single advantage regularly outweighs the disadvantages. You takes the money and takes your chances.
Mercs may also receive offers of anti-government work, which pits them against mercs doing government work. Anti-government jobs tend to offer low pay and many dangers, but these types of assignments attract the altruistic mercs who can still believe in a cause. Though I have stated that I only take jobs I believe in, altruism is not part of my personal code. Altruism can blind you. A merc needs a pragmatic intellect to out-argue his emotions. If yours does not, I wish you well.
### Indi Work
All the operations I've described so far offer opportunities to all-merc teams through established channels. A mercenary can also find work through independent channels. In plain English, I'm talking about so-called "shadowrunning" opportunities.
> (Yeah, all-merc teams-you know, buncha guys dressed like leaves sitting around in the woods coppin' a 'tude.) -Wag (09:20:18/01-14-55)

A shadowrun puts a merc into a familiar yet different environment. In this kind of job, you become part of a multi-function team created to achieve some short-term goal. The task will require you to use all your skills in heavy exposure. You enter the operation as an individual rather than as part of an established team, though you may ultimately negotiate the terms of your contract as an individual or as part of the temporary group.
For nearly every shadowrun, you will have the best tactical skills in the group. You are there to offer the benefits of those skills. Everyone in the group has a niche, a specific role to play. Demand and maintain control of your area of expertise.
> (Hey, I always thought we hired the merc because he had the light machine gun?) -Vambrace (21:29:14/01-15-55)
> (Shhhh, don't let him hear you ... ) -Wedge (21:39:09/01-16-55)

One word of warning: indi employers (clients in the "shadowrunning" end of the business) generally hold poor opinions of shadowrunners. Why? Because shadowrunners rarely act like professionals, in our sense of the term. They have no personal discipline, no code, no sense of honor or trust, and no discretion. If you work as part of a "shadowrunning" team, it becomes more important than ever that you remain alert, smart, and professional. Someone has to.
> (See! What did I tell you!) -Hatchetman (17:09:28/01-13-55)
> (So? You told us you'd read through the file once before posting.) -Vulture Vic (03:41:51/01-14-55)
## TYPES OF OPERATIONS
Everything you've read so far has explained what a mercenary should know about himself, his operation, and his opposition. This next section describes the standard types of merc operations. Each type involves unique peculiarities and concerns, and each could form the basis of an entire book. The best I can do with my limited space is to provide some food for thought. In my opinion, the Desert Wars represent an insult to everything I hold true about my profession and cannot be included in a discussion of war in any sense.
> (Go Guards!) -Toiler (20:18:27/01-12-55)
> (Honestly, do you have any idea how many Desert War participants use some variation of the name "Guards" ?! ) -Houda (14:17:16/01-14-55)
### OPEN WARFARE
The flat-out fight commonly seen in war trids and other such forms of entertainment represents the least common assignment a mercenary is likely to pick up these days, simply because no one is currently fighting the kind of wars in which standard armies clash with each other. That kind of war just doesn't happen any more. Occasional skirmishes take place between company-size units (100 men), but these rarely expand beyond border clashes or brushfire wars that flare up quickly and die just as quickly. The days of large-scale military clashes are past. Modern-day conflicts tend to take place between warlords, provinces, and relatively small forces. The Euro-Wars marked the end of true "warfare" in the classical sense.
> (What about the secession of Tir Tairngire from NAN? The way I read it certainly sounded like warfare in the sense he's talking about.) -Loodles (13:27:45/01-14-55)
> (Not the secession itself, but perhaps the Battle of Redding. That incident, of course, resulted from Tir forces entering northern California and engaging dugin California National Guard units near Redding. Official versions of that engagement state that the Tir entered California with the equivalent of an armored division. That number might be exaggerated a bit, but no records try to dispute that the Tir mounted an extensive force. The short duration of the engagement makes it one of Matador's brushfire wars rather than open warfare. I should also point out that the Euro-Wars were still in progress when this skirmish played out, which further reinforces Matador's statement.) -Colonel Cobra (11:10:15/11-15-55)

Will we see open warfare anytime soon? Not likely. If any such action does occur, ten to one it will involve Aztlan and the Confederated American States, a couple of the Russian satellites, or a few of the mid-African regimes.
Multitudes of books explain in mind-numbing detail how to fight a modern war. I see no point in retreading them here. If you have any interest in this field, you already know these books. I strongly recommend that you restrict your reading list to works published in this century and earlier by the following strategists: Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Napoleon, Rommel, and Dunnigan. These works can provide insights that the current generation of modern electronic battlefield mavens could never hope to understand. No matter how expensive the gadgets, the basics remain the same.
### GUERRILLA WARFARE
Guerrilla warfare currently best represents the realities of modern war. Small force versus large force. Rebel versus oppressor. Minority versus majority. Mercs usually find work on the side of the "majority," except in cases of externally financed insurrection, because the larger force usually has more resources. The smaller opposition, or the minority, usually lacks training but makes up for it in dedication and inspiration. Because they believe they have "right" on their side, the minority opponent is always dangerous.
I commented earlier in this book that anyone can fire a submachine gun into a crowd. The minority force represents the anyones. The farmers, the merchants, the men, the women, and even the children believe in their cause and will die for it. They might take you with them, if you're not careful.
Whether you believe in the side you're on is between you and your conscience. But it is important to realize that in such a conflict, both sides may be right. Always remember that conflicts rarely arise from simple issues. If people feel strongly enough to fight, the issue is important to them. Never dismiss your opponent's beliefs, because those beliefs are as valid as yours.
Guerrilla warfare is difficult. You fight an opponent who knows the terrain far better than you do, a motivated opponent who doesn't want you there. In guerrilla warfare, anything goes. Such fighting is never a gentlemen's war.
No matter what happens, no matter what they do, no matter how hard they push, you must never stoop to the opposition's level. Adhere to your rules of engagement. Abide by the original Geneva Conventions and the 2042 Munich Amendments. Fight honorably. Let them worry about sleeping at night.
> (Easy for you to say. People who hurt my people pay. That's my code.) -Stoneface Jackson (23:20:07/01-14-55)
> (Actually, it probably wasn't easy for him to say.) -Winter Rat (04:56:35/01-15-55)

Opponents in guerrilla warfare constantly try to force the other side to make mistakes, especially to harm civilians. If you feel any doubt about a civilian's guilt, err on the side of mercy. Do not attack a target that might include innocents. This stand gets tough, because the opposition tends to hide among the civilian population and dare you to strike. Don't take the dare; instead, make your own opportunities for battle. Be proactive in your stance and tactics. Force your opponents into the open. Force them into action by targeting the opposition leaders.
I can see your scowls already. You think that what I'm suggesting violates my code, the part that objects to assassination. Well, what of it?
Quite simply, I do not view a leader who chooses to hide his forces among the innocent as worth my compassion. He hides his soldiers among the local population assuming that his opponent will come after them and civilians will die. If such a leader really cared for his people, he would do everything in his power to protect them. Any other attitude demonstrates the workings of an evil mind. I suffer no compunction about assassinating such soulless men.
Assassinations and guerrilla warfare in general become more difficult to conduct against a truly partisan opponent, when your opponent is the civilian. History shows us that all conflicts fought against motivated civilians result in long, bloody struggles. Any time I see a conflict against civilians shaping up, I walk. No military solution exists in such situations, short of unrestricted warfare and genocide, and I will not participate in that kind of warfare.
> (You moral snob. That's right, pick and choose your fights. Only get involved in the clean fights, lest we dirty our khakis. Your pretentiousness and hypocrisy make me sick.) -Mother Maker (02:10:28/01-15-55)
> (Don't lose it on your keyboard. Half-digested soyfood and bile is a bear to clean out from between the keys.) -Mugger Hugger (10:28:27/01-16-55)
### DISPLAYS
Displays provide a show of power to potential opposition. Your employers assume that your capable-looking presence at a location or function will deter any possible trouble. I believe that most displays fall into one of two categories: dress displays and field displays. Dress displays are like Halloween. You dress up and play soldier. Your employer asks you to act as a "military advisor" for the evening at some military or quasi-military function that his adversaries will also attend. You talk a good game and convince your client's enemies that he, you, and "hundreds" like you mean business. An employer might also ask you to appear in force and parade around. Some mercs love this kind of service, others hate it. If I can save a dozen lives by putting on my dress braids, it's a worthwhile effort. Other times, the same situation makes me feel like a puppet.
In a field display, a merc goes out in the field and gets noticed. Air-based mercenary units (chopper or fighter mercs) like this type of assignment especially well because they get paid simply for doing flybys and buzzing the crowd.
Unfortunately, a field display may quickly and unexpectedly become a skirmish. The warlord you've been hired to impress may decide to start shooting. If you take on a field display, include response and defense clauses in your contract, and a provision to re-negotiate if the situation changes. Always be ready to respond to a dynamic situation.
### BUG HUNTS/"THE BIG GAME"
I include this employment opportunity simply because it has become a lucrative field for the single operator. This type of "assignment" places mercs as assistants to professional and not-so-professional hunters on animal-hunting excursions. You provide tactical advice and skilled, heavy weapon back-up should the client (usually a corp exec) fail to "bag the big one" before the "big one" tries to bag him.
Another phenomenon that attracts many mercs is "The Big Game," simsense producer Brilliant Genesis' game show/contest/ratings grabber. As you might expect, in this production famous (and not-so-famous) big-game hunters and mercs hunt big game, in this case defined as paranormal creatures. The show awards points for bagging different kinds of critters (no sentients accepted), with the scale sliding higher or lower depending on how dangerous the creature is and the weapons used to kill it. For example, killing a creature using an assault cannon when an assault rifle would have sufficed is worth fewer points, and using your fists when a rocket launcher is the standard weapon of choice is worth more.
Strange stuff. I don't endorse it or dismiss it, merely relate it.
> (Bagged me a pair of banshees (the elfie/howling kind). That'll knock my points way up there!) -Henry Hunter (21:08:29/11-14-55)
### SECURITY
Security work can be fairly straightforward or may offer unpleasant complications. Because you work under a corporate overseer, the corp decides on tactics and procedures. How well the operation comes off depends on the competence of the corporate coordinator.
Though this subject deserves a full-length treatment, suffice it to say that corporate security work can be one of the safest types of assignments because inter-corporate conflicts rarely involve out-and-out destruction of assets. A merc working security might get hurt, but if your opponent is playing by the same rules, he's not shooting to kill.
### PERSONAL SERVICE
Mercs who take personal service work usually serve several loosely defined functions; bodyguard, advisor, and dress display. A merc hired to perform personal service may become the client's confidant, co-conspirator, protection, threat display, and potential scapegoat. This difficult job tends to place you at the center of the maelstrom. You stand at the heart of a situation, at the focal point of all the machinations and passions, and closest to the truth. This perspective allows you to quickly determine the things that may not be as they seemed, and allows you to walk away early if necessary.
A merc can pick up this kind of work from a client living in fear who needs a protective presence to reassure him so that he can meet each new day. These people often have a very good reason to be afraid. Once you determine that reason, you must decide whether or not you want to continue working for this individual. Your decision marks who you are and what kind of work you will accept. Make your decisions carefully.
As you establish a reputation based on these decisions, you may develop long-lasting relationships with people who are or become important. In these cases, you may assume that you know the truth going in, or at least the truth as understood by the client. These leaders may come to rely on you to occasionally lend your expertise in more than one situation.
> (But be careful. Petty dictators find it easy to assign blame for failures to others. And you may be one of your client's few advisors that isn't a blood relative.) -Jooom (24:06:42/01-16-55)
As you gain experience and further your reputation, you may receive the opportunity to ascend almost to the top of the merc ladder and serve as an advisor.
### ADVISORS
The most favorable position a merc can accept is that of an advisor. Your employers bring you in as a consulting expert in the military field, and so respect your opinion and listen to your advice. If your reports and their desires coincide, they may place you in a position of great power from which you command troops and recruit others farther down the professional mercenary ladder. > (You make arrangements for the client, essentially becoming his fixer by using your fixer/dealer to get what's needed. A nice position to be in.) -Sten (18:28:14/01-16-55)
The lure of such power and influence may tempt you to tell your client what he or she wants to hear, regardless of the truth of the situation. By doing so, you virtually guarantee yourself continued employment.
Don't do it.
Always play it straight. If your research and expertise tells you one thing, don't tell the client something different. Give him the hard news. He may not thank you for it, but unless you are working in some dark corner of the planet devoid of all trappings of civilization, the days of killing the messenger are long gone. You might lose your job because you told him something he didn't want to hear, but when the drek hits the turbofan later down the road, someone might remember your evaluation and warning. Next time, they just might listen. And if that client won't, someone else may.
Most advisors receive excellent pay, topnotch support and accommodations, and mind-blowing perks. Don't allow yourself to be seduced. It's easy to fall victim to the luxury and forget why you are there, but remember that other people will pay most dearly for your mistakes. If the policies you recommend fail, you might lose your job, but the dog soldiers in the field will pay the ultimate price.
### SPECIAL OPERATIONS
Special ops, the black stuff, are performed by small units for high pay under very dangerous conditions. Killer work (so to speak) if you can get it, and the best of the best often do. Corps, governments, and many independent outfits run special ops, and mercs reap the benefits. It's difficult to know how many special ops are being run these days, because pros rarely talk about their work. There's no profit in bragging. The people who need to know what you've done in order to recommend you for another job always find out. You don't have to tell them.
> (Braggers tend to be floaters.) -Sanction (08:02:30/01-17-55)

Special ops covers an almost limitless range of assignments. You name it, and someone's probably been paid to do it. Extractions, kidnappings, hit-and-runs, search-anddestroys, anti-asset raids, harassment raids, infiltration and sabotage, commando work-all these and more fall under special operations.
Today, most special ops fall under the unfortunate heading of shadowrunning. If you want that work, you've got to work the streets. Some mercs refuse these offers, but most consider the work too lucrative to pass up.
Mercs will find, however, that their expertise is underappreciated in the shadowrunning market. Runners universally consider the merc nothing more than the guy with the big gun. You've got to teach them otherwise. Show them why they need a true professional in their midst. 
> (I always insist on a professional in our midst, especially after a good fight. A professional masseuse, that is.) -Durango Jack (22:32:27/01-16-55)
> (You are a toad.) -Sheila Sunrise (08:20:16/01-18-55)
## ORGANIZATIONS
The number of mercenary organizations has risen in the last twenty-odd years. Germany's MET 2000 group and associated assets represent the top tier. They sign mercs like you and me to long-term contracts, train them into units, then assign the units to contracts with clients.
It's a sweet deal for a merc. You cut through all the planning and asset-managing to the job at hand and still get well paid. Not bad, eh?
The down side of belonging to a merc organization like MET 2000 is that such organizations make it extremely difficult to leave their ranks. You are working on the company's terms, living with a corporate rather than a personal code, and can no longer walk away if the situation changes for the worse. You are not in control-you are a company man. MET 2000 does not allow its employees to bail out of a contract, and the organization has an arm long enough to reach those who do.
> (Matador, you goronit, you hate MET 2000 because we skinned your hide last year. Admit it!) -MET 2000 Observer (04:20:19/01-13-55)
> (If you believe that's what happened, you're even more of a corporate toad than I thought.) -Matador (13:51:10/01-14-55)

Not every merc shares my point of view on this subject. In fact, a few thousand employees of MET 2000 would probably disagree with me. (By the way, don't blindly accept any published MET 2000 membership numbers. I have it on good authority that those numbers are grossly inflated.) I respect the choice of those who disagree with me. And for others who might find such indentured servitude desirable, I provide a short list of the better-known and financially respected international mercenary companies. Friends of mine have worked for these companies with what they consider desirable results.

## THE LEAGUE
The League is a phenomenon that I can only describe as the international brotherhood of mercenaries. No formal organization, no meeting place, no dues, and no newsletter for the League exist. In fact, nothing exists to identify this group as a group. Yet all mercenaries are members of the League simply by virtue of their profession as soldiers of fortune.
All members of the League should treat each other with respect and fairness, as long as they deserve it. A fool who jeopardizes himself and others through idiotic posturing and ill-considered actions has lost his place in the brotherhood, and deserves only contempt.
The tradition of fair treatment especially applies to your opponent. Your opposite number took a job with the other side for the same reason you agreed to work for your side. Don't treat opposing mercenaries unfairly just because the conflict becomes ugly. Remember such simple niceties as respect and consideration, and others will show those qualities toward you.
> (Honestly, the drek these mercs dream up to keep themselves off the emotional hook. "I'm in the League so I don't have to suffer the incarceration and torture being inflicted on the regular troops I served with. Pass the tea please, will you?" Makes me vomit.) -Mother Maker (02:18:32/01-15-55)
## MAGICAL INTEGRATION
Magic is so prevalent these days that I don't bother to make a distinction between standard and "mystical" assets. My attitude, however, remains unique. Corporations, especially, foolishly insist on grouping paranatural assets together and thinking of them as separate from their security or military assets. Mercenaries use magic in every situation where it seems appropriate, but mostly to accomplish tasks as efficiently as possible. Magic is ideal for surveillance and recon work because it enables you to pick up a lot of information at low risk and low exposure. Magic also offers many advantages in anti-espionage work, securing your physical site, and protecting your own assets.
Magic has very little offensive value, simply because too few mages are in the field to wage effective magical warfare. Special ops regularly use mages to great effect, but magic offers few advantages to other operations. Employers sometimes attach a magician to a field ops unit, but only if the field unit has a specific objective that can be achieved most efficiently using magic. I personally know of only one or two units that permanently include a magician. 
> (Again, what about the Tir secession from NAN? Seems like lots of combat magic went down there!) -Loodles (13:39:40/01-14-55)
> (Read the battle reports again, Loodles. My read is that the Tir used invisibility to conceal their forces. It was 2036; if the CNC weren't concerned enough about such possibilities to guard against them, then they got what was coming to them. On the other hand, I suspect that all the tales of combat magic from those battles were somewhat exaggerated.) -Colonel Cobra (11:46:04/11-15-55)

When a magician takes part in an operation, he should be deployed as a special weapons team and sent where needed. Currently, magicians primarily fill recon and defensive roles. I suspect those roles will someday change, but most likely not until long after I leave the business.
## HOT SPOTS
I've covered the why and how and who of being a mercenary. The following list tells you where. The world situation is too volatile for any list to be comprehensive, but the places described below represent the current government/anti-government hot spots. For any other kind of work, buy an atlas and mark all the megacities. Be sure to say hello if you see me out there.
### AZTLAN
Today, right now, Aztlan offers one of the biggest markets for anti-government work in the merc biz. The rebel forces enjoy generous financial backing, so Aztlan work tends to pay well.
The Azzies are a brutal people and highly skilled at war. They pride themselves on self-sufficiency, which means they don't care for mercenaries and so treat them poorly. Because the Aztlan problem is effectively a civil war with external backers, both sides can draw from a large pool of guerrilla warriors, but these enthusiastic soldiers lack training. Mercs act as trained leaders and advisors, making ripe targets for the opposition.
### FAR EAST
Southeast Asia remains a mess. Since the Awakening, virtually all political borders have disappeared. Only Korea maintains any semblance of cohesion, and even that nation seems fragile these days. Warlords dominate, and mercs abound. The Far East is a dangerous, changing environment controlled by leaders with no morals and few concerns beyond their petty dictatorships. The pay is good, but the risks are high.
### AUSTRALIA
A decent amount of merc work exists in Australia, mainly protecting supply caravans and enclaves against local and preternatural forces. The pay is good, but the wildness of the region, especially the rampant magic, is not for the faint of heart.
### AFRICA
Unfortunately, present-day Africa is a mecca for merc work. Small nation-states or city-states and their warlords employ countless mercs to sort out their internal upheavals. As in Southeast Asia, the region brims over with chaos and danger. But if you didn't thrive on those conditions, you'd have stopped reading this screed long ago.
## THE END OF THE MERCENARY
The battlefield is changing. As I've pointed out, precious few people still fight all-out wars. Few nations or corps have or are willing to spend the vast financial resources needed for such a venture. As always, manpower is cheap but the tools of warfare are not. Subterfuge, espionage, and counterespionage have replaced armies of tanks as the tools for solving national problems.
This is good.
Sure, ultimately it means less work for me, but it also means fewer threats to life and limb for everyone else. I'd rather see the world's problems resolved with small skirmishes, police actions, and brushfire wars. Better that than the alternative.
What does this mean for my profession? It means we must adapt. I believe that future battles will be fought by small units wielding incredibly sophisticated weapons capable of focusing more firepower than you or I can even imagine, and magic will also play an important part.
I foresee that the soldier of the future will be part mage, part mercenary, and part metal. Mercs like us won't be part of that battlefield. We will still be part of the battlefield where the real people fight. We'll be where people bleed, and hurt, and fight for causes they believe in. We'll be standing next to them, waiting for the charge. Maybe I'll see you there.
> (Don't count on it.) -Smiley (21:17:17/01-04-55)
