# FIELDS OF FIRE - Rules
This section offers combat rules expansions, clarifications, and options in response to player and gamemaster questions and comments. An expanded Weapon Range Table that provides ranges for all Shadowrun weapons published to date, including the new weapons described in this book, appears at the end of this section.
## DEVELOPER NOTES
This sourcebook exposes and explains the shadowy realm of the mercenary. This sourcebook is not about playing a mercenary storyline, but about playing a mercenary character within the Shadowrun storyline. In the former case, all the player characters are mercenaries and the story objectives have purely mercenary origins and direction. In the latter, the mercenary player character plays a specific part shaped by his unique experiences, viewpoint, and attitude. Creative gamemasters may find enough information in this sourcebook to create a "mercs-only" spin-off of Shadowrun, but this book was not designed with that outcome in mind. (Good luck, though, to those who decide to go for it!) 
This book also includes plenty of gear. Mercs like toys as much as street samurai do, and this book presents a hefty cross-section of useful, fun equipment. As one might expect, the classifications of merc toys and street sam toys overlap pretty far. After all, it isn't really, "He who dies with the most toys wins," but, "He who uses his toys best wins." Some equipment described in this book duplicates information and gear from previous Shadowrun products, because feedback from Shadowrun players and gamemasters indicated that the public wanted more information about a specific item or a game mechanic related to that item's use. To make life easier for players and gamemasters, both existing and new information has been grouped into one place. With regard to the rules expansions, clarifications, and combat options offered in this section, FASA sends abject apologies to those who might have received conflicting adjudications to these rules questions some time in the past.
### CHOOSING OPTIONAL RULES
Consider all the rules clarifications, expansions, and options in this sourcebook as optional suggestions for play. As always, gamemasters and players should review these rules before beginning play and agree on which ones to use. The gamemaster and players are also the final arbiters of how rules should be interpreted.
### EXPANSIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
The following expansions and clarifications refer to the existing rules printed in Shadowrun, Second Edition (1992). Page references for that book are provided where necessary.
## ARMOR DEGRADATION
For the sake of simplified bookkeeping, SRII ignored the effects of armor degradation. The following rule takes armor degradation into account. A character who takes a Moderate wound or greater damage from a non-Stun attack suffers armor damage. The armor loses 1 point for every multiple of its appropriate value represented by the Power of the attack. For example, a character wearing an armored jacket takes a hit from a submachine gun burst with a Damage Code of 10S. The jacket has a Ballistic Rating of 5. If the character takes at least Moderate damage, the attack permanently reduces the rating of the armor by 2 points. This rule also applies to Impact armor. Hardened body or vehicle armor (but not critter armor) degrades at the same rate.
## ATHLETIC TESTS
The following rules apply to resolving Athletics Tests, specifically for running, jumping, climbing, swimming and so on. Some of the material below first appeared in SRII and other sources. In all instances, Damage Modifiers (p. 112, SRII) apply.
### Climbing
Characters normally perform one of two types of climbing: unassisted and assisted. Unassisted climbing is exactly what it sounds like-the character climbs on the strength of his or her own ability. Assisted climbing involves the use of climbing equipment. Make the Climbing Test (requiring a Complex Action) against a target number reflecting the difficulty of the obstacle being climbed. The gamemaster determines the base target number by how easy the surface is to climb (craggy, sheer, and so on), modified by the height of the obstacle and the current environmental conditions.
CLIMBING TABLE

| Condition                                             | Target Number |
| ----------------------------------------------------- |:-------------:|
| Easily climbable surface (i.e., chain link fence)     |       3       |
| Broken surface (i.e., debris, tree, loose stone wall) |       5       |
| Flat surface (i.e., brick wall, side of old building) |       8       |
| Sheer surface (i.e., metal wall, seamless stone)      |      14       |

| Height                                      |    Modifier |
| ------------------------------------------- | -----------:|
| less than 2 meters                          | No modifier |
| 2-4 meters                                  |          +2 |
| 4+ meters                                   |          +4 |
| Obstacle is slippery or wet                 |          +2 |
| Obstacle is greased, gel-treated, and so on |          +4 |

Characters can normally climb upward a number of meters each turn equal to one-quarter (25 percent) the average of their Quickness and Strength (round down). For each success from the Climbing Test, add 2 to the average of Quickness and Strength for this calculation. Climbing down is easier: characters can move down a number of meters equal to twice the average of their Quickness and Strength. (Characters can, of course, elect to climb down really quickly. See Falling rules, p. 76.) Assisted climbing makes the upward climb slower, but allows the character to overcome the conditions listed in the Climbing Table. Assisted climbing requires the use of climbing gear (see Field Pack, p. 56). When using climbing gear, modify the base target number for the Climbing Test by -10, making a Climbing Test once every three minutes to reflect the time it takes to safely position the climbing gear on the surface being climbed. Assisted climbing down, known as rappelling, is a lot faster. With the proper equipment, rappelling allows characters to make a controlled descent at close to freefall speeds and introduces the handy ability to slow the descent and land safely. A rappelling character falls at a rate of 20 meters per Simple Action expended. Note that only one of the two Simple Actions available in a Combat Phase can be expended in this manner. Yes, this means that a character can rappel and shoot in the same Action Phase, but must add a +4 modifier to both the Firearms Test and the Climbing Test. Rappelling characters increase the number of meters descended that Action Phase by 1 for each success from a Climbing (4) Test. When the character reaches the bottom (or his destination), he must make another Climbing (4) Test. On an unsuccessful test, the character falls 4 meters and takes appropriate damage. See Falling, below. If the Rule of One applies during any Climbing Test, the character plummets the full distance to the ground. Benevolent gamemasters may allow the character to make a Quickness (6) Test to grab something and prevent the fall.
### Falling
All falls have a Damage Level of "D", with the Power of the fall's "attack" being one-half the number of meters fallen (round down). The character may use Body dice for a Damage Resistance Test to reduce the damage. Subtract one-half (round down) of the character's impact armor rating from the Power of the fall. Characters may also make an Athletics Test against a target number equal to the full distance fallen (in meters). Each success from this test also reduces the Power of the fall by 1. A falling character has a "Falling Action" every 10 Combat Phases. At that time the character is considered to have fallen a number of additional meters equal to 20 meters times the number of "Falling Actions" (including the current one) spent in rapid descent. A falling character has an Initiative of 30 for every turn until the character lands. For those gamemasters counting in real-time, remember that a falling body plummets at an acceleration rate of about 10 meters/per second/per second. The falling character drops 10 meters in the first second, 20 more meters in the second, 30 more meters in the third, and so on. The reason for the difference in the falling rate values (20 in SRII rules and 10 in real life) is that the SRII Combat Turn takes up an abstract amount of time of between 3 and 5 seconds, depending on what happens. The 20 value seemed like a good compromise. Feel free to modify it, however.
### Holding One's Breath
A character can hold his or her breath for 30 seconds for each point of his or her Body. A character who wants to hold his breath longer makes a Body (4) Test. Each success increases the length of time the character can hold his breath by 10 percent (round down).
### Jumping
Characters can make four types of jumps: standing jumps, running jumps, standing vertical jumps, and running vertical jumps. From a standing start, a character can jump a number of meters equal to his one-half his Strength minus his natural Body (unaugmented by cyberware, bioware, or magic). For a running jump, the character may add his Quickness (Quickness + Strength - Body + 2 = meters jumped). Use the same formulas for jumping vertically from a standing or running start, but divide the result by 4. To increase the distance jumped, a character makes a Jumping Test against a target number equal to the number of meters the character is trying to clear. Each success increases the distance jumped by 10 percent (round down). A failed jump or a jump down may result in falling (see Falling, p. 76).
### Lifting/Throwing
A character can lift 25 kilograms per point of his Strength without making any sort of test. To represent augmented strength, the character makes a Strength Test against a target number equal to the weight of the object being lifted, divided by 10 (round up). Each success increases the weight lifted by 10 percent (round down). Note that this rule applies to a simple lift off the ground. A character can only lift over his head an object that weighs 12 kilograms per point of Strength. In this case, apply the Strength Test normally. Once a character lifts an object over his head, he can throw that object a number of meters equal to the character's Strength, minus the object's weight divided by 50 (round down). To increase the distance thrown, make a Strength Test against a target number equal to the weight of the object being lifted divided by 10 (round up). For every 2 successes, the object flies an additional meter.
### Running
The Movement rules appear on p. 83, SRII. Characters with the Running Skill may attempt to increase the distance they can run by spending a Complex Action (Use Skill). Each success against a Target Number of 4 increases the character's effective Quickness by 1 point for that Combat Phase. The gamemaster may apply modifiers for various types of terrain (slippery, rocky, and so on) and other conditions.
### Swimming
Use the same rules to determine swimming speed and distance as for running, except divide all resulting distances by 4.
## BATTLETAC™M SYSTEM
The most straightforward way to explain the benefits of the BattleTac™ and similar systems is to say that everyone using the system can freely exchange various types of data and information without restriction. This data may include map positioning, enemy positioning, current status, targeting data, video and aural information, tactical requests and commands, and anything else of import to the soldier. When the system is operating, any piece of data known to one member of the "battle network" is known to all. For example, if one soldier sees an advancing enemy unit, all others in the "network" instantly know that force's composition, direction, heading, and speed. Other members in the network can use this data as spotting information and call for indirect fire against that target, or maneuver to intercept or ambush those forces. Because all members of the BattleTac™ unit see all information simultaneously, the unit can move like a wellprogrammed machine and react quickly to changing battlefield conditions. The BattleTac™ system works in a manner similar to the telecommunication system described on p. xx. Use the ratings given for that system to represent signal security and encryption efficiency. If a system has BattleTac™ capability, multiply all prices by 10.
## CAMOUFLAGE AND PERCEPTION
The modifiers given below apply to visual Perception Tests made to detect opponents wearing camouflage clothing. A moving character qualifies for
the "Action very obvious" modifier (see p. 185, SRII).

| Situation                                                     | Modifier |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | --------:|
| Appropriate camouflage clothing (i.e., woodland in the woods) |       +4 |
| Inappropriate camouflage clothing (i.e., desert in the woods) |       -2 |
## CASED VS. CASELESS AMMO
The Shadowrun rules and fiction occasionally mention caseless ammunition. Caseless ammunition is made without a brass or plastic casing holding the propellant. Instead, the propellant is a solid mass attached to the tail of the bullet, and burns completely away when fired. Caseless ammunition exists in fact as well as in fiction. The following rules apply to caseless ammo. For the sake of simplicity, assume that any modern firearm (post-2050) can be acquired in a model that fires caseless ammunition. Increase the base cost by 50 percent and the Availability by +1. 
-Caseless ammunition is available at 150 percent of the base cost. Increase the Availability by +1. 
-Caseless ammunition takes up slightly less space than cased ammunition. Increase the number of rounds a caseless weapon can load by 20 percent (round down). Caseless ammo also weighs less, so reduce the appropriate weights by 20 percent (round up). 
-Caseless ammunition cannot be used in a weapon designed to fire cased ammunition, and vice versa. All other normal firearms rules apply.
## COMBAT ACCIDENTS
The following variant on the Rule of One creates a greater chance of provoking accidental mayhem in combat. In ranged or melee combat, if the player rolls all of his dice (Skill dice, Combat Pool dice, Enhancement dice, everything) and achieves a number of ones equal to or greater than the number of base Skill dice used for the test, the result is an "Oops." The gamemaster determines the appropriate "Oops" for each situation. For inspiration, see the Stray Shots optional rule, p. 93, SRII. The character may also break, jam, or drop his weapon. Be creative. Yes, the character can spend Karma to avoid the "Oops" per the rules given on p. 191, SRII.
## COVER MODIFIERS
The SRII rules for ranged combat offer only a rudimentary modifier for obscured targets, called Partial Cover (-4). The following optional rules expand the uses of that modifier. Attacking characters who want to use cover to protect against return fire may choose the amount of cover they use, represented by a +2, +4, or +6 modifier. The attacking character must also modify the target number by one-half the cover modifier. For example, a character partially concealing himself behind +4 cover must add a +2 modifier to his attack because of that cover. (Hey, hiding is awkward for you, too.) Gamemasters may need to determine the amount of cover protecting a target, especially when that cover is environmental and coincidental (characters fighting in the woods, an amusement park, and so on). The gamemaster should base the modifier on how much of the target is visible, using the Partial Cover Table below as a guideline.
The gamemaster should judge how much of the target can be seen in terms of an overall area. For example, if the gamemaster judges that the various areas of the target (big and small) that can be seen through the brush totals about 48.5 percent, the modifier would be +4.
PARTIAL COVER TABLE

| Percent of Target Visible |        Modifier |
| ------------------------- | ---------------:|
| 76-100                    |     No modifier |
| 51-75                     |              +2 |
| 26-50                     |              +4 |
| 1-25                      |              +6 |
| 0                         | +8 (Blind Fire) |
## COVERING/SUPPRESSION FIRE
A character may declare that he is making a ranged attack to provide covering/suppression fire. This means that the attacker is directing fire into an area to force his opponents to keep their heads down for fear of being hit. Covering/suppression fire usually allows the character's teammates to perform some action unopposed. Each round fired effectively covers a 1-meter area for 10 Combat Phases. Multiple rounds may be targeted at a single 1-meter area to increase the effectiveness of the covering/suppression fire. If the attack covers multiple areas, these areas must be directly adjacent to another covered area. If, during the time that the area is covered, a character enters that area, moves, and thereby exposes himself to the covering/suppression fire, or presents his body to fire within that area in any manner, he might be hit. If line of sight can be drawn from the attacker to any part of the target during the time the area is covered, the target is potentially vulnerable. To determine if the covering/suppression fire strikes the target character, resolve a Ranged Attack against the target by rolling a number of dice equal to the number of rounds fired at the area. The Target Number equals a base of 4 modified only by Cover and any Damage Modifier the attacker must add. Every 2 successes generated results in 1 round striking the target, up to a maximum of the number of rounds fired into the area.
## CUSTOM WEAPONS
The owner of a weapon can customize its grip and balance at a cost of 100 percent of the base weapon cost. The work takes a weaponsmith approximately three days to complete. A weapon customized for a particular character allows him to roll an additional skill die when using this weapon. A character who uses a weapon customized for someone else must subtract 1 die from his skill roll.
## DELAYED ACTIONS AND SHORT MOVES
Characters who choose to Delay their Action may move up to one-half (round up) their Walking rate during the Combat Phase of their original Initiative. When the character makes the Delayed Action, he may move normally. Josh, a street samurai, is slowly advancing down a corridor, watching the door at the end. His Initiative is 23, and so he Delays his action in Combat Phase 23. At that time, he moves 3 meters down the corridor (half his normal walking movement). His next action would normally take place in Combat Phase 13. He maintains the Delayed Action, but advances another 3 meters at that time. He continues to Delay his actions and move until he reaches the door.
## DELAYED GRENADE RULES
Shadowrun grenades can be fired, scatter, and detonate all within one Combat Phase (a fraction of a second). The system resolves grenade attacks in this manner simply to cut down on the bookkeeping required. Ambitious gamemasters and players may want to apply the following delayed grenade rule. Grenades detonate 5 Combat Phases after firing. During that time another character with an available action (either a Delayed Action or normal Initiative) may retrieve the grenade and attempt to throw it back. Characters must achieve at least 1 success on a Quickness (8) Test to pick up a bouncing, jumping, skittering, mini-grenade. To pick up a regular-sized grenade, characters must make a successful Quickness (6) Test. If the test is unsuccessful, the character is at an effective Range of 0 when the grenade detonates. Have fun!
## INSTANT DEATH AND OVER-DAMAGE
As written, the SRII rules make it effectively impossible to kill an unwounded character with a single attack. In fact, an unwounded character can technically survive a nuclear blast at ground zero, because the nuke only does "D" damage with no Body Overflow. Though such a result may look like an oversight, it was a deliberate choice to avoid the potential disappointment of having a player character taken down by a single attack, especially an unexpected attack or one against which the character cannot defend himself. In certain situations, however, this choice becomes ludicrous. In these cases, apply the following rule. Normally, after a weapon's Damage Level has been staged up to "D," additional successes are ignored. If the Power of the attack is greater than twice (2x) the Body Rating of the target, the gamemaster may invoke the Over-Damage rule. With this rule, every 2 additional successes translate into 1 additional point of damage applied against the Physical Condition Monitor (if the attack was Deadly Stun) or Body Overflow (if the attack was Deadly Physical). For example, using the OverDamage rule, assume a character with a Body of 3 is struck by a 7M attack. The attacker stages the damage for a final Damage Level of Deadly, with an additional 4 successes remaining in the attacker's favor. The character takes a Deadly wound and 2 points of Body Overflow, leaving him with 1 point remaining and ten minutes until he bleeds to death. If the attacker had achieved 2 additional successes, the poor character would be instantly dead. Use this rule cautiously: in addition to conveniently killing those nasty bad guys, this rule handily kills favorite player characters who might otherwise have narrowly survived to run the shadows another day.
## LOW-LIGHT AND THERMAL SYSTEMS
The following information elaborates on the fundamental characteristics, differences, and capabilities of lowlight and thermographic systems. Theory and application has been streamlined for simplicity and playability. Low-Light Systems Also known as night sight, night vision, or light amplification, low-light systems involve an electronic process that creates a coherent electronic image by amplifying and processing even the tiniest amount of available light. If no light is available, however, even the best low-light system becomes useless. The gamemaster has the final say on whether a situation offers sufficient light for a low-light system to work. He or she simply decides if light is present. If not, then the low-light system has no light to amplify and therefore has no effect. If light is present, even in such faint sources as moonlight leaking through low cloud cover or traces of a streetlight filtering into an abandoned basement, then the low-light system has something to amplify.
### LOW-LIGHT
The low-light system itself can provide the light required for its use as either direct or area lighting. For example, direct lighting could come from a penlight that throws a focused beam of light. Even the tiniest glow from a penlight, which cannot be seen from more than a few meters away, can illuminate a map, a sign, or similar small area or object well enough to create an image on the system's screen. Characters who carry low-light systems usually attach a penlight or similar pinpoint light source to a helmet or their finger to provide direct, subtle illumination on demand. An area light combined with a low-light system is sufficient to allow the person so equipped to move. This light need not cover a large area; it could be as directional as a flashlight that subtly illuminates the area ahead of the user. Such a light will be visible for some distance, but only if the observer is looking into the beam. Low-light systems are technologically based, and so magic cannot be cast through them. The nature of lowlight vision requires an electronic amplification of light, by definition a translation of the image to electronic form. Because low-light cybereyes have been paid for with Essence, however, the system becomes an accepted part of a character's body and can be used to cast magic. Optical low-light systems use high-quality optics, lenses, and/or mirrors rather than electronic imaging. Their light-gathering capabilities are limited by the size of the gathering lens. Effectively fancy telescopes, optical low-light systems are not portable.
### Thermographic Systems
Thermographic systems read heat (infrared energy) emitted by a target. This type of system provides few details about the target, because it reveals only degrees of heat. SRII assumes that modern (2050) thermal systems actually superimpose the thermographic display over a basic, amplified low-light display for better detail. The result provides insufficient data to gain a bonus or modifier, but does allow the user to navigate past obstacles or differentiate between objects while using the system. Different systems use different color scales to represent the levels of heat, but most use the following standard. Hot objects (an engine block, a pot of boiling water) show as white, while cool objects (room temperature) show as black, with every temperature difference in between displaying as shades of red or green. Remember that the system judges "hot" and "cold" in relation to the local air or room temperature. For example, thermographic systems used outside in the winter easily spot a person or vehicle, because they will appear "hot" compared to the air temperature. On the other hand, in the rain forests of South America little difference exists between the ambient temperature (the forest's "room temperature") and the radiated body heat of a human being, making thermographic systems all but useless for differentiating between the forest and a person. (Odds are that motion will give the target away, but that's a different modifier.) When characters are using thermographic systems, the gamemaster must consider the relative temperature of objects viewed against the ambient temperature to determine if the system detects the target. In other words, objects at a similar temperature show up on the display as similar colors, making it difficult to differentiate between them if they overlap. By definition, thermographic systems also require technology and cannot be used when casting magic. Because the user has paid Essence for thermographic cybereyes, however, the system becomes an accepted part of a character's body and can be used to cast magic. Natural Low-Light and Thermal Vision Natural low-light or thermographic vision, such as the vision elves and dwarfs are born with, or the enhanced senses available to a physical adept or critter, is magical in nature. This type of vision works along principles similar to those of low-light and thermographic systems, but performs better than any technology can. Though a certain biological basis exists to explain this visual ability, much of the effect can only be explained through the application of magic. Natural low-light or thermographic vision is assumed to be always operating, providing vision enhancements automatically as needed. For example, a troll sees exactly what humans see when looking at the same view, except that every object, person, and so on is tinged with the heat it radiates. The hotter an object, the more brilliant the color the troll sees. Objects that are much hotter than their environment appear whiter, surrounded by a faint glow. Trolls see this way normally, and therefore can instantly perceive, process, and interpret what they see. Natural low-light or thermal vision is an advantage, not a handicap.
## MAXIMUM RATE OF FIRE
The following information offers a comprehensive version of the Shadowrun maximum rate of weapon fire. ·Regular weapons capable of burst-fire (see p.92, SRII) fire 3 rounds per burst. A character can fire these rounds twice within a Combat Phase (See Fire Weapon, p.82, SRII).
-Regular weapons capable of full-auto fire (see pp. 92-93, SRII) can fire up to 10 rounds in 1 Combat Phase. The firer may use these 10 rounds to make as many fullauto bursts of between 3 and 10 rounds per burst as he wishes, up to a maximum of 10 total rounds that Combat Phase.
-Minigun-class weapons can fire up to 15 rounds per Combat Phase using the full-auto mode rules (pp. 92-93, SRII). The weapon always fires 15 rounds if those rounds are available.
-Super machinegun-class weapons (new to this sourcebook) fire a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat Phase. They fire six-round bursts in burst-fire mode, and full-auto bursts of between 6 and 15 rounds per burst, up to a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat Phase. The Shadowrun Combat Turn does not limit the maximum number of rounds that a weapon can discharge within that turn. The cyclic or recycle rates of the various weapons are assumed to be high enough to support the rates of fire cited above. A modern-day submachine gun has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, or 10 rounds per second. Shadowrun weapons have lower cyclic rates in the interests of game balance, practicality, survivability, and sanity.
## MERCENARY CONTACTS
The mercenary equivalent of the fixer, known as the dealer (same game statistics, different area of influence), serves as the merc's source for weapons and equipment. Even more so than the fixer, the dealer traffics regularly in arms and accessories and therefore can more easily get merc-related equipment, though the player character must wait longer to receive it. The dealer has more pipelines to work through than the fixer does, but the flow is slower.
To reflect this fact, decrease the target numbers for acquisition through a dealer by -1 and increase the Time Required by 25 percent (round down). The dealer contact should only be available to characters with a legitimate mercenary background. Gamemasters should enforce this restriction to maintain game balance. Only legitimate current or past members of the League can work with a dealer.
## OFF-HAND TRAINING
Off-hand training represents a character's ambidextrous ability acquired through the Special Skill: Ambidexterity. A character can only acquire this skill during character creation. It cannot be learned during game play. This Special Skill costs 3 Skill Points per point of Skill Rating. The Skill Rating can later be increased using the normal rules for increasing a General Skill (p.190, SRII). This Special Skill is used in a unique way. Any time the character attempts to use his off-hand (non-dominant hand), he must apply a negative modifier to the target number equal to the appropriate Skill Rating, minus the Special Skill. So, a character with a Firearms Skill of 5 and Ambidexterity of 3 attempting to shoot with her offhand must apply a -2 (5 - 3) modifier. An Ambidexterity Skill Rating higher than the rating of the skill being used has no effect. 
When using multiple firearms, characters must also apply the Using A Second Firearm modifier (p. 90, SRII). 
Second Weapon In Melee Combat Characters may learn armed melee combat styles that allow them to use a second weapon. The following rules represent the effects of using a second melee weapon in combat.
-The second weapon must be physically smaller and lighter than the dominant weapon, unless they are both small weapons (such as knives or daggers). 
-The character must know how to use each of the two weapons individually. (Yes, they may both fall under the general skill Armed Combat.)
-The character must acquire a Special Skill for the fighting style (Rapier and Dagger, and so on). A character using two weapons in combat makes his Attack Test by rolling a base number of dice equal to the character's combined individual skills in the two weapons. The character may add a number of Combat Pool dice up to a maximum equal to the Special Skill rating. Resolve damage by finding the average of the two weapons used. First, calculate an unmodified average of the Power of both weapons. If one weapon has a higher Damage Level than the other, subtract 1 level from the higher Damage Level and use the result as the Damage. For example, a character using a sword with an "M" Damage Level and a knife with an "L" Damage Level would use an "L" Damage Level. Resolve the use of both weapons with a single test using the Power calculated above. Remember that Shadowrun melee combat is not resolved blow by blow. Instead, each Attack Test is an abstraction or amalgamation of a series of moves, blows, feints, parries, and countermoves. All other melee combat rules apply normally. The stats for typical weapons used in two-weapon combat appear below, abstracted in order to avoid printing a list of virtually identical weapons differentiated only by their names.

| Weapon            | Concealability | Reach | Damage      | Weight | Cost |
| ----------------- | -------------- | ----- | ----------- | ------ | ----:|
| Light Sword       | 4              | 1     | (Str + 1) M | .75    | 700¥ |
| Long Knife/Dagger | 6              | 0     | (Str + 2) L | .5     | 150¥ |
## PHYSICAL AND STUN DAMAGE
Characters may use weapons listed as inflicting Stun Damage to inflict Physical Damage, such as clubs, fists, and so on. A character who wishes to inflict Physical Damage using a weapon normally rated as doing Stun Damage must add a +4 modifier to the target number. The Damage Code of the weapon remains the same, but the attack results in Physical Damage rather than Stun Damage.
## PULLING PUNCHES
Characters in melee combat can elect to "pull their punches." To pull a punch, the player must state how many successes are being "pulled" to lessen the blow before the Attack Test is resolved. Increase the target number by +1 and resolve the test normally. Determine the total number of successes, then subtract the number of successes being "pulled" from that value. Make this calculation as soon as the successes are generated, but before comparing the attacker's total successes to the opponent's total successes. Characters can also choose to decrease the effect of a ranged attack. To do this, add a +4 modifier to the target number, then follow the rules given above. 
## RECOIL AND STRENGTH
The following rule suggests a way to allow characters who possess extraordinary Strength to suffer less from firearm recoil than characters with standard Strength. Because many characters with high Strength Ratings rely heavily on firearms, this rule makes the game even deadlier. (The troll carrying the light machine gun should love this rule.)
RECOIL REDUCTION TABLE

| Strength | Recoil Reduction |
| -------- | ----------------:|
| 1-4      |             None |
| 5-6      |               -1 |
| 7-8      |               -2 |
| 9-10     |               -3 |
| 11-12    |               -4 |
For every 2 full points of a character's Strength Rating above 3, the character gains 1 level of Recoil Reduction, as shown on the Recoil Reduction Table below.
## SENSOR TARGETING OF HUMANS
Vehicle sensors can target people using an effective Signature of 8. See Sensor-Enhanced Targeting, p.106, Rigger Black Book.
### SENTRY GUNS
The Sentry™ system uses microtronic technology similar to the tactical computer found on p. 53, Shadowtech. A tactical computer is a dedicated system designed to keep track of all relevant combat data. The computer derives its information from all available sensing devices, which means it is not foolproof. If the sensor cannot provide the appropriate information, the computer may not be able to make correct decisions. Each individual extra sensor type (low-light, audio, ultrasound) increases the tactical computer's Level by 1. Access to a digital softmap of the area adds 2 to the tactical computer's Intelligence. A tactical computer can keep track of, or "mark," and predict movements of a number of targets equal to its Intelligence Rating. To successfully mark a target, the tactical computer must make a Success Test pitting its Intelligence against a target number based on the range to the target (using standard shotgun ranges). Apply all appropriate situation modifiers for ranged combat (p. 88-90, SRII). The extra successes generated for each target serve as the system's Success Level for that target. The target can shake the computer's marking by breaking out of the Sentry system's line of sight. Doing so forces the computer to attempt to re-acquire the target when the target becomes visible again. To attempt to reacquire the target, roll a number of dice equal to the system's Intelligence against a Base Target Number 1, modified by +1 for every meter the target moved while out of line of sight and +1 for every full Combat Turn that has passed. If this test succeeds, the Success Level for that target is now based on the successes generated in the test. If the test is unsuccessful, the computer can attempt to remark the target on the system's next action. An accurate map of the area in computer memory or accessible over a data network (gamemaster's discretion) reduces the target number of the Re-acquisition Test by -3. The targeting feature and trajectory computation adds an additional number of dice equal to the previously generated Success Level for a target to all Ranged Combat Success Tests against that target. This modifier applies only to those targets marked by the tactical system. All system functions are background tasks, requiring no actions to call up or perform. Though an attempt at a new marking after a failed re-acquisition does not cost an action, the computer can only attempt a new marking during the system's action. When the Sentry™ system fires on a target, use a Skill Rating of 5, adding the following modifiers if using the Enhanced Targeting option: +1 Enhanced Targeting is installed and an additional +1 per additional integrated sensor. Resolve this combat per the normal rules.
## SHOTGUN SOUND SUPPRESSION
Practically speaking, shotguns cannot use a silencer or the rules that apply to it. A character using a shotgun firing only slug rounds rather than shot/flechette rounds, however, can install a sound suppresser. A shotgun equipped with sound suppression cannot fire shot/flechette rounds that use or require a choke. A shotgun blast is the aural equivalent of full-auto fire. Shotguns that can fire in burst or full-auto modes cannot be equipped with a sound suppresser.
## SMALL UNIT TACTICS
Characters with the Military Science Skill (ideally coupled with the Small Unit Tactics Specialization) can gain an Initiative bonus for their teammates under certain circumstances. The character with Small Unit Tactics must make his or her last action of the Combat Turn a Complex Action (Skill Use), even if he or she has only one action available. The character then makes the Skill Test against a base Target Number of 4, with the following considerations and modifiers. ·The character with tactical skill must be in contact or communication with everyone who is to receive the Initiative bonus.
-If the character with tactical skill has only radio (or similar) communication with his team members, add a +2 modifier to the Skill Test target number.
-If all members of the team are linked by the BattleTac™ system (see Field Pack, p. 59) or another similar system, apply a -2 modifier.
-Apply all appropriate Damage Modifiers. Team members in communication with the character possessing tactical skill receive a bonus to their Initiative for the next Combat Turn equal to +1 for every 2 successes the tactical character generates. The tactical character may add Karma Pool dice to his Skill Test. This bonus also applies in surprise and ambush situations. See p. 86, SRII.
## SMARTLINK LEVEL II
The Smartlink Level II hardware and software represents an evolutionary increase in smartgun technology. Most of the changes have no effect in game terms; the Smartlink simply feels better and works more efficiently. Smartlink Level II offers the following game system benefits.
-Smartlink Level II software can integrate with a rangefinder to provide an additional -1 target modifier at long range and a -2 target modifier at extreme range.
-Called Shots (p. 92, SRII) are easier to make with Smartlink Level II. Apply a +4 Called Shot modifier when using Smartlink Level II.
-Smartlink Level II can calculate indirect-fire arcs, applying a -1 modifier for linked weapons such as under-barrel grenade launchers, grenade guns, and the like. This benefit also applies to rocket launchers and similar systems, but not to missile launchers and other systems with an inherent Intelligence Rating.
## SMOKE RULES
Smoke can be deployed using a grenade or other smoke-producing device. The amount of smoke produced is limited by the size of the device used. How long the smoke lasts depends on the environment. If the smoke is deployed in an area with no wind, the smoke lingers in the area of impact until the duration expires. If the smoke is deployed in an area with wind, the smoke cloud will stretch and thin out in the direction the wind is blowing. Gamemasters can use the Scatter diagram (p. 97, SRII) to determine wind direction. To determine wind speed and its effects on duration, roll one six-sided die. The result is the number of Combat Turns it takes for the center (the bulk) of the smoke to drift 1 meter in the direction of the wind. Next, divide the smoke's duration by the result of the roll. The result represents the smoke's new duration as it dissipates in the wind. If the characters involved are exchanging gunfire or attempting to observe something, the gamemaster must determine on a case-by-case basis whether the characters can see through an area of thinning smoke (Light Smoke per p. 89, SRII) or if the bulk of the smoke obstructs their actions (Heavy Smoke per p. 89, SRII).

## TARGET DESIGNATORS
Target designators mark a target and assist in aiming. The simplest target designator is the laser sight, which emits a beam of visible laser light that strikes the target and marks it with a red dot. The dot lets the firer know exactly where he or she is aiming and allows him to adjust the shot. All target designators operate on variations of this principle. With regard to more complicated designators, the individual using the target designator is not the individual firing the weapon; that individual could be kilometers away. The weapon may even be automated and fired by remote command. The two basic types of target designators are laser sights and reflected-energy designators.
### Laser Sight
The basic laser sight described on p. 240, SRII can mark a target with a visible red dot at a distance of up to 500 meters at night and 50 meters during the day. Smoke and other environmental conditions, however, may block this laser sight. Divide the listed range by 2 for light rain, mist, or fog, by 4 for heavy rain, mist, fog, or smoke, and by 10 for downpours and very thick smoke. To find a laser sight's day range under these conditions, divide the listed night range by 10. Characters using a laser sight gain a -1 modifier to their ranged combat target number if they can see the dot. The high-powered laser sight is a more powerful version of the basic sight. It offers a night range of 1,500 meters and a day range of 150 meters. The same environment and target modifier rules apply. Reflected-Energy Designators A reflected-energy designator effectively functions as an even higher-powered laser sight, but serves a different purpose. A designator is designed to mark a target with reflected energy such as laser light, microwave, or radar. A weapon with the appropriate tracking/seeker head can then home in on this reflected energy. In all cases, the weapon skill of the character using the designator determines whether the weapon (regardless of the type) hits the target. Weapons that home in on designated targets require that the designator keep the beam (laser, microwave, or radar) on the target. For laser designators (which can be top-mounted on a rifle sized weapon), the designating character uses the Firearms (Rifle) Skill. For microwave or radar designators, use the character's Gunnery Skill. All normal ranged combat rules apply, but consult the Weapon Range Table on p. 87 of this book for the designator in use. Note that microwave and radar designators can be mounted on a tripod for field use or vehicle mounted. (To mount one on a vehicle requires 1 CF or cargo area; see p. 113, Rigger Black Book.) Smoke blocks laser designators, and chaff blocks microwave and radar designators. For game purposes, assume that the mere presence of smoke or chaff intervening between the target and the designator blocks the beam. (Reality is more complex, but this rule is not intended as a military simulation.) The gamemaster must determine on a case-by-case basis the location of emitted smoke or chaff in relation to the position of the designator. Also, for the sake of simplicity, assume that all missile or rocket weapons have a flight-time of 1,000 meters per Combat Turn.
## TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
The Phillips Tacticom system described on p. 58 of this book is a sophisticated piece of military electronics. The statistics for the system, however, are also representative of other brands and systems that serve a similar function. For example, the statistics for the two master units work equally well for vehicle systems, the larger master unit available for vehicles with the available space (or budget), and the smaller, lighter portable master unit fitting into vehicles that offer less room. This equipment conforms with the Using Equipment rules, p. 184, SRII. It has an ECM/ECCM Rating equal to the rating of the equipment. The large master unit has a tactical range of 30 kilometers, the portable master unit a range of 20 kilometers. The manufacturer designed the Tacticom system with this short range to ensure signal security and reduce the probability of long-range detection. Communication is two-way voice-only. The master units are encrypted at the rating of the equipment. Individual team members carry the system's personal comm unit: with a range of 12 kilometers, also made deliberately short for greater security. Note that beyond 12 kilometers these units can receive messages from a master unit, but cannot respond. ‹ The microwave link is a small, flat-transmitter microwave system that provides greater signal security by virtue of its position at line-of-sight to the horizon. This same feature also creates a disadvantage because the user must be able to trace a direct line of sight between the link's sender and receiver. The microwave signal is only marginally affected by weather, and can only be intercepted by someone or something lying on or very close to the path of the microwave beam. Because the real workings of microwave communication systems and other systems equally subtle and involved are beyond the effective scope of Shadowrun, gamemasters should use these guidelines to rule on the many and varied circumstances that are bound to arise during play. The laser link works on a principle similar to the microwave link, except that communication relies on a laser beam. This system also requires a direct line of sight, but a tighter beam and virtually nonexistent leakage creates higher signal security. Laser links have a range out to the horizon in clear weather, but range degrades radically in inclement weather. Heavy rain, fog, or smoke renders the system virtually useless. Satellite uplinks bounce the signal off a communications satellite and down to the master unit. The uplink contains all the software necessary for satellite tracking and linking. This system provides high signal security and minimal atmospheric interference.
## WHITE PHOSPHORUS
White phosphorus is a chemical that burns at very high temperatures when exposed to air. Early smoke grenades spread a curtain of white phosphorus, which created smoke, caused secondary-effect casualties, and ignited combustible materials. Modern (2050) smoke grenades work on the same principle, but burn a less lethal substance to create smoke. Various suppliers still produce white phosphorus weapons, but their smoke-producing effects are secondary to their incendiary and damage effects. Grenades and mortar rounds designed to deliver white phosphorus have two Damage Codes, the first representing the small blast effect of the actual explosion and the second representing the lingering effect of the white phosphorus. The chemical affects all targets within the area of effect equally. The phosphorous burns continuously for 15 Combat Turns, inflicting the indicated damage every Combat Turn (resolved at the start of each turn during the first Combat Phase). Characters can resist this damage using Body dice only. Impact Armor reduces the Power of the attack. White phosphorus is difficult to extinguish because it re-ignites whenever exposed to air. Water diffuses white phosphorus; if an affected area or target can be immersed or doused with water, the chemical's effects end in 2 Combat Turns.
