### MAGIC
Ideally, characters should view magic in the **Shadowrun** universe as a mysterious, unpredictable force that exposes its users to great risk, as well as providing them with great power. However, as players have grown increasingly familiar with the magic rules over the past few years, characters no longer fear magic's random and unpredictable nature. In addition, some magician characters have amassed enormous powers that disrupt game balance and make the life of their teams much safer—and a lot less fun. The rules in this section are designed to remedy these problems by providing gamemasters with new ways to inject more unpredictability and danger into the use of magic, restrict the power of magician characters, and reduce the total amount of magic in their games.

Those players anxiously awaiting a dramatic, noticeable rise in the magic level of the universe should keep in mind that all **Shadowrun** magic depends on the level of mana, a natural force that rises and falls in a cycle that lasts thousands of years. Currently, the universe's mana level is simply not high enough to power specialty magic items other than foci. Some day the mana level may rise high enough to power such items and make possible other unimaginable magical feats. Of course, mana is a mysterious and unknown force, so no one can truly predict what course it will take. That said, various **Shadowrun** books such as **Threats**, **Harlequin's Back** and **Awakenings** contain subtle hints and clues about the ebb and flow of mana, and interested players will find continuing clues to coming changes in future **Shadowrun** releases.

### INITIATION
Magical initiation (see The **Grimoire** and **Awakenings** sourcebooks) provides magical characters with access to new abilities and options such as metamagic, and gives them nearly unlimited potential to develop increasing amounts of power. The following options provide gamemasters with ways to control magical initiations in their games, and to make initiation more accessible to characters who are not well-acquainted with the complex rules of initiation and metamagic.

**Restricting Initiation**
Ideally, magical initiation represents a character's magical education and slow accumulation of wisdom. All too often, however, magician characters undergo initiation as soon as possible to reap the benefits it provides. In some campaigns, this may be acceptable and even desirable. Generally, however, a rash of "rampant initiations" can ruin the balance of a game. Gamemasters can restrict initiations in several ways. Most simply, gamemasters can prohibit player characters from using the Force Points from their allocated Resources to create starting-character initiates.

Alternatively, the gamemaster can require that a teacher, spirit-helper or magical group of some kind assist during the first Initiation of any character. By controlling the availability of suitable teachers, the gamemaster can control initiations in his campaigns. Additionally, the search for a suitable teacher can become an adventure goal and provide the character with a chance to earn some extra Karma toward initiation. Players may prefer this simple initiation restriction because it preserves most of their choices—once the character has achieved Initiate Grade Rating 0, he is free to self-initiate per standard rules. Gamemasters can also limit initiations by requiring that characters undergo ordeals for all initiations or when attempting to reach specific Grade Ratings (see pp. 39-41, **Grimoire** and pp. 113-14, **Awakenings** for ordeal rules). Ordeal requirements work especially well with the gradual initiation system described below.

**Gradual Initiation**
The knowledge and abilities provided by initiation represent a quantum leap in the development of a magician. Some gamemasters may prefer to change this vast leap into a series of short hops so that they can better control the abilities that a magician gains as he is initiated. Additionally, this system reduces the power gap between initiates and non-initiates. Under the gradual-initiation system, the magician does not gain access to all of the abilities of metamagic at once. Instead, the character starts out with a basic "package" of initiate abilities at Grade 0. Then, as the initiate achieves each successive Grade, he can learn one of the existing metamagical abilities. Thus, a magician will not know all of the metamagical abilities until he reaches Grade 6.

The Grade 0 "basic package" consists of all the "astral abilities" of initiation: an Astral Pool, a bonus to Astral Reaction and the ability to travel to the metaplanes (characters with astral projection only), along with all of the abilities associated with performing Astral Quests (see p. 93, **Grimoire**). The magician might then learn the metamagical abilities in the following order: Masking, Shielding, Centering, Dispelling, Quickening and Anchoring. Individual gamemasters can set the order in which the character learns the remaining metamagical abilities or simply allow characters to pick one ability per Grade. The order will have little effect on game balance, and different magical organizations are likely to teach the abilities in different sequences. Furthermore, letting characters select the order in which they will learn metamagic or setting different learning sequences for different characters will foster greater variety among initiates. Gamemasters can treat the additional metamagical abilities described in **Awakenings** (pp. 99-100) as parts of their "parent" metamagical skills or consider each additional ability separately for the purposes of acquiring metamagic. The gradual initiation system sharply limits the abilities of starting initiates and reduces Initiation to a valuable goal, rather than an amazing, unmanageable leap in knowledge. The gradual initiation system also increases the Karma costs of gaining new Grades, providing another option for controlling the amount of Karma in a game.

### UNPREDICTABLE HAZARDS OF MAGIC
Despite research on the nature of magic, it remains a sometimes fickle and unpredictable force in the twenty-first century. Though the various magical traditions possess techniques, rituals and spells that work well 99 percent of the time, no one truly understands how magic functions. Consequently, every now and then attempts to use magic result in unexplainable events that range from the humorous to the horrible—events that have given rise to numerous rumors of unlucky spellcasters being dragged screaming into some netherworld by demons or suffering from mental breakdowns because they saw Something Man Was Not Meant to Know.

Of course, the **Shadowrun** rulebook provides fairly comprehensive and specific rules about how magic works. The detailed nature of the game rules sometimes creates the impression that the inhabitants of the Sixth World also understand how magic works. The following rules are designed to correct that impression and provide gamemasters with a few ideas for keeping magic a wild, mysterious, unpredictable and dangerous phenomenon in their games.

**Magical Misfires**
The Rule of One (p. 32, SRII) is the simplest way to trigger magical misfires. Whenever a magician's Magical Skill Test yields all 1s, his use of magic creates some strange and unpredictable effect. Most magicians, however, have so many dice to throw around on their Magical Tests that a result of all 1s is exceedingly rare. Therefore, gamemasters may wish to employ the following Rule of One variant (first introduced in **Fields of Fire**). Under the Rule of One variant, a magical misfire occurs whenever the number of 1s rolled on a Magical Test equals or exceeds the base Skill or Force Rating used for the test. Thus, a magician who uses several bonus dice on a test increases the chance that his spell will misfire. A magician using a high Skill Rating and a spell with a high Force Rating decreases his chances of a misfire.

Bubba the mage decides to throw a Force 4 Fireball at the go-ganger trying to run him down. Bubba uses 6 dice from his Magic Pool on the test, which generates the following results: 10, 9, 7, 4, 4, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1. Bubba's spell misfires and toasts him where he stands.

Whenever a magical misfire occurs, the magical forces escape the magician's control and create an unpredictable effect. Gamemasters are encouraged to be creative and cruel—don't kill the character outright, but anything up to instant death is fair game. In the case of Bubba's mis-cast fireball spell, the misfire might set Bubba's clothes on fire, blow up any gas tank within 20 meters, summon a Force 4 fire elemental under nobody's control, surround the ganger in a temporary halo of fire or trigger any number of effects.

Any use of magic may cause a misfire. Misfires caused by Conjuring Tests tend to produce uncontrolled spirits, the wrong type of spirit, multiple spirits and manifestations of greater or lesser power than the caster intended. Some conjuring misfires have summoned hostile and dangerous spirits of a kind that no one has ever seen before. Enchanting Test misfires tend to create explosions, produce cursed or dangerous foci, trigger poltergeist phenomena and cause severe Drain on the spellcaster (treat as [Focus Rating]D Drain that causes Mental damage). Sorcery Test misfires are the most common type and may trigger virtually any kind of magical effect. Unlike normal failures under the Rule of One, magical misfires cannot be prevented by using a Karma Pool Point to re-roll a result of 1. A magician can spend 1 point of Good Karma to reduce the misfire to a normal failure per the standard rules.

**Variable Mana and Astral Conditions**
Like the physical world, astral space is not a uniform place. It contains "terrain" and astral conditions that vary widely from place to place and change with time. Some conditions may reduce the effects of magic, others may increase the effects of magic, and still others may cause magic to consistently produce unpredictable effects. Background count is one condition that affects how magic works in a specific location. Depending on the background count of an area, magic effects may be boosted or lowered. In some instances, the background count will affect only certain kinds of magic. (For further information on background counts, see p. 103, **Awakenings**.)

Other mana and astral conditions may vary according to time. Many magical traditions hold certain dates sacred. During these times, magical forces may become especially potent or weak—the background count or the rating of a power site or ley line may drop or rise dramatically. For example, during Halloween the barriers between the astral and physical world grow thin. Consequently, magicians working spells on Halloween night might find that nearly any place where people observe the holiday becomes a power site with a Rating of 1 or 2 (the exact rating is determined by how strongly the local inhabitants uphold the original tradition). Typically, such effects are strongest in areas where local inhabitants still observe the sacred times, or where the dates have been observed for long periods of history. Specific events might also cause a temporary background count (see p. 104, **Awakenings**) that fades as time passes. Gamemasters are encouraged to experiment with different magical conditions in different places and times throughout their campaigns. Furthermore, magician characters may make Magic Theory and Astral Perception Tests to learn more about local conditions before working any magic. Gamemasters set test target numbers, based on the character's background and the local conditions.

**Mana Surges**
Mana surges are like "storms" in astral space. These violent disturbances are rarer and infinitely more volatile than place- or time-based mana and astral variations, and they can cause the effects of magic to shift unpredictably. Mana surges seem to occur under certain rare conditions such as astrological conjunctions, but so far no one has created a reliable system for predicting the formations, locations or intensities of mana surges. A mana surge may affect an area ranging in size from a single city block to an entire country. Surges can last anywhere from a few minutes to a several weeks. No recorded mana surge has ever lasted longer than a lunar month (28 days). Individual gamemasters determine the affected areas and duration of mana surges in their campaigns.

During a surge, any magic cast in the area becomes difficult to control and results become unpredictable. In game terms, a surge may affect magic in two basic ways: It may cause a change in a spell's Force Rating and/or Drain Level or a change in the Force Rating of a summoned spirit.

* **Spell Casting Effects**: The gamemaster can simply choose an effect appropriate to his campaign or the character doing the casting, select an effect from the Mana Surge Spell Effects Table, or determine the effect by rolling 1D6 and consulting the Mana Surge Spell Effects Table.

| **MANA SURGE SPELL EFFECTS TABLE** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **First 1D6 Roll Result** | **Effect** |
| 1-2 | Roll 1D6, consult Force Decrease Table |
| 3-4 | Roll 1D6, consult Force Increase Table |
| 5-6 | Roll 1D6, consult Drain Change Table |

| **FORCE DECREASE TABLE** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Die Roll Result** | **Effect** |
| 1 or 6 | Force remains unchanged |
| 2 | Reduce Force by 1 |
| 3 | Reduce Force by 2 |
| 4 | Reduce Force by 3 |
| 5 | Reduce Force of spell by 1/2 |

| **FORCE INCREASE* TABLE** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Die Roll Result** | **Effect** |
| 1 or 6 | Force remains unchanged |
| 2 | Increase Force by 1 |
| 3 | Increase Force by 2 |
| 4 | Increase Force by 3 |
| 5 | Double Force |
| *All standard penalties for casting a spell greater than the caster's Magic Rating apply (see p. 128, SRII). | |

| **DRAIN CHANGE TABLE** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Die Roll Result** | **Effect** |
| 1 or 6 | Drain remains the same |
| 2 or 3 | Drain is staged up by 1 level |
| 4 or 5 | Drain is staged down by 1 level |

All tests for the affected spell are made using the Force of the spell as dictated by the two die rolls, with a minimum Force of 1. Keep in mind that a change to the Force of a spell will also affect its Drain. If a spell's Drain level is listed as Deadly and must be staged up, add 1 to the target number for the Drain Resistance Test, regardless of the Force of the spell. Stage Drain down as normal. A mana surge affects all spells cast in the physical or astral plane of the affected area, including spells cast for ritual magic. It does not affect the use of fetishes or foci. Metamagic also remains unaffected, as do the abilities of physical adepts. If desired, gamemasters may declare that mana surges increase or decrease the target numbers for ritual links.

* **Spirit Summoning Effects**: Conjuring in an area affected by a mana surge is risky because the spirit that responds may possess a Force Rating higher or lower than the summoner intended. The conjurer suffers Drain based on the Force of the spirit actually summoned, not the spirit that the conjurer intended to summon. The gamemaster can increase or decrease the summoned spirit's Force using the Force Increase and Force Decrease tables for mana surge spell effects. A spirit with a Force Rating higher than the summoner expected will remain to perform the requested service, but the gamemaster should make the spirit as Insubordinate and resentful as possible.

**Unknown Magic**
Magic breaks the rules—that's the one magic rule that gamemasters should always keep in mind. The standard **Shadowrun** magic rules describe the magic that player characters are able to use and control—the fairly commonplace and well-understood aspects of the mystic arts. But there is far, far more to magic than the people of the Sixth World have managed to learn. Consequently, sometimes magic acts in ways that nobody can explain, not even the best theoreticians. This gives the gamemaster the freedom to introduce whatever wizzer new magical things he or she wants to add to his or her campaign—without having to explain their existence or the way they work to the players. If you want to create a unique magical item that lets your players turn a group of Aztec blood mages to stone under the light of the full moon, that's cool. And if the players start to celebrate because they think they have a talisman they can use to turn all of their enemies to stone, gently remind them of the dangers of relying too heavily on unknown magical items before you let them find out for themselves that the talisman only works against magicians using blood magic under a full moon during the Hour of Mictlanteculti. In fact, that particular item might never work again. Why? Because it's magic.

By the same token, if you want some NPC to have a spell, ritual or magical item that is like nothing your player characters have ever seen, go right ahead. The Sixth World contains plenty of people who have access to magic that others may not understand. Some of the magical groups and entities from the **Threats** sourcebook, for example, have access to magic beyond most humans' ken, and it is said that madness carries with it insights into things that a sane person could never comprehend—so who knows what powers an insane magician might tap? If your players have decided that they know everything there is to know about how magic works, throw something at them to remind them that magic is a mysterious, unpredictable force far beyond their powers of comprehension.

### MAINTAINING THE MYSTERY OF MAGIC
Ideally, magic should be a rare and unusual phenomenon in the **Shadowrun** universe, and magically talented individuals should be a rare breed—"a mere 1 percent of the population," according to The **Grimoire** sourcebook. Yet in many **Shadowrun** games, "sometimes it seems like you can't swing a dead black cat without hitting a fraggin' magician," as the twenty-first-century anthropologist Mullins Chadwick observes. As a result, magic threatens to become anything but rare and unusual.

Fortunately, addressing this problem is fairly simple. First, gamemasters must understand that limiting the amount of magic in a campaign will make the magic that remains all the more impressive and unusual. Second, gamemasters must exercise a little restraint and resist the urge to incorporate all of their favorite magical phenomena into a single game session. These solutions do not address the need to create magical challenges to keep magical player characters occupied. Virtually every shadowrunning group contains at least one magician character, and the group's opponents will need to have some mojo to counter that character. The following section provides a few options that gamemasters can use to reduce the amount of magic they must introduce into a campaign to maintain game balance.

**Limits**
Limiting the number of player-character magicians is probably the simplest way to reduce magic use in a campaign. Limit shadowrunning teams to one magician each, and keep all magically talented characters rare in most games. If every player in a group wants to play a magician or adept, run a specialized campaign specifically designed to challenge their abilities (see Double, Double Toil and Trouble, p. 119).

**Magic Resistance**
Whenever possible and practical, use magic-resistant mundane opponents. The cybermantic characters described in the **Cybertechnology** sourcebook are a good (but rare) example of such opponents. Rigger-controlled drones, security 'bots, and guards hyped up on drugs to make them resistant to mana-type spells are other examples of potential magic-resistant mundane opponents.

**Background Count**
Make careful use of background counts and aspected magic areas (see p. 103, **Awakenings**). It seems highly likely that certain corps and powerful individuals purposefully cultivate high background counts in certain sites to deter magical opponents. The FAT bacteria mentioned in on page 82 of the **Corporate Security** sourcebook is one way corps might create such background counts, but even the daily activities of most corps can easily create low background counts.

**Critters**
Awakened critters are another excellent substitute for NPC magicians. Critters such as the dzoo-no-qua, which is very resistant to magic and quite a physical threat, makes an excellent choice for this purpose. Nimue's salamanders, which can drain or neutralize magic, make good adversaries as well. Remember that even the least intelligent dual critter can fight a spell cast at it in astral combat rather than make a simple Resistance Test.

**Mundane vs. Magician**
Instead of creating magician NPCs to oppose player character magicians, simply use large numbers of mundane NPCs to even the odds. For example, there's no reason a gamemaster must create a magical opponent to keep a street mage character busy—a dozen gangers will keep him occupied just as well. Countering a magical player character with large numbers of mundane NPCs can also be fun for the player character, because he can really let loose without worrying about Spell Defenses or magical counterattacks. Such confrontations can show just how tough magicians on all-out offense can be. Keep in mind that mundane opponents can be more than just "cannon fodder" for magician player characters. Most corporate security forces, for example, know enough about magic to limit the magician's line of sight. And nearly every NPC on the street knows enough to "geek the mage first" when the bullets and spells start flying.

### CREATING PRIME RUNNERS
Designing non-player character opponents that are powerful enough to genuinely threaten player characters yet vulnerable to defeat is one of the keys to running fun, engaging **Shadowrun** games. There is no way to create a single set of game statistics for such NPC opponents that will prove equally effective in all **Shadowrun** games, however, simply because the player characters in each individual game possess unique strengths and weaknesses. This section offers a method for creating the prime runners every shadowrunning team faces in the course of doing business. This system also allows gamemasters to tailor the powers of known runners such as Fastjack, Hatchetman, Argent, Magister and other published, high-profile runners to the level of their groups' teams, simply by deciding how a prime runner compares to the shadowrunners in the group.

The system provides frameworks for creating five broad types and ratings of NPC opponents: Inferior, Equal, Superior, Supreme and Superhuman. The description of each type suggests statistic levels for the NPC that are based on the statistics of the player characters the NPC will face. In other words, the gamemaster will tailor the NPC prime runners to accommodate the relative strength of the player characters. The description for each opponent level suggests a range of Threat Ratings. Varying the Threat Rating of each opponent and occasionally increasing or decreasing the Threat Rating during the course of a campaign helps keep players guessing about the actual power of their opponents. Each NPC opponent should also possess a Professional Rating (see p. 187, SRII) to determine how the NPC reacts in a fight. For example, an Inferior/Trained opponent (Professional Rating 3) may possess lower Skill Ratings and abilities than most player characters, but she will take a lot of abuse before giving up a fight. On the other hand, a Superior/Average (Professional Rating 1) opponent may be highly skilled but will have little stomach for battle. The following classifications may be useful for gamemasters creating Enemies (see p. 71).

**INFERIOR**
An NPC who is rated as Inferior to the player characters may still be a prime runner. Power and influence can be measured in many ways beyond strength, intelligence, nuyen, equipment, contacts and all the other ways runners rank themselves against their peers. For example, an opponent need hold only one item of information that the players would find inconvenient if it was revealed, and that NPC automatically ranks as a threat, even if that information is his or her only advantage.

Inferior NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 1-2 points lower than the Skill and Attribute Ratings of the average player character in a campaign. Under ideal conditions, a single player character is a match for 2-3 Inferior NPCs. Inferior characters may be very competent—they just aren't in the league of the player characters. Inferior characters have Threat Ratings from 1-2. At an appropriate moment during combat, the gamemaster may increase the NPC's Threat Rating to 3 to represent a one-time boost of energy (similar to a character's use of Karma dice).

**EQUAL**
An NPC who is rated Equal to the player characters possesses Skill and Attribute Ratings that are roughly equal to the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player characters in the campaign. These NPCs are the peers (and perhaps the rivals) of the campaign's player characters. They possess the same types of abilities and are capable of most of the same actions as the player characters. Depending on the general skill level and competence of the player characters, they may have many peers or very few. Gamemasters should play Equal NPCs with Dice Pools or Threat Ratings of 3-5. At an appropriate moment during combat, the gamemaster may increase the NPC's Threat Rating to 6 to represent a one-time boost of energy (similar to a character's use of Karma dice).

**SUPERIOR**
Superior NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 1-2 points higher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player characters in a campaign. Superior NPCs enjoy an edge in experience, talent or just plain luck that makes them better than their player-character counterparts. Consequently, a single Superior character is an even match for 2 player characters. Gamemasters may find it more effective to use Dice Pools to reflect the superior abilities of these NPCs. If he or she prefers to use a Threat Rating, the Threat Rating should equal the average of the shadowrunner teams' Dice Pools for the opponent's specialty. For example, a Superior street samurai would have a Threat Rating equal to the average of the Combat Pool Dice of the shadowrunner team. Because they wield far more power than Equal or Inferior NPCs, Superior NPCs should show up only rarely in campaigns.

**SUPERHUMAN**
Superhuman NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 3 or more points higher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player characters in a campaign. These NPCs are the best at what they do. They are the cream of the crop, legends of the streets, spoken of with respect and awe. These NPCs make good foils for reminding player characters of their own mortality and limits, or good adversaries for a group of very capable characters. Usually, a single Superhuman NPC provides an even match for an entire team of player characters. The Dice Pools (and Threat Ratings; see above) of Superhuman NPCs are 1-3 points higher than the average Dice Pools of the player characters. Add the Threat Rating to all tests the NPC makes.

**ULTIMATE**
The powers of Ultimate NPC opponents are off the scale. These opponents include great dragons, powerful spirits, ancient immortals, godlike Als and other entities that are so powerful they don't need game statistics. Gamemasters simply determine their exact powers to suit the current campaign and set an appropriate measurement to describe their characteristics as needed. Because Ultimate NPCs are so powerful, they function more like plot devices than standard NPC characters. Player characters might be able to thwart some of the plans and schemes of an Ultimate NPC, but no mortal has a prayer of surviving a direct confrontation with an Ultimate opponent. Use Ultimate NPC opponents very sparingly. They really don't need Dice Pools or Threat Ratings. Just keep rolling until they succeed—that's one of the reasons they are called Ultimate.

### STATE OF THE ART
The state-of-the-art (SOTA) rules provide game mechanics for simulating the steady advance of technology, the costs of keeping up with the latest technology and the disadvantages of not keeping up with technological innovations. In addition to helping the gamemaster convey the unstoppable rush of technological improvement that is an essential part of **Shadowrun**, the SOTA system provides a convenient way to reduce the amounts of nuyen and Good Karma characters possess and reduce overly powerful characters' skill and equipment ratings/bonuses.

While SOTA rules also apply to NPCs, gamemasters need not manage the details of every gamemaster character's relationship to the SOTA. He or she should simply keep in mind that the runners' opposition may also occasionally struggle to maintain the cutting edge and take care to not assume that all NPCs come equipped with the latest innovations and most recent discoveries in every field. The **Virtual Realities 2.0** sourcebook provides SOTA rules for deckers. The following SOTA rules apply to other areas of the **Shadowrun** universe. General rules regarding the use of SOTA are followed by rules for determining the field of SOTA advancement and specific rules for the effects of advancement in each field. Gamemasters can advance the SOTA in their campaigns after each adventure, once per game-year, or at any interval in between.

**LIFESTYLE COST REDUCTIONS**
To reflect the greater opportunities and advantages enjoyed by successful characters, any character who maintains a Luxury or High lifestyle receives an automatic SOTA cost reduction. A character with a Luxury lifestyle may reduce the final nuyen cost of a SOTA advance by 25 percent. A character with a High lifestyle may reduce the final nuyen cost of a SOTA advance by 10 percent.

**CYBERWARE COSTS**
The advent of beta and delta-grade cyberware has made alpha-grade cyberware far more available—but certainly not cheaper. To reflect this change, the Street Index and Availability for alpha-grade cyberware is now the same as for standard-grade cyberware. This means that players may choose alpha-grade cyberware for their characters during character creation. Because neither the Essence nor nuyen cost changed, however, the player must now decide whether to pay extra nuyen for the higher-grade cyberware, or to save on the Essence cost. (See the **Street Samurai Catalog** and **Cybertechnology** for rules and costs of alpha-grade cyberware.) Alpha and standard-grade cyberware is subject to the SOTA costs described in the various fields of SOTA advancement. Beta and delta-grade cyberware is immune to the SOTA—for now. Characters who use cheap or second-hand cyberware must increase the SOTA cost by 20 percent.

**FALLING BEHIND THE SOTA CURVE**
Any character who fails to pay the SOTA Factor cost of a SOTA advance suffers the penalties described. The character may reverse these penalties by paying the appropriate SOTA Factor cost any time before the next SOTA advancement in that field. If a character fails to pay the SOTA Factor cost for two consecutive SOTA advances in a field, she "falls behind the SOTA curve" and cannot reverse the penalty by simply paying the required costs. In addition to paying the required costs, the character must retrain in the affected field to regain the lost skill levels. Such training is subject to all the basic rules for skill upgrades and any rules the gamemaster wishes to apply from the Optional Training Rules section (p. 50).

**DETERMINING THE FIELD OF SOTA ADVANCEMENT**
To determine the field of SOTA advancement, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and consults the SOTA Table. The SOTA Advancements section describes the effects of the advancing state of the art in each field, the resulting SOTA Factor, and the penalties a character suffers if he does not pay the SOTA Factor. In addition to choosing the frequency of SOTA advances, gamemasters should customize the tables, adjust dice roll results, or otherwise alter the effects of SOTA advancements to better fit their own **Shadowrun** campaigns.

| **SOTA TABLE** | |
| :--- | :--- |
| **2D6 Roll Result** | **Field of Advancement** |
| 2 | Biotechnology |
| 3 | Vehicles/Rigger Technology |
| 4 | Matrix* |
| 5 | Personal Armor |
| 6-8 | NERPS |
| 9 | Reaction Enhancements |
| 10 | ECM and ECCM |
| 11 | Electronics |
| 12 | Magical Theory |
| *Gamemasters who prefer to calculate Matrix SOTA advances separate from the general SOTA system can simply replace the Matrix entry on the table with a second Vehicles/Rigger Technology entry. | |

**SOTA ADVANCEMENTS**

**Biotechnology**
SOTA advances in this field represent innovations in biotechnology and medical treatments designed to address the injuries and illnesses related to the ever-increasing amounts of new drugs, cyberware and biotech on the streets. Consequently, a character who does not keep up with biotechnology advancements will find it increasingly difficult to effectively treat injuries and diagnose disorders. The SOTA Factor for biotechnology advancements is equal to twice a character's original Biotech Skill Rating or twice the rating of his highest Biotech Concentration or Specialization, whichever is higher. Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 500 nuyen. (This means that when your medkit goes out-of-date, it's cheaper to buy a new one.) Characters may spend Good Karma to reduce this cost: each Karma Point spent reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point. (Biotechnology SOTA advances do not affect DocWagon contracts. Assume that DocWagon personnel automatically keep up with the SOTA.)

If a character does not pay the SOTA Factor, reduce by 1 point all of his Biotech Skill Ratings, including ratings for Biotech Concentrations or Specializations. The ratings of the character's Biotech expert systems, medkits and such are reduced by 1 point as well.

**Vehicles/Rigger Technology**
New cars with new gear have just hit the showroom floors (and the streets, of course). The gamemaster chooses which area of the field improves, the vehicle or the rigger gear. The SOTA Factor for a vehicle SOTA advancement is equal to twice the original rating of the improved piece of equipment. Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 1,000 nuyen. Characters can spend Good Karma to reduce the cost; each Karma Point spent reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point. If a character does not pay the SOTA Factor for an affected vehicle, reduce by 1 point one of the following ratings: Handling, Body, Armor or Pilot.

At the gamemaster's discretion, a vehicles/rigger technology SOTA advancement may occur in the area of vehicle-control rigs (VCRs) or rigger remote decks. The SOTA Factor for such advances is equal to 10 times the initial Reaction bonus provided by the cyberware (for example, 10 points for Level 1 VCRs and remote decks, 20 points for Level 2 items, and so on). Each SOTA point costs 1,000 nuyen. Characters can reduce the cost by spending Good Karma. Each Karma Point spent reduces the cost by 500 nuyen. Characters that fail to pay these SOTA costs lose 1 point of the Reaction bonus provided by the vehicle-control rig or remote deck.

**Matrix**
For rules on SOTA advances in cyberdecks, programs and other Matrix technology, see the Optional Rule: SOTA on page 78 of the **Virtual Realities 2.0** sourcebook.

**Personal Armor**
Yet another new method for making cheap armor-piercing ammunition has hit the streets. The SOTA Factor for this advance is equal to the Ballistic Armor Rating of each piece of armor a character owns. Each SOTA Factor point costs 500 nuyen. (Generally, this cost makes replacement much more cost-effective than upgrading, except for heavy combat armor.) Reduce by 1 point the Ballistic Armor Rating of all personal armor owned by a character who does not pay the SOTA cost.

**NERPS**
A SOTA advance in NERPS represents a new popular culture fad—anything from the new single by your favorite troll thrash band the Horns of Plenty to the new moving sidewalks in the Renraku Arcology. These advancements have no game effect.

**Reaction-Enhancing Cyberware**
Reaction-enhancing cyberware SOTA advances represent innovations in wired reflexes and other reaction-enhancing cyberware. The SOTA Factor for such advancements is equal to 10 times the initial Reaction bonus provided by the cyberware (20 points for Wired Reflexes (1), 40 points for Wired Reflexes (2), and so on). Each SOTA Factor point costs 1,000 nuyen. Characters can reduce the cost by spending Good Karma: each Karma Point spent reduces the cost by 5,000 nuyen. Double all SOTA costs for boosted reflexes; these systems can be tweaked but never properly upgraded. For characters who fail to pay the SOTA cost, reduce by 1 point the Reaction bonus provided by the affected cyberware. (For rules on VCRs and remote decks, see Vehicles/Rigger Technology, p. 86).

**ECM/ECCM**
The gamemaster can treat ECM (Electronic Countermeasures) and ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) advancements as separate events or assume that any ECM improvement is automatically followed by a corresponding ECCM advancement. For ECM SOTA advancements, the SOTA Factor is equal to 10 times the affected device's current rating. Each SOTA Factor point costs 1 percent of the device's initial cost. For example, a Rating 6 maglock passkey would have a SOTA Factor of 60: the cost to keep it up-to-date would be 60 percent of its Initial 60,000-nuyen cost, or 36,000 nuyen. For characters who do not pay the SOTA cost, reduce by 1 the rating of any affected maglock key or electronic surveillance device (dataline taps, codebreakers, Scramble-breakers, signal locators, and so on). Similarly, reduce by 1 the ECM rating of any affected vehicle or equipment.

For ECCM SOTA advancements, the SOTA Factor is equal to 10 times the affected device's current rating. Each SOTA Factor point costs 1 percent of the device's initial cost. For characters who do not pay the SOTA cost, reduce by 1 the rating of any affected maglock and electronic surveillance countermeasure (bug scanners, Crypto Circuits, data-encryption systems, and so on). Similarly, reduce by 1 the ECCM rating of any affected vehicle or piece of equipment.

**Electronics**
Electronics SOTA advances represent breakthroughs in circuit design or other innovations in electronics technology. The SOTA Factor for such advances is equal to twice a character's Electronics Skill Rating or twice the rating of the character's highest Electronics Concentration or Specialization, whichever is higher. Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 500 nuyen. Characters can spend Good Karma to defray this cost; each Karma Point spent reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point. Reduce by 1 point the Electronics Skill Rating of any character who fails to pay the SOTA cost.

**Magical Theory/Practice**
Magical theory SOTA advances represent new magical research findings that substantially revise magical theory. The SOTA Factor of such advances is equal to twice a character's Magical Theory Skill Rating or the rating of his highest Magical Theory Concentration or Specialization, whichever is higher. Each SOTA Factor point costs 500 nuyen. Characters may spend Good Karma to reduce this cost. For each Karma Point spent, reduce the SOTA Factor by 1 point. Reduce by 1 point the Magical Theory Skill Rating of any character who fails to pay the cost. The SOTA Factor for a Hermetic Library is equal to twice the library's rating. For disk-based libraries, each SOTA Factor point costs 100 nuyen. For chip-based libraries, each point costs 120 nuyen, for hard-copy libraries, 200 nuyen. Reduce by 1 point the rating of a Hermetic Library of any character who fails to pay the SOTA cost.

**ROLEPLAYING THE SOTA**
The SOTA system also provides new roleplaying opportunities. For starters, gamemasters can inform players of a new SOTA advance in several ways—talk on Shadowland, a chance meeting with a contact who gives them the latest buzz, an eye-opening fight with a razorboy equipped with the new SOTA wired reflexes, and so on. Next, gamemasters can require that player characters do more than simply spend some nuyen to keep up with SOTA advances. Tracking down a new piece of hardware, finding someone who can teach the latest skill advances, or scamming a copy of the newest cutting-edge software are just a few examples of tasks that characters might have to perform to keep up. Additionally, gamemasters can consider SOTA Factor costs part of the resources—time, information, tools, equipment and so on—characters must spend to keep up with a SOTA advancement.

**DEAD-END TECH OPTION**
The dead-end tech option provides a way for particularly cold-hearted gamemasters to inflict additional SOTA penalties on player characters. Under the dead-end tech option, the gamemaster can decide that characters must select between two or more upgrade options to keep up with a particular SOTA advance. (These competing upgrade options represent competing product lines manufactured by rival corporations.) At the gamemaster's discretion, any time a SOTA advance occurs in that field, one of the competing product lines may collapse. Characters who used the defunct product line must then pay double the standard SOTA Factor cost to maintain their ratings—which means re-training and big nuyen.

### RETIREMENT
Most runners don't retire until shortly after they die. However, the lucky few who retire before they meet an unfortunate end will likely have contacts, skills and resources that make them valuable to the shadowrunning community. Characters may retire for many reasons. Perhaps the player is simply tired of playing that character; maybe the gamemaster decides that a character has become too powerful or will not be able to play a useful role in the current campaign; perhaps the gamemaster and player initially agreed that the character would die at the end of a specific story line, but at the moment of truth neither really wants to let the character disappear from the game completely. In this case, the player may agree to hand over control of the character to the gamemaster, and the character may take on a completely new life as a friend or foe of the shadowrunner team.

Depending on the circumstances of their leaving the team, ex-runners may stand willing and ready to help their former teammates whenever and in whatever way is needed at a moments' notice. As a fixer or a Mr. Johnson, the character may serve as the team's primary resource for work, or may simply be a constant, inexpensive source of information and contacts. A character who chooses not to pursue a second career and decides to simply live on his or her savings may be persuaded to come out of retirement for "one more big score" or to get his old team out of a jam, especially if the team made very powerful enemies before the player character left ("Remember that comm line we tapped back in '55? Unfortunately for us, it turns out that that was Lofwyr's private LTG. He'd like us to come to a meet and discuss the consequences of our actions...").

On the other hand, they may actively seek to aid the team's enemies and bring down their former chummers. An ex-runner may have been an agent of a team's enemy working from the inside, or some sort of misunderstanding might have turned the character against the team, leaving him or her ripe for recruitment by the enemy. In the best tradition of the spy genre (and **Shadowrun**, for that matter), gamemasters may spin a complex web of deceit, betrayal, double- or triple-crosses, regret and revenge that keeps the former player character involved in the campaign in newly sinister and morally complicated ways.

Retired runners can remain active in a campaign in several ways. Some may simply step back from the front lines and operate behind the scenes in relative safety. Others may come out of the shadows completely and put their experience to work in the civilian or corporate worlds. The following section offers some ideas for roles that retired runners can play in a campaign. Regardless of the role a retired character assumes, all retired characters act as Level 3 contacts for their former teammates. Additionally, an ex-runner's contacts can serve as friends-of-a-friend for all team members. (See Friends of a Friend, p. 63, for more information about FOFs).

### SECOND CAREERS
Ex-shadowrunners often have a wide variety of skills that enable them to earn a living in numerous ways. Some of the less traditional choices for a second career include: urban brawl player or combat-biker, Matrix consultant, Doc Wagon employee, magical researcher, street doc, military advisor, talismonger, corporate wage slave and simsense star (an ever-popular choice). Ex-runners may also choose second careers more closely related to the work they did as shadowrunners.

**"Hello. I'm Mr. Johnson."**
Usually, former shadowrunners are well-suited to act as "Mr. Johnsons." Typically, a former runner is intimately familiar with how a shadowrun is orchestrated, which can give such a character valuable insight into the potential risks and profits of a run. Ex-runners are also likely to know at least some of the shadowrunners operating in an area and be better able to pick the right people for a job. But perhaps most important, most shadowrunners will be more likely to trust an ex-runner rather than a Johnson who has spent his career behind a desk. The same characteristics also make ex-runners well-suited to act as "talent agents" for shadowrunning teams. A character serving as an agent actively searches out the most lucrative jobs for her team and takes a percentage of the profits in return. If an ex-runner character doesn't have a total of 6 contacts, the gamemaster and former controlling player can select additional contacts to bring the number to 6.

**"I Got What You're Looking For"**
Any runner character who retires with some money may set himself up as a fixer. A former shadowrunner would likely have the contacts needed to obtain hard-to-find pieces of equipment and to fence the kind of drek-hot paydata and trinkets that runners tend to collect. Furthermore, most retired runners have dealt with fixers often and are fairly familiar with that aspect of the business. As a sideline, many fixers also arrange runners for independent shadowruns or act as intermediaries between corporations and runners. Such activities are practically required for fixers who deal primarily in information. Any former runner who sets up shop as a fixer may select contacts to bring his total number of contacts to 6. Fixers tend to specialize, so players may wish to select contacts that reflect the character's specialty.

**"I Know How These Scum Operate"**
Sometimes it takes a rat to catch a rat. Corporations recognize this fact, and often hire former shadowrunners to work as corporate security specialists, trainers, guards, security deckers and so on. Some ex-runners even set up their own private security consulting firms and sell their services to the corporations they used to run against.

**"Hey, I'm Clean"**
Any ex-runner who retires with a bit of cash can set up a "legitimate" business. (Some characters may even open a shop before they retire, though this involves a much greater risk in the event that their cover is blown.) Every legal business owner must have a SIN (even if it's just a counterfeit one), as well as the proper permits and registrations. Some popular businesses for ex-shadowrunners include weapons stores (for former street sams and mercs), talismonger shops (for former magicians), electronics/computer stores (for ex-deckers) and vehicle repair (for former riggers).

Opening any business requires an initial investment. The entrepreneur must buy base inventory and purchase or lease any required facilities. For most businesses, these costs can be determined by using the equipment and working gear costs listed in the gear tables at the end of **SRII**. Keep in mind that a character making legal purchases need not worry about the Street Index of legal items, facilities or shops. Business and operating permits can cost anywhere from 100 to 1,000 nuyen or more, depending on the type of business—for example, a permit for a registered security agency will cost considerably more than a permit for a talismonger shop or a courier business. Individual gamemasters may set permit costs in their campaigns. Finally, keep in mind that a "legitimate" business owner need not restrict herself to legal means to operate her business. "Hot" merchandise and alternative funding sources (loan sharks, bank heists and so on) are just two shady practices that may spell instant success (or eventual ruin) for a would-be business owner.

### DEFECTING TEAM MEMBERS
According to the standard rules, a group's Team Karma Pool is reduced by half whenever a character leaves a group (see p. 191, SRII). Consequently, team members may put pressure on their fellow player characters to remain on their team, and players may be reluctant to stop playing their characters for fear of putting the remaining team members at a severe disadvantage. To lessen these pressures and make retirement a more desirable option for player characters, gamemasters may waive this Team Karma penalty when a character leaves a group on good terms. Instead, divide the total Team Karma Pool by the number of team members (round up) to determine each member's "share" of the Team Karma Pool. When a player leaves, simply reduce the Team Karma Pool by his share. The defecting player does not receive the Karma Points—they are simply gone. If a player leaves a team on bad or indifferent terms, reduce the Team Karma Pool by half, per standard rules. If a character ever wishes to return to a former team, he must contribute Karma to the Team Karma Pool according to the standard rules for a new member of the group before he can use that Karma Pool.

### INTEGRATING NEW TEAM MEMBERS
Few gaming groups are willing to start a new campaign just to add a new player or player character. Every time a new player wants to join the game, however, or a new player character needs to join the team because a former character retired or died or because the team is lacking a necessary skill, the group must find a way to successfully integrate new characters into the existing shadowrunning team. Using the team's contacts is perhaps the simplest way to introduce new characters to a group. A contact may introduce a new character at virtually any time and place. Following the contact's introduction of a new character or in place of it, a team might hold a "trial run" to test prospective team members. Gamemasters can easily fill such runs with interesting and fun surprises, because the prospective member and the team will be unfamiliar with each other's skills, abilities, work methods, personalities and so on. Finally, a chance encounter may bring a new character and a group together. Gamemasters can use nearly any element already present in their campaigns—Edges and Flaws, training, background stories, common enemies—to get a new player onto an existing shadowrunning team.
