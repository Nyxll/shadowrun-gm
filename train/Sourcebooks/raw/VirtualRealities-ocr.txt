Since Shadowrun first appeared in 1989
players and
gamemasters have sent us megapulses of invaluable feed
back on the game system. Much of that feedback included
concerns about the complexity of Shadowrun's Matrix game
mechanics and the sheer amount of playing time needed to
create and map Matrix systems, build and upgrade
cyberdecks, and conduct runs in the Matrix. Virtual Realities
2.0 (VR 2.0), the new Matrix sourcebook for Shadowrun.
Second Edition (SRII), takes a fresh look at cyberspace and
addresses these concerns.
VR 2.0 provides new, streamlined rules for mapping
Matrix systems, building and upgrading decks, conducting
cybercombat. IC, utility programs-everything Involved in
making a Matrix run. In addition, VR 2.0 provides entirely
new software, programming tricks, and damage rules, and
adds rules for creating and playing the mysterious otaku, the

The human mind cannot directly comprehend the flow of
data In the Matrix, If users were restricted to old-tech tools-
command lines, file names, programs in clumsy procedural lan-
guages-the system would be unmanageable. For example, a
user who wanted to read a computer file in 1995 would type in
some wearisome command, find the file in a window, or access
the desired information in some other, equally clumsy method.
But after the Crash of 2029. ASIST technology opened up the
possibilities of actual DNI (Direct Neural Interface) access to com-
puters, and the Matrix was born, Now, the user takes a microsec-
ond-long trip through a computer-generated landscape In order
to find a file. If the user Is validated to see a file, he finds it right
where he expects to find it. The interface routines he uses may
look like clerical workers, or a huge library, or simply appear as
dazzling patterns of energy. The user sees the file, touches it, and
the data downloads into his cyberterminal.
Users do not need to remember codes, command sets, or
file names. If they want something, they go get it. If they want
to program a process for the laboratory or an assembly line, they
mentally perform the motions involved or build a model using
virtual components, and the computer learns from them.
Modern chemists, for example, build molecules according to for-
mulae as if they were using children's building blocks. The com-
puter then translates these actions into a program that will oper-
ate the process in the real world.
Legitimate users have registered cyberterminals that identi-
fy themselves to the Matrix at every step. But the cyberdecks of
deckers have no Matrix Identifiers. Deckers remain anonymous,
and when everything goes right they can dance through the
secrets of the Matrix, laughing at security measures. Of course.
when things go wrong, they can die in the Matrix as well.
These concepts remain unchanged from those presented in
the basic Shadowrun rules. However, Virtual Realities 2.0 offers
new game mechanics to simulate these concepts. The most
important new game mechanics are system operations and
System Tests. A system operation is simply a list of the game
information a decker needs to perform a task in the Matrix. Each
system operation lists the System Test(s) required to perform the
chosen task. the name of any utility programs that augment the
test, the type of action the decker has to expend to perform the
task, and a description of what happens when he attempts to do
so. (Several pre designed system operations appear in the sec .:
tion titled System Operations. p. 108. A quick reference list of
operations also appears in the Appendix. p. 162.)
Under the revised Matrix 2.0 rules, a System Test consists of
an opposed test between the decker and the system he is infil-
trating (note that the term System Test is used differently than In
the Matrix 1.0 rules). The decker makes an appropriate
Subsystem Test. The gamemaster makes a Security Test for the
system against the deckers Detection Factor.
This section provides an overview of these and other new
game mechanics presented in Matrix 2:0. Subsequent sections
provide more detailed instructions for using these new rules.
Icons
Every object a user sees in the Matrix is an icon. Users have
special icons called personas. When we talk about a decker's per-
sona, we may also refer to his icon. or his online icon.
As real as the experience seems, a decker never physically
enters the Matrix, His mearbod remains sitting where the
cyberdeck connects to the Matrix, the jackpoint. The deck feeds
the decker an ASIST signal, in the same way as a simsense set,
that makes him think he is somewhere else. That somewhere
else is the Matrix.
The persona programs and utilities running on the
cyberdeck are master copies of the software that makes decking
possible. When a decker logs on to a grid or host, the cyberdeck
locs versions of those programs into the Matrix system. In a
nutshell, deckers deal with two sets of programs: the front-end
programs on the deck, which convert the decker's neural Impuls-
es into computer command transactions: and server programs in
the Matrix, which convert those commands into programming
commands that influence what the system does.
These online servers form the decker's persona. Through the
persona, the decker experiences the environment of the system
where he is active. The persona programs send transactions back
from the Matrix to the cyberdeck, where the front-end programs
convert them Into simsense experiences.
This system creates two complexes: the meat decker and his
front-end programs on the deck; and the deckers online icon.
which runs on the computers that create the Matrix, Disconnect
the deck, crash the persona, or sever the commlink that connects
them, and the decker is offline, jacked our, dumped.
GRIDS AND HOSTS
The Matrix consists of telecommunications networks (grids)
and computer systems (hosts). Grids carry voice and data trans-
missions-everything from local phone calls to gigapulse data
packets. Hosts are what used to be called mainframe computers.
but mainframes in the Sixth World do not have to be single,
powerful pieces of hardware. In fact, many of them are linked
series of massive parallel processors in smaller configurations
These provide just as much jam as a single supercomputer.
Simply put, a host in Shadowrun is any computer important
enough for a decker to invade and tough enough to fight back.
MATRIX TOPOLOGY
The connections between grids and hosts define the basic
topology of the Matrix. Only four types of connections exist-
open-access, tiered access, host host access, and private grid.
access connections. Bur multiply those connections by millions of
hosts, criss-crossing through the guds, and you end up with a
network so complex only a decker could love it!

Open Access
Most computer systems use the open-access connection.
Quite simply, any host connected directly to a grid has an open-
access connection. Any user, anywhere in the world, can use the
public grids to access such hosts. All four of the Hosts in the
Open Access Diagram are attached to the same LTG (Local
Telecommunications Grid). A decker can access any of them by
connecting to that LTG. If he is already logged on to one host, he
can disconnect from that host and access another host without
terminating his Matrix run.
Host B
Host A

LTG
Tiered Access
In the Tiered Access Diagram, only Host A is connected direct-
ly to the grid. Hosts B, C, and D are connected only to Host A. In
this arrangement. Host A functions as a first-tier system; Hosts B. C.
and D function as second-tier systems. Any user who wants to
access Hosts B. C, or D must first pass through Host A. To get from
Host B to Host C or D, the decker must re-enter Host A.
First-tier systems can be designed to act as switchers, pass-
ing authorized users Into second-tier hosts. Or first-tier systems
may allow users to pass to a private local telecommunications
grid (PLTG) that provides access to second-tier systems.
The classic Matrix security concept called chokepoint design
is a specific application of tiered access. In chokepoint systems.
the first-tier hosts carry as vicious security as is possible, with the
second-tier hosts running relatively lower security.

Host . Host Access
A host-host access configuration consists of a set of hosts
linked directly to one another. No single host defends the others.
All perform specific jobs but must share data to do so. In Matrix
1.0, such a system would have been mapped as a series of SANS
shared by multiple CPUs, or maybe just a lot of SPUIs under a
powerful CPU
Host-host configurations commonly appear in corporate
schemas. Typically, only a few hosts connect directly to public
grids, but numerous machines in the second tier of the system
are linked to each other. Deckers can only access hosts through
other computers that are linked to them. For example, a decker
in the LTG of the system in the Host-Host Diagram would have
to pass through Hosts B and D or through Hosts B. C and D to
reach Host E.

Private Grid Access
A private grid (PLTG) represents a proprietary communica-
tions network inhabited solely by the hosts of a given corpora-
lian, government, or consortium. These can range from small,
local networks called LANs (Local Area Networks) to global
PLTGs. Once a decker has accessed any host in a private grid. he
can access any other host connected to that grid.
Within a PLTG, hosts may be organized In tiered or host-
host access configurations-and are. In the Sixth World, para-
noia is not a pathology for Matrix-security designers. It's a
requirement.

Hosts section, p. 14.

SYSTEM RATINGS
The Matrix 1.0 rules forced gamemasters to map out each
host in detail, creating different ratings for each system node. In
Matrix 2.0, every system, whether a grid or a host, has a Security
Rating and five subsystem ratings -- Access, Control, Index, Files
and Slave; In Matrix 2.0. these ratings are collectively known as
the System Rating (note that this use of the term is completely
different from the definition of System Rating in the original
Matrix rules:)
See Grids and Hosts, p. 14. for rules for determining
System Ratings.
SECURITY RATING
A Security Rating consists of a security code (a color) and a
Security Value (a number). (The Security Value is called the
System Rating in the SRII rulebook.)
The four security codes are Blue (little or no security), Green
(average security); Orange (significant security), and Red (high
security). Reportedly, some systems contain killer defenses that
send their security codes right off the 'official' color scale. Decker
slang calls these Ultra-Violet. UV, or black systems. The security
environments of UV hosts are qualitatively different from those
of other hosts. (See Grids and Hosts, p. 14, for more information
on UV hosts.)
Generally, Security Values range from 4 to 12, though they
sometimes range higher. Double-digit values represent extreme
system security. The Security Value indicates the number of dice
the gamemaster rolls to oppose a deckers system tests.
SUBSYSTEM RATINGS
The five subsystem ratings-Access, Control, Index. Files,
and Slave-represent the resistance of a system's subsystems to
unauthorized manipulations by a decker. These ratings function
as target numbers for all the tests a decker makes when attempt-
ing to manipulate the system illegally. For example, an unauthor
rized decker trying to read files on a system would use his
Computer Skill to make an Access Test and a Files Test. The
Access Test, made against the system's Access Rating, gets the
decker Into the host or grid. The Files Test, made against the sys-
tem's File Rating, enables him to read the files themselves. (See
Systems Tests. p. 19, for further information on Systems Tests.)
Keep in mind that a high subsystem rating does not impede
authorized users from using the subsystem. For example, a high
Access Rating does not affect the log-on procedures of authorized
users. It simply makes illegal log-on attempts more difficult .:
Access Rating
The Access Rating measures a system's resistance to unau-
thorized access. To access a grid, an unauthorized decker must
make a successful Access Test against the grid's Access Rating.
To log on to a host without a valid passcode, a decker must make
a successful Access Test against the host's Access Rating.
Control Rating
The Control Rating measures a system's resistance to unau-
thorized administrative commands, For example, an unautho-
tized decker attempting to kick a legitimate user off a host must
make a successful Control Test against the host's Control Rating.
Generally, successful Control Tests will enable deckers to repro-
gram a system or defeat its security measures.
Index Rating
The Index Rating measures a system's resistance to unau-
thorized searches. An unauthorized decker searching a grid or
host for a system address or specific file must make an Index Test
against the grid/host's Index Rating
Files Rating
Deckers must make Files Tests against the Files Ratings when-
ever they attempt to Illegally read or write datafiles in a system.
Deckers must also make Files Tests to decrypt encoded files and
send output to devices such as faxprinters or chip cookers.
Slave Rating
The Slave Rating governs the operation of remote devices
controlled by a system. For example, a successful Slave Test
enables an unauthorized decker to take control of devices
manipulated by a host, such as security cameras and elevators,
RATING FORMAT
Matrix 2.0 describes System Ratings using the following
shorthand format:
Security Code-Security Value/Access/Control/Index/Files/Slave
For example, a Red-6 system with Access and Index Ratings of
10. a Control Rating of 12, and Files and Slave Ratings equal to 9
would be written:
Red-6/10/12/10/9/9
The acronym "ACIFS-Access Control Index Files Slave-
may make remembering this format easier. The gamemaster may
also create a simplified format by eliminating the Files and Slave
ratings. Generally, Index, Files and Slave Ratings do not differ
greatly, so the gamemaster may simply average the three val-
ues, rounding fractions down. In this simplified format. the
example above would become:
Red-6/10/12/9
A System Design Sheet for recording further details of a sys-
tem appears in the Appendix, p. 156.

DECK RATINGS
The power of a deckers persona is defined by the process
ing power of his deck's MPCP (Master Persona Control Program),
and his bod, sensor, evasion, and masking utility programs, The
MPCP represents the master operating system for the deck and
has an MPCP Rating that measures its ability to take damage and
continue functioning. The bod, sensor, evasion, and masking
programs are called persona programs. The numeric ratings of
these programs serve as the 'attributes" for the decker's persona
and are used whenever tests are made against the decker while
In the Matrix, Deckers also use utility programs, rated in the
same manner.
The MPCP Rating is the central value for cyberdecks. The
MPCP Rating multiplied by 3 equals the maximum total of the
deck's persona programs. No single Persona Rating may exceed
the MPCP Rating, and the maximum value for most utility pro-
grams is equal to the MPCP Rating.
The shorthand format for describing a cyberdeck's ratings is:
MPCP Rating/Bod Rating/Evasion Rating/Masking Rating/Sensor
Rating
A deck with MPCP-8 and all Persona programs distributed equally
among the maximum total (3 x 8 - 24), would be written as follows:
MPCP-8/6/6/6/6
If the decker increased his Bod Rating by 2 points, to the maxi-
mum of 8, he'd have to reduce the other Persona programs by a
total of Z. If he decided to reduce his Evasion and Sensor ratings
by I each, the deck's ratings would be written
MPCP-8/8/5/6/5
All of these programs are discussed in more detail in the
Deckers, Cyberdecks, and Programs sections.
DETECTION FACTOR
The gamemaster uses the decker's Detection Factor as the
target number when making tests to detect a decker's presence
or prevent a decker from performing actions within the Matrix
(see System Tests, p. 19). To determine the decker's Detection
Factor, calculate the average (round up) of the decker's Masking

Rating and Sleaze program rating. For example, an MPCP-
8/6/8/6/4 deck, running a Sleaze-8 program, would have a
Detection Factor of 7. That's [6 (Masking) + 8 (Sleaze Rating)
[4] divided by 2 - 7.
Ilt a decker is not running a Sleaze program, the Detection
Factor equals half the Masking Rating, This makes a drek-hot
Sleaze program a necessity for any decker with aspirations, not
to mention a keen sense of self-preservation.
THE HACHING POOL
The Matrix 2.0 system creates a much smaller Hacking Pool
than Matrix 1.0. To determine a deckers Matrix 2:0 Hacking
Pool, add the deckers Intelligence Rating and his deck's MPCP
Rating, divide the total by 3 and round down. (Any increases of
a decker's Intelligence apply to his Hacking Pool as well, whether
they come from cyberware or magic. Increases are cumulative
unless the gamemaster chooses to use the optional Multiple
Improvements rule provided on p. 19.) The final figure is the
Matrix 2.0 Hacking Pool.
Generally, Hacking Pool dice may be added to any test made
In the Matrix-System Tests, attack of defense tests, maneuvers,
programming, or attribute tests. However, characters may not use
Hacking Pool dice in the following circumstances
First, dice from the Hacking Pool cannot enhance Initiative
rolls or doctrinal dice rolls such as 'roll ID6 to see how long it
will be before the host crashes." Those are not tests In the
Shadowrun sense of a dice roll against a target number.
Additionally, Hacking Pool dice cannot be used in Body of
Willpower tests made to resist the effects of gray or black IC that
Is damaging the decker. Only Karma Pool dice, enhancements
connected to the cyberdeck, or bloware/magic boosts to the
decker's Body or Willpower can help In such situations.

Cyberware and the Pool
Any cybertech item from Shadowrun, Second Edition;
Shadowtech; or Cybertechnology that raises Intelligence may
affect the Hacking Pool, as noted above, Two specific examples
of such Items: often employed by wiz deckers. require special
comment. These are encephalon implants and the Math SPU (see
Shadowtech, pp. 49 and 52)
Encephalon implants improve Intelligence, and this bonus fig-
ures into the calculation of the Hacking Pool. In addition,
encephalons provide Task Pool dice for certain activities. If the
decker has slotted a Computer skillsoft with a rating equal to or
greater than his own skill, or if he only uses the skill granted by the
skillsoft, the Task Pool dice also go into the Hacking Pool. Note that
skillwires are not required to use a Computer activesoft for deck-
ing if the decker uses an encephalon implant. However, skillwires
are required to use the skillsoft without an encephalon implant.
A Math SPU increases a character's Intelligence by half its
rating for purposes of decking. For example, a Math SPU of
Rating 4 offers a substantial bonus to the decker's Hacking Pool.
especially if he does not have a million nuyen to buy compo-
nents to build a drek-hot cyberdeck. For 23,000 nuyen and a tri-
fling Essence cost, it represents an excellent investment.
Optional Rule: Multiple Improvements
The optional multiple improvements rule may be used to
prevent players from using magical and cybernetic Intelligence
bonuses to produce 'superdecker' characters who possess
excessive Hacking Pools. Under this rule, the character may
apply only one Intelligence bonus to the Hacking Pool. Use the
highest bonus or allow the player to choose which enhancement
applies to the pool. Generally, an encephalon Implant represents
the best choice, because its Task Pool dice directly enhance the
Hacking Pool.
The multiple improvements rule prevents players from cre-
ating superdeckers who buy every last advantage they can get in
cyberware and have a friendly mage with that Increase Attribute
spell constantly on tap. It forces the decker to get his extra edge
from superior decks and utilities, which will result in characters
who are extremely hungry for cash. especially if the gamemaster
employs the SOTA rules (see Deckers, p. 74). This need for cash
also provides a weakness gamemasters may exploit when luring
players into scripted adventures.
SYSTEM TESTS
As noted in the section Introduction, unauthorized deckers
must make System Tests whenever they attempt to perform
tasks within the Matrix. System Tests are always resolved as
opposed tests between the decker and the target host/grid. The
decker uses his Computing skill to make the Subsystem Test
appropriate to the task he is attempting. For example, logging
on to a host requires an Access Test against the system's Access
Rating. Editing a file on that host requires a Files Test, and so on.
The target number for these tests is modified by any utility pro-
grams the decker is running and any appropriate situation mod-
ifiers (system alert levels, damaged decker or deck, and so on).
For the opposed test, the gamemaster rolls the host/grid's
Security Value (on a Red-6 host, that would be 6 dice) against the
decker's Detection Factor. Apply any appropriate situation mod-
ifiers to the Detection Factor.
The following example illustrates the first step any decker is going
to take; getting into the host within which he wants to operate.
HeadCrash has Computing-6 and an MPCP-8/6/6/6/6
deck. He is running Sleaze-5, so his Detection Factor is 6
(6 + 5 = 11, divided by 2 = 5.5, rounded up). He is also run-
ning Deception-4. Head is decking into a Red-8 host with
Access-11. He needs to make an Access Test to log on.
HeadCrash rolls 6 dice, his Computing skill. The target
number is: 11 (Access Rating) minus 4 (Deception Rating),
for a final Access Test Target Number of 7.
The gamemaster rolls 8 dice, the host's Security Value,
against a Target Number 6. Head's Detection Factor.
HeadCrash achieves results of 2,2,3,4,5,9, for one suc-
cess against the Target Number of 7. The host achieves
results of 1,2,2,2,3,3,5,5-no successes. HeadCrash logs
on to the host. He got lucky, and he'd better hope his luck
holds.
Note that had HeadCrash not been running the Deception
program, his Target Number would have been 11 rather than
7. He'd have had no successes, and would have failed to log
on. Moral: you can't do anything unless you can get into a
host in the first place, so a good Deception program is a must
for any decker interested in hosts with high security levels.
If the decker achieves more successes than the host, he wins
the test and succeeds at whatever task he is attempting to per-
form. If the host achieves more successes, the decker fails.
Regardless of the test outcome, the gamemaster records the
host's number of successes and adds the total to any previous
successes the host achieved in System Tests against the decker.
This running total creates the security tally.
SECURITY TALLY
The gamemaster tallies all the successes a host/grid
achieves while opposing a decker in System Tests. This tally runs
as long as the decker is logged on to that particular host/grid.
When the tally reaches a level set by the gamemaster, It may
trigger actions within the host/grid, determined by the
gamemaster and ranging from the activation of black IC pror
grams to nothing at all. The bottom line is that decker never
knows what will happen as a result of his next test, or how many
more tests he can safely afford before the host/grid catches on
to his presence and does its best to crash him.
More details on security tallies and how to use them appear
In the gamemaster-only section Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149. The
system sheaves (archetypes for a Matrix system) provided in that
section define the reaction of a host/grid to intruders: slow and
cautious, or fast and lethal.

GRIDS
The term grid is often used as a synonym for the Matrix, but
in Matrix 2.0 the term denotes a telecommunications net-in
other words, the phone company. The situation in 2056 can be
traced back to the years following the Crash of 29, when most
developed nations returned to massive, single-vendor monopo-
lies for their common-carrier communications. This arrangement
was intended to prevent another Crash, of course, not to satisfy
the demands of the megacorps, control citizens" access to data,
or anything like that.
National grids consist of one or more Regional
Telecommunications Grids (RTG), owned and maintained by a
monopoly vendor. An RTG usually encompasses many dependent
Local Telecommunications Grids (LTG). LTGs are analogous to the
area codes of 20th-century communication networks and are main-
tained by local subsidiaries or franchises of the parent company.
REGIONAL TELECOMMUNICATION GRIDS [RTG]
The topology of the North American RTGs appears on p.
164, SRII. The Matrix 2.0 System Ratings for these RTGs are
listed In the North American RTG System Ratings table. The
Overseas RTG System Ratings table provides Matrix 2.0 System
Ratings for overseas RTGs, Because public grids carry such
enormous volumes of traffic and possess relatively few securi-
ty resources, these ratings are lower than those of a typical host
computer.
When generating System Ratings for a public grid not on the
list, assume the grid has an Intrusion Difficulty of Easy and sub-
tract 2 from all ratings (for a range of 6 to 8), See Intrusion
Difficulty, p. 31. for details on generating ratings.
To minimize the impact of the Matrix 2.0 upgrade on previ-
ously published Shadowrun materials, the grids retain their orig-

LOCAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS GRIDS [ LTG ]
When a decker first connects to the public grid at the start
of a run, his deck loads his icon onto an LTG. LTG ratings, at least
in North America, are usually equal to the System Ratings for the
parent RTG. In countries like Germany. however, the System
Ratings of LTGs and their parent RTGs may vary.
Optional Rule: Variable LTG Ratings
Gamemasters may vary an LTG's System Ratings to simulate
the constant system-load fluctuations, rerouting, and alerts com-
mon to LTGs. At the gamemaster's discretion, fluctuations may
affect specific locations in an LTG or the entire LTG and may last
for a few hours or the length of an entire adventure.
To determine the ratings of a fluctuating LTG. roll 1D6. On a
result of 1 or 2, reduce all the LTG's basic System Ratings by I.
On a 3 or 4, the basic ratings remain unchanged. On a result of
5 or 6. increase the LTG's System Ratings by 1.
The gamemaster may also implement specific changes in
the System Ratings of an LTG to reflect specific events or to
accommodate the background of an adventure,
PRIVATE LTGS
Private LTGs (PLTGs), as described on p. 169, SRII, actual-
ly represent independent, restricted global grids that are
closed to the general public. Most large corporations and all
megacorporations maintain at least one PLTG, Typically, most
developed countries maintain several government PLTGs,
which may extend to military or diplomatic sites outside the
countries' borders:
PLTGs are governed by the laws of the corp or country that
owns them. As a result. PLTG owners can install any anti-intru-
sion measures they desire. Because building a PLTG requires a
considerable investment. most owners don't skimp on the IC.
PLTGs are stable systems and their System Ratings do not vary.
When assigning System Ratings to a custom-designed
PLTG, the gamemaster should consider using Orange or Red
security codes and Intrusion Difficulties of Easy, as described in
Intrusion Difficulty, p. 31. System Ratings for several sample
PLTGs appear in Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149.
Entry Points
Corporate PLTGs span the globe. An LTG code like NA/LICAS-
NE-3617-EBMMHQ, referred to in the basic Shadowrun rules, actu-
ally identifies a single entry point on the EBMZ PLTG, a grid that
connects corporate host computers all over the world.
PTLGs may support multiple entry points connecting them
to different public grids. Saeder-Krupp's PLIG, for example, has
an entry point on the Rhine-Ruhr RTG in Germany (D03-11), and
a North American entry in New York (NA/UCAS-NE-4212-
SKRLIPP). Both have a System Rating of Red-5/8/10/9/10/10.
because they are actually parts of the same system.
Deckers may gain access to a PLTG through any of its entry
points, or by entering a host connected to the PLIG,
Regulations
Many countries strictly regulate the operation of PLTGs with-
in their public grids, despite corporate pressure to deregulate all
international PLTG access. In North America, the Pueblo and Ute
Councils, the Sioux Nation, Tir Tairngire, and Aztlan all maintain
anti-PLTG regulations. Overseas, PLTGs are regulated or forbid-
den in Tir na nog, Israel, Japan, the Confederated Azanian
Nations (outside of the Trans-Swazi Federation), some of the
other, stronger African states, and some of the single-vendor
ministates that virtually belong to one of the megacorps.
The Pueblo, Sioux, and Israelis maintain tight control over all
data traffic into and out of their countries as a matter of course
and outlaw all PLTGs. The Utes prohibit PLTGs because they
regard technological intrusions Into their sovereignty as a threat
to the old ways. The two Tirs are so paranoid about secrecy that
their principal motive remains anybody's guess
In general, PLTG regulations are politically motivated and
Inconsistent. For example. in countries where megacorps effec-
tively own the government, these megacorps reserve the right
to operate their own PLTGs while denying others the same right.
Similarly, Japan allows Japanese-owned corporations PLTG
access but denies it to foreign corps. And is anyone surprised to
know that Aztechnology's PLTG is the only corporate PLTG that
operates freely in Aztlan?
JACKPOINTS
Jackpoints consist of the physical connections deckers use to
access the Matrix. Each type of jackpoint has three values-
Trace, Access, and Base Bandwidth.
The Trace Factor Indicates the traceability of a jackpoint. The
lower the Trace Factor, the more easily Trace IC (see p. 45) can locate
the jackpoint. The Trace Factor applies for the decker's entire run.
The jackpoint's Access modifier applies to all the decker's
Access Tests during the run.
The base bandwidth value represents the maximum band-
width the jackpoint accepts without further reducing its Trace
Factor (see Cyberdecks, p. 81, for a description of the optional
bandwidth rules). If the decker's bandwidth exceeds the jack-
point's base bandwidth, use the following formula to calculate
the bandwidth Trace modifier. First, divide the decker's band-
width by the base bandwidth and round the result down.
Multiply that figure by -1. The result is the bandwidth Trace
modifier. For example, a decker with 78 Mp on a jackpoint with
a Base Bandwidth of 20 has an additional Trace modifier of -3 (78
divided by 20 equals 3.9, rounded down to 3 and multiplied by
-1). The bandwidth Trace modifier may change during the run as
the I/O bandwidth is increased or reduced, but it may never
drop below the modifier for the decker's icon bandwidth.
because that value is fixed for the entire Matrix run.
Gamemasters may vary the base bandwidth of jackpoints avail-
able at specific locations. For example, jackpoints at a cheap hacker
hotel that provides stolen trid connections might have base band-
widths of 10 Mp. Meanwhile, the optical trunks serving an office or
condo complex might have base bandwidths of 40 or 50 Mp.

The following text describes the vital statistics of common
jackpoints.
Legal Access
Trace Factor: - 2
Access: - 2
Base Bandwidth: 20
A legal-access jackpoint represents access from a legally
registered tridphone. Of course, it doesn't have to be your trid-
phone, omae,
Illegal Access
Trace Factor: +0
Access: +0
Base Bandwidth: 20
An illegal-access jackpoint represents access from either an
illegal tricphone connection (some unscrupulous soul has boosted
service from the phone company) or a tap, an illegal junction box
hooked directly into a fiber-optic trunk. The illegal-access jackpoint
is the most common jackpoint used by deckers.
Satellite Uplink
Trace Factor: See p. 30
Access: +2
Base Bandwidth: 50
The satellite uplink jackpoint is described in detail under
Satellite Links, p. 30.
Workstation
Trace Factor: - 4
Access: - 4
Base Bandwidth: 50
Workstations consist of cyberterminals connected directly to
a host. Naturally, the decker is not jacked into the wimped-out
terminal that the company provides but is running his own deck
over the same commline. Trace programs can spot these In a hot
tick, but they're cheese to break into.
Remote Device
Trace Factor: +4
Access: +4
Base Bandwidth: 20
Remote devices provide the means for the classic, sneaky,
back-door intrusion. The targeted host mounts grid defenses that
don't quit, and big goons with bigger guns guard the office ter-
minals, But the system runs a remote-controlled device-an
automated factory, à security terminal, even a vending
machine-that lets the decker slip his icon past all the gonzo IC
and straight into the guts of the system.
Remote devices are a bit harder to trace than most jack-
points because most IC searches for commlines initially and does
not start interrogating other input sources until it comes up
empty on the SANs. However, a decker will have to sweat to
defeat the remote device's Access codes because most systems
are not set up to take orders from a soda machine.
Console Access
Trace Factor: - 6
Access: See text
Base Bandwidth: Unlimited
A console can be the actual control panel on a mainframe,
or a workstation logged on with console access. Console access
Is also called supervisor, super-user, or sysop access.
Trace IC can locate a console-access jackpoint very easily,
but such jackpoints provide easy access to a decker. For deckers
attempting to access a system via a console-access jackpoint,
halve the opposing system's Access Rating and Security Value
for all Access Tests. Additionally, the decker can use all the band-
width he wants without lowering the jackpoint's Trace Factor.
However, gaining console access requires a really wiz ground
team of runners to get the decker into the machine room and
keep him alive long enough to do the biz.
GRID SECURITY TALLIES
Switching LTGs within the same the same RTG does not
affect the security tally against a decker. For example, If a decker
logs on to UCAS-SEA-2206 and incurs a tally of 2, then logs on
to the UCAS-SEA RTG central system and picks up another point
to his tally, then finally accesses UCAS-SEA-4206 and picks up
another 2 points, his Security Tally stands at 5 and stays at 5 for
as long as he is logged on to the UCAS-SEA grids. However, the
tally does not follow the decker if he logs on to another RTG.
PLTGs and Security Talles
Because PLTGs maintain very active security routines, a
security tally built up under a given RTG does remain in force if
the decker logs on to a PLTG from the RTG. This occurs because
PLTGs pick up security "flags" from RTGs when they acknowl-
edge log-ons. This means that a decker who racks up a big tally
working his way through the public grids may trigger IC as soon
as he enters private dataspace.
The decker in our example, with a Security Tally of 5, would
retain that tally when he enters a PLTG from the RTG. If that tally
Is enough to trigger security responses in the PLTG, they go off
as soon as he finishes the log-on. Whatever the immediate
result, his Security Tally on the PLTG begins at 5, plus any points
he incurs while logging on.
SYSTEM OPERATIONS ON GRIDS
In addition to the following System Operations, deckers can
always perform a Graceful Logoff operation at any time. For an
explanation of Graceful Logoffs and other System Operations,
see System Operations, p. 108.
from a Jachpoint
Deckers jacking in via legal or illegal trid can only perform the
Logon to LTG operation. Then they have to find the host/grid they
want to invade, if they don't know its location. Deckers jacking in
via a dedicated workstation, slave-controlled remote device, or
console can only perform the Logon to Host operation and must
log on to the host that controls the gizmo they are using for access.

On an LTG
Once logged on to an LTG, the decker can move to the par-
ent RTG with a Logon to RTG operation or try to access any host
connected to the LTG with a Logon to Host operation, If a PLTG
is attached to the LTG the decker is on, he can use a Logon to
LTG to try to break into it.
The decker can also attempt Redirect Datatrail and Retrain
operations from an LTG.
When the decker enters a PLTG, remember that any security
tally built up in previous tests on the RTG and its LTGs follows the
character and can trigger immediate problems for the decker,
On an RTG
Once logged on to an RTG, the decker can either move to
another RTG (i.e., make a "long-distance call" to get on to the Grid
in another part of the world) by using a Logon to RTG operation or
enter any LTG attached to the RTG with a Logon to LTG operation.
The character may also perform the following operations on
an RTG: Locate Access Node, Make Comcall, Redirect Datatrail,
Retrain, Tap Comcall.
On a PLIG
A decker logged on to a PLTG may perform any System
Operation available on public RTGs and LTGs.
SATELLITE LINKS
When a decker taps directly into a communications satellite
to enter the Matrix, he trades higher Access target numbers for
partial immunity to Trace IC. Signal lag over the satlink also
reduces Reaction by -2.
While Trace IC can locate the satellite jackpoint, it can-
nor pinpoint the decker's physical location, making physi-
cal response to the Matrix intrusion Impossible. The
other effects of a successful trace still apply (see Trace
IC. p. 45),
To access the Matrix via a satellite, a decker must
have a deck equipped with a satlink interface
(sec Cyberdecks, p. 81), The satlink software
enables the decker to locate a commsat.
The Base Time to isolate the satellite and
lock onto its transponder is 3 min-
utes. To do so, the decker must
make a successful Computer
Test against a target number
based on the conditions of
the attempt, as shown on
the Satlink Target Numbers
Table
21
Failure to achieve any
successes means that the
decker fails to locate the
satellite or lock on to its
transponder. As a rule of
thumb, the gamemaster
can allow the character to
make another attempt after five minutes or so, and more fre-
quently in dire situations.

Decking the Satellite
For game purposes, satellites function as LTGs but are clas-
sified as Orange-Average or even Orange-Hard systems with no
reduction in Subsystem Ratings. Rate military and private corpo-
rate comsars as Red-Hard.
Once the decker locates the satellite, he can perform a
Logon to I.TG operation to access it. From the satellite, a decker
can perform a Logon to RTG operation to any RTG on earth, He
can access most systems in near-earth orbit as well, if they use
that particular satellite for communications. In case any suicidal
deckers ask, no, Zurich-Orbital does not use satellite protocols
this way, so this trick is not an effective back door into that most
icy of Matrix domains.
Security tallies generated on a satellite carry over to the RTG
that the decker accesses.
HOSTS
Host systems serve as the computer installations where the
Sixth World processes all its information. Billions of nuyen and
Inestimable megapulses of data flow through these systems
daily. Host systems act as the vaults where secrets are stashed-
the technological wonders of hundreds of R& D departments, the
hidden dirt of the gleaming corporate world, secret identities
and true names.
SECURITY CODES
The security code of a host measures the level of security
precautions the host maintains. Generally, the code reflects the
sensitivity of the data on the host, but it may also simply reflect
the degree of paranoia suffered by the host's owner.
Blue Hosts
Blue hosts include most public-service databases: newsfax
distribution systems, public library databases, directories of listed
commcodes-pretty much anything free, whether provided by a
government, a corp, or a private individual. Small businesses too
poor to secure their systems tend to have Blue hosts as well.

Every snot-nosed Matrix wannabe with a cheap deck and
time on his hands targets Blue systems. As a result, these sys-
tems usually carry a fair share of Matrix graffiti: virus code that
displays obscene "wit" when a user logs on, datastores frag-
mented by random vandalism, amateurish icons that simply sit in
memory being obnoxious. The "protection" programs common-
ly Imposed on Blue systems are a bit nastier. These smartframes
will gut system files if the netpunks don't get their weekly "dona
tion" from the system owner,
Green Hosts
Green hosts are average systems, but never make the mis
take of thinking a Green host represents easy prey. They may be
more patient with intruders than the Orange or Red systems, but
they can load any IC the hotter hosts mount.
Green hosts include public databases that charge minimal
user fees, open computer nets at colleges (though not the ones
used by corp-funded research projects), and corporate and gov-
ernment computers that run the day-to-day office work.
Orange Hosts
Orange hosts pride themselves on being secure systems, If
not wild-eyed killer hosts. Orange hosts store your standard
"secret" data and carry out processing that is Important but not
absolutely essential to the host's operators, Orange systems
Include the typical factory controller and the networks used by
middle management in a typical corporate office.
Red Hosts
Red hosts offer the most security that a system may legally
carry. They contain "top secret" data, often the kind owners will
kill to protect, and mission-critical process controls (life support.
vital labs and factorles, power grids, and the like). Anti-intrusion
defenses tend to be lethal-deckers get no "warning shots" on
Red systems.
INTRUSION DIFFICULTY
The System Ratings of a host-the Security Value and
Subsystem Ratings-are based on a measurement called
Intrusion Difficulty. Matrix 2.0 rares systems with Intrusion
Difficulties of Easy, Average, or Hard, Generally, Intrusion
Difficulty is based on the level of "user-friendliness" that the sys-
tem must have to do its job, and the number of users who access
the host on a typical day.
Easy Systems
Generally. Easy systems share their functions among many
different users and offices. These systems handle high volumes
of traffic and accommodate many demands on their computing
power. As a result, these hosts can devote only meager
resources to security. Typical Easy systems include highly cen-
tralized corporate computers, educational systems, and cheap
systems installed by small businesses.
Average Systems
Generally, Average systems support smaller user-bases than
Easy systems, and they handle more limited and secure transac-
tions. Typical Average corporate systems serve a single office or
division, often with a user-base limited to executives and their
Immediate staff. Prosperous small companies also use Average
systems, as would R&D projects dealing with less-than-earth-
shaking research.
Hard Systems
Hard systems handle the most secure data and restrict
access to a favored few users. Typical Hard systems include
financial transfer systems, major R&D facilities, private corporate
executive networks, secure military systems, virtually all intelli-
gence systems, and critical public systems like air traffic control
or municipal power
SYSTEM RATINGS
The gamemaster sets host System Ratings based on the
host's Intrusion Difficulty. The gamemaster may use dice rolls or
his discretion to create these ratings.
Random Generation
To ser System Ratings randomly: the gamemaster simply
rolls the dice indicated on the Random Host System-Rating
Table. (1D3 equals IDo divided by 2.) The Information on the
table assumes that an "average" decker possesses utilities with a
Rating of 4. As a result, using the table may produce System
Ratings that present little challenge for deckers with significantly
higher utility ratings. In such cases, gamemasters may wish to
generate System Ratings using the Assigned Numbers method
(see below).

The gamemaster is designing a host that holds key evidence
of corporate double-dealing. He decides it is a computer serving
a regional office of Aztechnology, It carries sensitive data, and
AZT is notoriously paranoid about deckers, so he gives it a
Security Code of Red. However, the system must serve a moder-
ately large user base efficiently, so he determines that it is an
Average system.
The gamemaster rolls 106 for the Security Value. The dice roll
produces a 3, which the gamemaster divides by 2 and rounds up
for a result of 2. That yields a final Security Value of 8 (6 + 2).
Now he rolls five times for the Subsystem Ratings. On an Average
host, the dice roll is 203 + 9. His rolls produce results of 11, 15,
13,13,12. The final System Ratings for the AZT host are:
Security: Red-8

Access: 11
Control: 15
Index: 13
Files: 13
Slave: 12
or Red-8/11/15/13/13/12.
Terrifying for a beginning decker with Computer-6 and a
cheap deck. Cheese for a scarred veteran of the Matrix punch-
ing a Fairlight's console. Should give pause for thought to the 99
percent of deckers who fit somewhere in between.
Assigned numbers
The gamemaster can simply assign values to the host's
System Ratings as follows, enabling him to create challenging
hosts based on a specific decker's resources.
Intrusion
Security
Subsystem
Difficulty
Value
Ratings
Easy
4 to 6
8 to 10
Average
7 to 9
11 to 15
Hard
8 to 12
13 to 18
Regardless of how the gamemaster sets the System Ratings.
however, he can always tweak a rating up or down to better
match the abilities of the player characters, The gamemaster also
should ensure that all ratings match the fictional systems they
represent. A system in Fuchi's Chiba network, for example,
should be a tough nut to crack, and its System Ratings should
reflect that degree of difficulty. A player character lacking excel-
lent skills and hot utilities should have less than no hope of
defeating such a system. Use the following general guidelines for
setting ratings.
A final Target Number of 3 or less is cheese.
A typical starting player character with Computer-
6 and a decent Detection Factor to keep the IC off
his neck will defeat such ratings most of the time,
especially If they are defended by a wimpy 4 or 5
points of security. An Average system will provide
stiff opposition for a decker with these ratings. A
Hard system will probably defeat such a decker
unless he is very lucky.
Deckers with skill of 8 or more. Detection
Factors of 8 or 9, and utilities in the 8-point or
higher range find Hard systems challenging but
defeatable.
Optional Rule Varying Subsystem Ratings
Gamemasters may raise or lower individual
Subsystem Ratings of hosts to give these systems
distinct flavors. For example, if the gamemaster
wants to make it difficult for a decker to access an
Easy system but encourage a more innovative
approach involving a meatworld raid on a corp
site. he might increase the Access Rating by 2 for
entry points on public grids and reduce the Access Rating by I for
a dedicated workstation or remote device, altering the Access
modifiers from those jackpoints as well.
Similarly, the gamemaster might vary the Files Ratings of a
host. For example, he might decide that all of a system's public-
relations files, the advertising brochures of the information age.
carry a Files Rating 2 points lower than the system's base Files
Rating. At the same time, the system's personnel management
files, including all e-mail and personal journals, schedules, and so
on. have a Files Rating 2 points higher than the system's base
Files Rating,
SYSTEM TRICKS
Though the System Operations section (p. 108) describes
the majority of host system operations, the following system
tricks appear here because they can be viewed as "meta-opera-
tions," operations that affect the entire environment in which
deckers and programs operate. The "bouncer" host offers an
excellent example of such a meta-operation.
Bouncers
A bouncer host operates at an apparently low level of secu-
rity but upgrades its Security Rating when it detects intrusion. For
example, in its normal state a host may carry Orange or Green
security. When the security tally reaches a specific point, usually
after a fairly low number of tests, the mainframe actually loads in
new security code and changes into a Red system with a higher
Security Value.
If a decker logs on and runs an Analyze Host diagnostic
operation, he will determine that he is entering a Green-4 host.
Null sweat. He goes about his business until he triggers the
bouncer. On the next turn, the system turns into a Red-8 host!

PLTG

A bouncer takes 1 turn to make the upgrade, Whenever a
decker triggers a bouncer, the gamemaster makes a Sensor
(Security Value) Test, using the system's original Security Value,
If the test results in any successes, the decker notices that the
Security Rating is rising but must perform an Analyze Host oper-
ation to determine the new security code and value. The decker
makes the test for this operation against the new Security Rating.
If he fails to achieve any successes, the decker must perform
another Analyze Host operation to find out why the computer
has suddenly become so hostile. (See p. 111 for a description of
the Analyze Host operation),
Highly secure areas of a specific host also may function as
bouncers automatically, regardless of the security tally. For
example, any operations on top-secret R&D datafiles might trig-
ger a bouncer as soon as the host achieves a single success
against a user, Even legitimate users opening these files may
trigger higher security, just as an authorized bank employee
opening a vault may trigger alarm klaxons and flashing lights.
Chokepoints
A chokepoint host exists solely to block unauthorized access
to more sensitive computers. Traditionally, these hosts serve sys-
tems that are linked together so that users must pass through the
chokepoint host to reach other hosts in the system.
Chokepoints generally protect sensitive hosts that must
maintain constant Matrix access, such as financial management,
air-traffic control, and power-grid management systems. The
chokepoint usually has higher System Ratings than the host it
protects. especially chokepoints guarding high-volume systems
that normally offer Easy or Average Intrusion Difficulties.
The "killing jar" architecture found at the Denver datahaven
represents one of the ultimate developments of chokepoint
design (see p. 79, Denver, The City of Shadows). Rumor claims
that the engineers there have dedicated a massively parallel
ultramini to run the murderous IC in this design. Certainly it takes
something at least that powerful to make the chokepoint as
impassable as it seems.
Chokepoints can be stoppers on Matrix runs. A decker can
try to bull through with brute force and hot programs, but this
approach can prove a real gamble. The smartest approach is to
locate alternate access paths to the target host that allow the
decker to bypass the chokepoint host altogether.
Figure I In the Chokepoint Designs diagram shows a simple
chokepoint design. The only way into the target host is through
the Red host that connects the system to the LTG. Unless the
decker bypasses the grid altogether and gains access to a work-
station, slave remote, or similar jackpoint, he must tackle the
Red-8 monster to get to the goodies on the Orange-6 host.
Actually, such arrangements are rare on all but the most sensi-
tive systems, because few operators can afford to tie up so many
resources behind impassable security. Figure 2 shows a much
more common configuration. Here, a nasty chokepoint blocks
public access to the target host, but a decker can sidestep it via
the corporate PLTG and a cheesy office LAN with a dedicated
connection to the target.
Trap Doors
Trap doors offer "secret passages" from one host to another
or to a PLTG. A host may appear to be isolated from the Matrix
but have a comm port that is not accessible via its Access rou-
tines, Instead, some other subsystem controls passage to the tar-
get host.
For example, the Shiseki-gumo, a yakuza clan, hides its main
computer behind a trap door on an Innocuous Green-5 business
computer belonging to Tri-Marine Exports, An Analyze
Subsystem operation that examines the Access subsystem finds
nothing unusual. Analyzing the Slave subsystem, however,
reveals a dedicated port connected directly to another host.
The decker must perform a Graceful Logoff using the
Subsystem Rating that conceals the trap door before he can
Logon to Host to reach the host to which it leads. For example,
on the Tri-Marine computer, the decker must make a successful
Slave Test to get out through the trap door, then an Access Test
to get into the Shiseki computer on the "other side." (See pp.
114, 116, for descriptions of Graceful Logoff and Logon to Host
operations.)
Trap doors are particularly nasty when combined with
chokepoints. To defeat such arrangements, the decker must bit-
flip around in the very hostile environment of the chokepoint
host, looking for the trap door that leads to the goodies.
Vanishing SAfls
Vanishing SANS (System Access Nodes) represent entry
points on an LTG or PLTG active only at specific times. At all other
times, these SANs are closed and do not even appear in the RTG!
They simply do not exist except when active. A decker perform-
ing a Locate Access Node operation when a vanishing SAN is
open will find it. A second later, when the SAN closes, he will
not. Very sensitive systems that must maintain realtime Matrix
access to perform their functions may use all sorts of variations
on this trick.
To log on to a system via a vanishing SAN. the decker must
wait until the SAN becomes active and then succeed in a Logon
to Host operation before it disappears again. If the operation suc-
ceeds, the decker has jammed open the SAN and set up spoof
code that makes the host think its access node is safely offline
again. If the operation fails before the SAN disappears, the sys.
tem dumps the decker.
Typically, vanishing SANs stay open for no more than 10 to
20 seconds. For a typical vanishing SAN. the gamemaster rolls
ID6 + 1. The result is the number of turns the decker may try to
log on.
Vanishing SANs include timed, teleporting, and triggered SANS.
Timed SANS are the simplest form of vanishing SANS. A
timed SAN always uses the same LTG code and opens at set
times each day, The Blological Library computer at MIT&M, for
example, opens a connection to the LTG every day at 0600,
1200. and 1800 Eastern time to share e-mail, abstracts, and
other traffic with the rest of the Matrix. A decker who wants to
access this host from the grid must be waiting at one of those

times and then must sneak past the Access protection to get
online before the transfers end.
Teleporting SANs generally belong only to major megacorps
and governments with the wealth and clout to broker the neces-
sary contracts with the RTG vendors. Each time a teleporting
SAN disappears, it cancels its account on the RTG and subscribes
to an entirely different RTG for its next appearance, This trick is
analogous to having an unlisted comm number that changes
your comm code, AND your area code, AND your country code.
after every call.
Saeder-Krupp Prime division operates a wandering node
that uses this trick. It can open Matrix access at 09:00:01 GMT
on a German LTG, close at 09:00:07 and re-open at 09:01:01
with an LTG address under a UCAS RTG. Now you see it, now
you-hey, where th frag did it go ?!
Teleporting SANs switch their network addresses based on
secret algorithms. Systems that provide access to SANs also
store this algorithm, so that they know where to reach the SAN
at any given time. Say Saeder-Krupp Aerospace needs to deliv-
er a report to S-K Prime's teleporting SAN. It "looks at its watch"
(I.e., the computer takes the clock tick), feeds it into a "black
box" routine, and voila-a comm code and an access time
comes out (seems Prime is on a Japanese LTG this morning).
Connecting to that code at that time will allow the call to go
through:
A teleporting SAN intended for outgoing connections only
needs no external algorithm at all. The host can even negotiate
new node addresses based on an entirely random process, pick-
Ing RTGs out of the thin, virtual air of the Matrix.
To jump a teleporting SAN. a decker must possess the
SAN's algorithm code so that he can predict the SAN's where-
abouts. Alternatively, the decker can run a frame with an Event
Trigger (see p. 107) that performs periodic Search RTG opera-
tions to monitor selected RTGs and notifies him when the new
SAN appears in the lookup tables, For one-time runs, an employ-
er or some other asset may provide a decker with the coordi-
nates of a vanishing SAN.
The slang term "Port-a-SANs" applied to teleporting SANS
is a regrettable indication of the maturity level of certain deckers.
and the present author assumes no responsibility for it.
Triggered SANS are access nodes that open only in response
to specific actions elsewhere in the Matrix. For example, the R&D
host for Yamatetsu's gene-tech center only opens when a Slave
operation on the Yamatetsu-North America HQ processor trig
gers a satellite signal (non-data bandwidth, useless for decking).
The Slave operation, in turn, is triggered by hits on a periodic
database search by the HQ machine that finds an update in one
of the scientific exchange conversations that the program moni-
tors for the wizkids in research, The Slave node itself lives on a
secured system hiding behind a glacier, but the publications
monitor runs on a box hooked into the moderately secure
Neurobionics Forum network.
Couple this scheme with teleporting SAN architecture, and
predicting where or when the R&D SAN will open becomes
impossible. To do so, a decker would have to know how the trig-
gers work, locate the next address for the SAN, then compro-
mise the event triggers somehow (plant a false hit in the
Neurobionics Forum that Yamatetsu's program will want to dellv-
er, or get into the Yamatetsu HQ computer and trigger the signal
to the R&D host, or Invade the satellite link and send a false sig-
nal that the R& D host accepts as legit) and then be ready to jump
the access node when it opens.
For a variation on triggered SAN architecture, see the wild-
ly paranoid design of the uplinks to Zurich-Orbital, described on
p. 94. Corporate Shadowfiles.
Virtual Machines
A virtual machine (VM) is a simulated host run as a subpro-
gram by the real host, sometimes called the native host. System
operations on the VM do not affect the actual host operations,
For example, editing a file on a VM does not alter the actual stor-
age in the native host's datastores. Furthermore, VMs can filter
any sensitive data out of downloaded files automatically. before
the data even gets into the VM processing area. The decker can-
not even recognize that he is getting watered-down information
unless he monitors the file as it downloads and knows. based on
some other source of knowledge, that the data is incomplete or
false. Decryption simply does not work at all.
Nothing a decker does to a VM affects the native computer.
Even crashing or throttling the VM host simply alters the way the
VM program runs-it will not do a thing to the native host. Frames,
virus code, logic bombs-all can trash the VM as hard as they want
but they will not damage a single pulse of data on the real host.
On the other hand (you knew there was another hand, didn't
you?), everything that happens on a VM seems quite real to a
decker-drek. it is real as far as virtual reality is concerned.
Crashing a VM will dump a decker, even though the crash will not
affect the native host. System Tests made on a VM run up securi-
ty tallies as usual, and IC on a VM feels every bit as nasty as IC on
a native host. Program code running in a VM affects a decker's
persona the same as it does anywhere else-usually painfully.
A VM's maximum System Ratings are 2 points lower than
the native host's, though the security code can be the same. 50
a VM running on an Orange-7 host could have a maximum
Security Rating of Orange-5. Similarly. If the native machine has
Access-10. the maximum rating on the VM would be Access-8.
A VM can be designed with lower ratings than these maxi-
mums, of course, Some hosts use this technique to camouflage
themselves from deckers. The Intruder finds a cheesy Green-4
system. containing nothing but promotional simsense brochures
and the general manager's laundry list, and (after marveling at
how much it costs to launder real wool these days), departs for
more lucrative pastures-without realizing he was on the exec-
utive accounting Red-8 host.
Rumor has it that some of the more powerful systems nest
VM architectures. The decker logs on to a Green-4 system,
detects that it is a VM and busts out into a Red-6 host. He loots
it down to the last pulse and logs off, never realizing that the
Red-6 host was actually a VM run on a Red-8 native host. All that
paydata is fool's gold, carefully sanitized before it ever fed into
the second layer of deception.

A decker can detect a VM by deliberately testing for it with
an Analyze Host operation. Breaking out of a VM into the native
host requires a Control Test against the native host's Security
Rating (see System Ratings, p. 16). The number of successes the
decker scores over the native host's opposing test determines
whether or not he achieves his goal. One success enables a deck-
er to break out of a Blue VM. Two successes are required for a
Green VM, three successes for an Orange and four successes to
break out of a Red VM.
Because VMs are designed to confine user icons, a decker's
security tally increases if he achieves successes on the Control Test
but fails to break out of the VM. In this situation, increase the secu-
Ilty tally by the number of successes by which the decker fell short.
For example, a decker must achieve 3 successes to break out of an
Orange VM. If the decker only scores 2 successes on his Control
Test, raise his security tally 1 point. Each success the native host
scored in the opposing test also is added to the security tally.
If and when a decker does break out of a VM Into the
native host, he retains his current security tally. If he had a
Security Tally of 8 before he broke out and picked up 2 more
points during his Control Test, he would have a Security Tally of
10 on the native host.
PASSCODES
Passcodes consist of access codes that guarantee automatic
success when attempting certain tasks or manipulating specific
files on a computer. Any activity not authorized by the passcode
requires System Tests and can jeopardize the passcode.
For example, a passcode would enable a legitimate user to
log on to his office host without performing a Logon to Host
operation. He reads a file he has access to-no need for a Files
Test. thanks to his passcode. But the passcode does him no good
when he snoops into office e-mail and tries to read another
user's mail (he does not have authorized access to the e-mail).
He has perform Locate File and Download Data operations, same
as a nasty old decker would, because he is working outside the
authorizations of his passcode.
The guy's in trouble if anyone catches him and checks the
system logs, because his terminal identifies all his activities, legal
and Illegal, On large, busy systems, minor violations like this
often go undetected. They always show up within 2D6 days on
systems rated Orange or Red, depending on how often the sys-
tern security manager conducts audits,
Passcade formats
Simple passcodes consist of sets of symbols. The user
enters the symbol set when he wants to log on to the host and
if he does it right, the host grants him access, Because the
Matrix is a virtual reality, passcode symbols can include letters,
words, tunes, even specific movements, If a decker learns
someone's passcode, he can use it to log on to the host any-
where the code is valid.
Linked passcodes work in combination with the MPCP sig-
nature of the user's terminal. Because a decker's persona will not
have the same signature, the passcode alone will not work for
him. However, a decker can use a deception utility to mimic the
legitimate MPCP signature. In these situations, a stolen linked
passcode provides a decker with a -2 bonus for his Logon to
Host operation.
Passkeys are passcodes locked to a specific chip installed
on the user's terminal. To use a stolen passkey, a decker must
also steal or duplicate the key-chip. Software solutions such as
the deception utility won't cut it. A passkey without the right
chip on the terminal or deck simply does not work. If the deck-
er gets the algorithm for the chip that goes with a given
passkey, the "program" that he must write and cook into a chip
is 10 Mp. See Cyberdecks, p. 81, and Programs, p. 94, for
details of this process.
If a decker successfully uses a passcode to log on to a sys-
tem, he receives all the authorizations the passcode's legitimate
user possesses. The same applies to fake passcodes that the
decker plants on the host for later use.
So why can't deckers just salt the Matrix with fake pass-
codes and then use them forever? Couple of reasons. First, all but
the most lax system managers Insist on changing passcodes at
least once every three months. High-security systems change
them weekly. The most paranoid operators use algorithms that
combine the date and time with a pseudo-random number gen-
erator to produce a new passcode every time a user needs to log
on. In this arrangement, the users carry pocket units that tell
them what their passcode will be at any given time. If they lose
the pocket unit, they have to request a new one that will use a
different passcode generation scheme. Organizations that use
this system never install passcode generators.
Second, the system immediately deactivates passcodes
whenever someone logged on with one performs any actions
that trigger an active alert in the host. As long as the user only
performs operations for which he has authorization, this won't
happen. Unfortunately, few passcodes authorize the wide range
of operations most deckers want to perform in a system.
Finally, many megacorp systems require a user to present
his passkey code and submit to an identification check, such as a
retinal scan, before granting the user access.
Passcode Authorization
These rules cannot cover all the options for how organiza-
tions can control passcodes, though most systems provide fairly
specific authorizations. For example, a system might authorize a
user with passcode MPCP 93847752-ADN-34626-ZZ to log on
between 0800-1800 PST from (a list of jackpoint locations) and
provide read/write access to (a list of files) and read-only access
to (a list of files).
When introducing specific passcodes into an adventure, the
gamemaster must determine the authorizations the passcode
provides. Use the following general levels of passcode autho-
rizations as guidelines.
User Passcodes provide the lowest levels of authorization
and impose precise restrictions on what the user can do, as In

the previous example. They are of little use to a decker once he
has logged on to the host,
Most legitimate users carry user passcodes, with authoriza-
tions tailored precisely to their job requirements.
Superuser Passcodes consist of high-level passcodes that
usually give the user the right to read all but the most sensitive
files on a host or to access all but the most important Slave sys-
tems. This passcode does not authorize the user to perform
operations involving Control, except for simple things like writ-
ing programs,
Scramble IC, data bombs, and other defenses protect the
system against superusers, though files or remote systems
specifically authorized by the passcode do not block the user. In
other words, stealing the superuser passcode for a finance man-
ager would probably get a decker into the company's secret
financial database, but a passcode for an engineering specialist
probably would not.
Organizations issue superuser passcodes to senior technical
staff, line managers, and other mid-level suits,
Supervisor passcodes authorize almost any activity except
destruction of important data or actions that damage the host or
put it out of action. As with superuser passcodes. not all super-
visor passcodes authorize access to everything. But until the host
reaches an active alert, supervisor passcodes provide users with
-2 modifiers to all System Tests target numbers, even for actions
not authorized by the passcode,
Only technical managers, senior managers in general, and
data security specialists receive the rarely issued supervisor pass-
codes. Corp deckers receive the most powerful supervisor pass-
codes, for use when they are in pursuit of intruders on the hosts
they guard.
HOST NETWORKS
A host network consists of a series of com-
puters linked in a tiered-access configuration. The
first-tier host, called the switcher or hub, guards
the pathway to all the second-tier machines. The
host network offers a convenient design for the
gamemaster setting up a situation involving many
hosts, all basically identical, serving different func-
tions in an organization, For example, the
Accounting, Sales, Engineering, and Maintenance
groups at a given corporate office are all separate
hosts. Only the amount of paydata and the specif-
ic datafiles or slave systems onboard differentiate
these hosts. The security sheaf for each host looks
the same (see Matrix Hot Spots, p. 149);
Arranging these hosts into a host network can
provide ease of play and a logical design. In a typi-
cal two-tier network, a first-tier host-probably a
high-security chokepoint system-connects the net-
work to the grid. Any number of second-tier hosts
live "behind" the first-tier machine. To travel from the
hub to a second-tier system, a decker must perform
an Analyze Subsystem operation on the Access subsystem of the
first-tier host (unless the designers are wildly paranoid and hid the
connection to the second-tier hosts in a trap door on a different
subsystem) to find the connections, then perform a Logon to Host
to the second-tier host.
These operations Include the equivalent of a Graceful Logoff
on the first-tier hub, so if the system is running Trace IC, add the IC
rating to the decker's target number for the logon to the new
host-the Trace will be registering strong objections to the hub's
switching software about this departure, after all, However, if the
decker successfully logs on to the second-tier host, the hub loses
his datatrail, and any Trace running against him in the hub crashes.
To pass from any single host in a network to another, the
decker must perform a Logon to Host operation from the sec-
ond-tier machine back onto the hub, and then another Logon to
Host to get to the next computer.
lletwork files and lodes
A first-tier hub rarely contains data of any value. Because the
hub functions as the "traffic cop" for the network, however, it must
"know" what functions its second-tier machines handles. As a
result, deckers on a hub can perform operations such as Locate File
or Locate Slave for the entire host network. These operations can
Identify which second-tier host contains a specific datafile or con-
trols a certain remote device. Once the decker logs on to the cor-
rect second-tier host, another Locate File or Locate Slave operation
provides the address of the icon he wants.
UU HOSTS
Ultraviolet hosts are extremely rare. They possess higher
System Ratings than the toughest Red hosts, and their process-
ing power is so great that it creates cyberspace of a qualitative-
ly different order of reality. On a UV host, a decker cannot dif-

ferentiate between the virtual experience of cyberspace and
physical reality, This makes UV hosts an entirely different cre-
ation from any other form of host.
Only a hot deck (see Cyberdecks, p. 81) can even log on to
a UV host. Cool decks and tortoises cannot interact with the core
processing area of a UV host. They can access so called buffer
systems, which translate data flows into and out of the main
computational space, but nothing more. Icons representing cool
decks or terminals cannot cross the interface between the buffer
systems and the UV core
On a UV host, the decker's persona changes-often drasti-
cally. It becomes a character with Strength and Body Ratings
equal to its Bod Rating, Quickness equal to the persona's Evasion
Rating, and Mental Attributes equal to the decker's own. Utility
programs become physical tools, weapons, armor, and the like.
or have no effect at all, depending on the nature of those utilities
and the exact defenses located within the UV host. The decker
uses his real skills in a UV host but may always substitute half his
Computer skill Instead.
But here's the most fun part of UV hosts. Any damage to the
decker's persona is damage to the decker himself. If his persona
experiences Mental damage, his own Mental Condition Monitor
reflects it. If his persona suffers apparent physical damage, it is
Physical damage. Jacking out of a UV host exposes the decker to
12D Stun damage from dump shock. If he's already taken a beating.
that could overflow his Mental Condition Monitor and prove fatal.
Apart from these guidelines, anything goes. Consider the
physical laws of LIV cyberspace Infinitely flexible. The gamemaster
may, and must, define them to suit the particular run. Not that runs
to UV space are that common. Getting there is dangerous, logging
on puts the decker at profound risk, and there aren't that many LIV
systems out there. At the current time (2056), LIV hosts remain
nothing more than rumors among the decking community, Right?
Where Are the UV Hosts?
No one is entirely sure which matrices harbor LIV hosts. The
Denver Nexus definitely has UV qualities in some of its memory
spaces. Rumor says the UCAS government maintains a site of UV
cyberspace, but thousands of rumors put it In as many different
locations. Other reports claim that the governments of Tir na nog
and, startlingly, the Zulu Nation maintain UV hosts The main
processing cores of supercomplexes such as the Zurich-O and
the Renraku Arcology may be Ultraviolet as well.
What's more, certain evidence suggests that a sufficiently
powerful processing complex can develop Ultraviolet levels of
virtual reality without the knowledge of Its operators. The UV
area of the core processing space may come and go, depending
on the amount of available computer power on the system. This.
of course, raises the alarming possibility that a decker might find
himself in what he fondly belleved to be a humble Red-12 sys-
tem that transforms suddenly into a UV environment.
Gamemasters might consider hitting deckers caught in such a
radical and disorientating transformation with some equivalent
of dump shock.
One theory contends that UV cyberspace cannot exist with-
out an Al maintaining It. However, no verifiable data supports
the existence of Als, and so the origin of spontaneous UV cyber-
space environments remains a matter of speculation.

IC stands for Intrusion countermeasures, (For all you Matrix virgins, It's pronounced "Ice.")
Some IC just impedes the decker, maybe tries to get a network ID on him. Other programs are
designed to crash his icon off the Matrix. Still others go after his deck. Finally, there's black IC-
which flat out tries to kill him
IC Is a major functional element of most host systems, which were covered in the previous
section. However, any explanation of IC Inevitably involves system operations and cybercom
bat. In-depth coverage of these subjects appears in the sections titled Programs (p. 94). System
Operations (p. 108) and Cybercombat (p. 119).

PROACTIVE VS. REACTIVE
IC Is either proactive or reactive, Proactive IC attacks the
decker In cybercombat once it is alerted to his presence (see
Cybercombat. p. 119); Proactive IC acts like a hostile NPC. It
makes Initiative rolls during combat, maneuvers for advantage.
and uses its weapons and other tricks.
Reactive IC. on the other hand, just "sits there." It may acti-
vate when the security tally reaches a specific threshold, decker
actions may trigger it, or it may reside in a specific location or
resource of the host, such as a file, slave remote, or even an
entire subsystem. In the latter case, the IC becomes active when
a decker accesses the protected location or resource. Once a
decker triggers reactive IC, the IC affects the decker's operations
until the decker destroys or deceives it, or otherwise convinces
it to go away. Reactive IC rarely possesses Initiative.
Trace IC offers an exception to the proactive/reactive rule.
Trace IC uses Initiative when trying to lock on to a decker's comm
connection and begin the actual trace process. At all other times
it acts as reactive IC, running happily in the background once it
Identifies the decker's datatrail.
LOCATING IC
Deckers don't always know when they trigger IC. Before a
decker can attack IC or take other measures to neutralize it. a
decker must "locate" the IC.
Obviously, a decker can easily locate proactive IC as soon as
it attacks him. Once located, the IC remains "visible" unless it
maneuvers to escape the decker (see Combat Maneuvers, p.
121).
Reactive IC is more insidious, because it does not betray its
presence to the decker by any actions. Whenever a decker trig-
gers reactive IC. the gamemaster secretly makes a Sensor Test
against a target number equal to the IC's rating. If the test results
in | success, the gamemaster informs the decker that his actions
triggered IC. On 2 successes, the gamemaster tells the decker
the type of IC triggered. On 3 or more successes, the gamemas-
ter reveals the IC's rating and location. This Sensor Test is made
only once. when the IC becomes active.
If a decker suspects the presence of active IC, he can use the
Locate IC operation to check out that suspicion.
CRASHING IC
Whenever a decker "kills" or crashes IC in cybercombat, add
the rating of the crashed IC to the decker's security tally, The
rationale for this is that crashing IC is like opening up on a
perimeter guard with full autocannon fire-the action destroys
the guard but alerts his colleagues that company's coming.
However, deckers may use various methods to more quietly
crash or neutralize IC.
First, deckers may use the stealth option with attack pro-
grams (see Programs, p. 94). This reduces the number of points
added to the security tally for the IC's destruction. For example,
crashing a Probe-6 with an attack program normally adds 6
points to a decker's security tally. Attack with the Stealth-3
option, however, would reduce the points to 3. Stealth programs
rated at 6 or higher hide the "dying scream" of IC altogether.
If the gamemaster chooses to not use the Utility Options
optional rule, he simply may increase a decker's security tally by
half the rating of any IC the decker destroys (round fractions up).
The Utility Options rule makes life significantly less dangerous for
the decker (as does the use of the stealth option in particular),
but it may also make life significantly less challenging and inter-
esting to drek-hot deckers with meganuyen cyberdecks and util-
Ities. The gamemaster may also decide that this "half-rating" rule
applies only to certain systems. For example, it might apply to
Blue, Green and Orange systems but not to Red systems where
the IC can be expected to be especially vicious and the system
more ready to shift to a higher alert status.
SUPPRESSING IC
A decker also can avoid the penalty for crashing IC by sup-
pressing it when he destroys it. However, suppressing IC lowers
a decker's Detection Factor, Reduce a decker's Detection Factor
by 1 for each IC program he suppresses, This reduction remains
in effect as long as the decker remains in the system, unless he
releases the suppressed IC.
Deckers must declare their intention to suppress IC as soon
as they crash it. Deckers may "unsuppress" or release IC at any
time. For each IC program the decker releases, he regains 1 point
to his Detection Factor. His security tally, however, Increases by
the appropriate amount for each released IC program.
IC RATINGS
Each IC program has its own rating. This rating measures the
damage the IC does or acts as a target number for tests the deck-
er makes to avoid its effects.
In cybercombat, an IC program makes its Attack Tests using
its host's Security Value as a "skill", to determine, the number of
dice it rolls. In other words, the host computer attacks the deck-
er and uses the IC as a weapon.
The host/grid's Security Value also indicates the number of
dice rolled to make Damage Resistance Tests for the IC program.
WHITE IC
White IC affects only the decker's online icon. It attacks the
icon's ratings but does not affect the cyberdeck's permanent rat-
ings or utilities. The worst that white IC can do is dump a deck-
er or scramble data he is trying to read or write. Note, however,
that a decker operating a hot deck may suffer some slight phys-
Ical damage from simsense overload if he's dumped by white IC
(see Cybercombat, p. 119).

Matrix 2.0 eliminates access and barrier IC. The new rules for
System Ratings replace the functions performed by these types
of IC
CRIPPLERS
Cripplers are proactive white IC programs that each attack
one of the decker's icon's attributes. Cripplers come in four
types acid, binder, jammer, or marker programs. Acid cripplers
attack an icon's Bod Rating. Binder cripplers attack an Icon's
Evasion Rating. Jammer cripplers attack the Sensor Rating, and
marker cripplers attack the Masking Rating
Whenever a crippler program attacks an icon, the gamemas-
ter makes an Attack Test for the host and tallies the successes (see
Cybercombat. p. 119, for details on Attack Tests). At the same
time, the decker makes an opposed test for the affected icon
attribute against a target number equal to the crippler IC's rating.
If the decker achieves a greater or equal number of successes. the
IC does no damage. Reduce the affected icon attribute by I point
for every 2 net successes the IC scores. Yes, that means I nec suc-
cess for the IC does no damage. Two successes do | point of dam-
age. four successes do 2 points, and so on.
Neither Armor not Hardening (see p. 80) protect against
cripplers
Crippler IC cannot reduce/an icon attribute below I.
Selena is on an Orange-5 system when she's attacked by Acid-4
crippler IC. The gamemaster makes an Attack Test for the IC and
achieves 4 successes.
Selena's icon has a Bod Rating 6, so she rolls 6 dice when she
makes her Bod (4) Test to resist the IC. Selena scores 2 successes-
2 fewer successes than the acid IC. As a result, Selena's Bod Rating
drops 10 5.
KILLER
Killer IC is proactive IC that causes damage to icons in cyber
combat. Alt killer IC has a Damage Code and its Power is equal
to its IC rating The Damage Level of killer IC is based on the
host's.security code, Killer IC on Blue or Green systems does
Medium damage: killer IC on Orange and Red systems does
Serious damage, For example, Killer-6 IC on an Orange host
would do OS damage. This damage rises a stage for every 2 suc
cesses achieved on the host's Attack Test, just like damage in
standard combat
If an attack from killer IC fills the Condition Monitor of a
decker the decker is dumped. Armor utility programs reduce
damage from killer IC
(Note that killer IC is classified as gray IC in SRII. However, it
does not cause permanent damage to a cyberdeck s permanent
ratings or utilities, so it is classified as white IC in Matrix 2.0 rules.i
DATA BOMB
A data bomb is reactive IC that acts as a booby map attached
to a specific idafile or remote device under the Slave sulisyy
tem Once set the data bomb remains In place, waiting and
ready to explode if & decker attempts to access whatever It is
protecting: the data bomb does not rely on the security tally for
its cue
Deckers can find a data bomb by performing an Analyze
Icon operation. The decker must make a successful System Test
against the controlling subsystem to deluse It. The defuse utility
augments this test. For example, if the bomb is on a file, the
decker must make a Computer (Files Rating - Defuse Rating) Test
to disarm it. If the bomb is on the security cameras at a corpo-
rate site, however, the decker would make a Computer (Slave
Rating - Defuse Rating) Test
Data bombs remain primed if the decker fails this test.
unless he rolls all I's. Normally, a decker can try to defuse a data
bomb as many times as necessary, though, as with any System
Test. each time the decker tries he may increase the security
tally: Successfully defusing the data bomb does not count as
crashing it. 50 do not add the bomb's rating to the security tally.
If the data bomb is successfully defused, the decker need not
suppress it.
If the decker falls to defuse a data bomb and then makes a
successful System Test to open the datafile, read or write the I/O
device or slave system: or otherwise succeeds in a test to access
the booby-trapped subsystem. the data bomb explodes A test
that fails does not set it off.ILa thiet cannor bust the maglockcion
a safe, then he can't open it to trigger the bomb inside Same
idea applies here
When a data bomb explodes. it automatically hits the per-
sona, doing (IC rating)M damage which the icon resists normal:
ly. Armor utilities reduce the Power of the damage as usual The
"explosion" also adds the IC's rating to the security tally. The
decker can avoid increasing the security tally by spending . point
cof his Detection Factor to suppress the IC
Scaramouche ghosts up to a file full of, he hopes, paydata. It the
file is the one he wants, it is likely protected somehow, so
Scaramouche runs an Analyze Icon op on it. Yup. figgers, Scrambled
AND with a data bomb attached.
Scaramouche makes a Files Test because the bomb is on a file.
Scaramouche has invaded a Green-5 host with Files-11, and the data
bomb is rated 6. Scaramouche risks a few seconds to swap Defuse-5
into active memory and upload it. This lets him roll against a Target
Number of 11 (Files Rating) - 5 (Defuse Utility Rating), for a total of
6. He scores 1 success, but the Security Test scores 2. The gamemas-
ter smirks and tells him it ain't good enough. The data bomb is not
detused
Sweating a bit. Scaramouche rolls again, getting 2 successes. But
the host scores 3, so the data bomb is still active. By now.
Scaramouche figures he's been doing well on his tests, so these
repeated failures mean the host is scoring lots of successes and
jacking up the security tally in a real nasty fashion.
Scaramouche decides to drop subtlety and rips open the datafile.
Since he has a Browse-8 program, he passes the test handily, and so
the bomb goes off in his virtual tace.
Scaramouche takes a GM hit. He has Armor-4, so he rolls Bod 10
resist the damage against a Target Number of 2, and stages down the
damage to L. He decides to use a point of Detection Factor to sup-
press the IC to keep the security tally from going up another 6 points.

PROBE
Probe IC is reactive IC that conducts additional Interroga-
tions of data packets and program requests for computer
resources. Probe IC helps detect any operations performed by
unauthorized programs.
For a probe-equipped system, the gamemaster makes a
Probe Test against a decker's Detection Factor every time the
decker makes a System Test. Add any successes from the Probe
Test to the decker's security tally.
SCRAMBLE
Scramble IC is reactive IC used to protect elements of a
host's Access, Files. or Slave subsystems, Scramble IC can be
programmed to protect a specific component of a subsystem or
the entire subsystem. For example, scramble IC can protect an
Individual data file, a datastore, or all the Files functions on a
host-Including faxprinter output and dedicated terminals.
Similarly, scramble IC on an Access subsystem can oppose log-
ons from specific entry points, such as public grids and dedicat-
ed workstations, or all logons. On a Slave subsystem, scramble
IC can defend specific remote devices or all devices connected
to the subsystem.
Scramble IC comes In two varieties: exploding and poison.
Exploding IC programs are linked to data bombs. If a decker
decrypts or crashes exploding IC before defusing the bomb
boom! Poison IC programs destroy the data under their care if
they detect intruders. Generally, organizations use poison IC only
on extremely sensitive data which they have backed up off the
Matrix. If the decker tries to decrypt poison IC and fails, the
gamemaster makes a Poison Test against a target number equal
to the decker's Computer skill. If the test falls, the decker has
managed to suppress the poison IC's destruct code. If the rest
succeeds, the data is destroyed, Poison IC reacts the same way.
on each action of a cybercombat attack against it.
Deckers may use specific system operations to defeat
scramble IC, all of which can be augmented by the decryption
utility program (see System Operations, p. 108), Decrypting
scramble IC does not add to the decker's security tally. Deckers
can use attack programs to crash scramble IC, but doing so will
increase the decker's security tally unless he suppresses the
scramble IC.
TAR BABY
Tar baby is reactive IC that attempts to crash deckers" utility
programs, specifically, operational utilities used in System Tests
and any program a decker executes for a specific purpose. Tar
baby IC does not attack completely passive utilities such as
armor and sleaze programs.
Whenever a decker uses one of the trigger utilities, the
gamemaster makes an opposed test between the two programs.
Make the Tar Baby Test against a target number equal to the util-
Ity program's rating, Make the Utility Test against a target num-
ber equal to the tar baby IC's rating.
If the tar baby wins the opposed test, it crashes both Itself
and the utility program. Tar baby IC does not increase the deck-
er's security tally when it crashes this way. The decker has to
load a fresh copy of the utility program with a Swap Memory
operation,
If the utility wins the opposed test, it remains safe and the
gamemaster makes a secret Sensor Test to determine if the deck-
er notices the tar baby IC (see Locating IC. p. 40).
Tar baby IC can be placed in a construct, party IC. or used
with trap IC. In these cases, only utilities used against the con-
struct, party, or trap IC are vulnerable. However, the Tar Baby
Test modifies its target number by -2. Once the tar baby IC crash-
es. it is out of that construct- It doesn't reappear, Of course, the
construct could contain multiple tar baby programs.

Note that tar baby IC is classified as white IC under Matrix
2.0 rules, because it does not permanently affect the utility pro-
grams it attacks.
Selena is on a run when she performs a system operation using
Analyze-6. The utility triggers a Tar Baby-8 program that makes a grab
at the utility. The gamemaster makes a Tar Baby (6) Test for the IC and
an Analyze (8) Test for the analyze program. The Tar Baby Test
achieves more net successes, and so both the IC and the utility crash.
GRAY IC
Gray IC programs attack a decker's cyberdeck and utilities
directly, Any damage caused by a gray IC attack permanently
affects the deck's ratings. Damaged chips and other components
must be replaced to restore the deck's original ratings.
BLASTER
Blaster IC is proactive IC that attacks in cybercombat in the
same manner as killer IC (see Killer, p. 41). Armor reduces dam-
age from blaster attacks. However, blaster IC may permanently
damage a decker's cyberdeck MPCP if It crashes his icon. If
blaster IC dumps a decker, make a Blaster Test against a target
number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating. Hardening increases
the target number but armor does not. Reduce the MPCP Rating
by 1 point for every 2 successes on the Blaster Test. Note that the
decker may need to crank down his persona programs if his deck
takes damage, because their total ratings may not exceed the
deck's MPCP Rating multiplied by 3 (see Cyberdecks. p. 84).
It's not Selesa's day. The program that blew her off the Matrix was-
w't just kiffer as she'd hoped-it was a Blaster-6 program.
Solens's deck has MPCP-6 and Hardening-2, so the gamemaster
makes a Blaster (8) Test. The test produces two successes, so
Solona's MPCP Rating is permanently reduced to 5. If she goes on a
run before replacing it, she'll have to adjust her persona programs to
make sure their total ratings don't exceed 15.
RIPPERS
Ripper IC is a gray version of crippler IC. These proactive IC
attack In the same manner (see Cripplers, p. 41), but whenever
a ripper program damages an icon, make a Ripper Test against a
target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating. Hardening
Increases the target number. Reduce the rating of the deck's per-
sona chip by 1 for each success on the test. Replacing the per-
sona chip is the only way to restore this damage.
Four different types of ripper IC exist: acid-rip, bind-rip. jam-
rip, and mark-rip. Acid-rip, also known as "bodstripper," "siz-
zier," or "peeler." attacks the deck's Bod Rating. Bind-rip. also
known as "gluefoot." "mummy," or "flypaper." attacks the
Evasion Rating. Jam-rip, also known as "blinder," "gouger." or
"stick," attacks the Sensor Rating, Mark-rip. also called "scream-
er," "paint." or "tag," attacks the Masking Rating.
SPARKY
The proactive IC called sparky IC attacks in the same man-
ner as blaster IC (see Blaster), However, if sparky IC crashes the
persona, it causes an overload in the deck's power supply that
feeds random jolts of electricity to the MPCP and the decker's
brain. Results can range from a little impromptu electroshock
therapy to a killing jolt. This is dark gray IC Indeed-bordering on
black-but because it is not designed to deliberately cause phys-
ical trauma, it is technically considered non-lethal.
Whenever sparky IC crashes a persona, make a Sparky Test
against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating + Z.
Hardening increases the target number, Reduce the MPCP Rating
by 1 point for every 2 successes of the Sparky Test. A sparky
attack also causes (IC Rating)M damage to the decker, Stage the
Damage up one level for every 2 successes on the Sparky Test.
The decker resists this damage as he would any other. Hardening
reduces the Power of the damage.
HeadCrash gets trashed off the nets by a Sparky-8 program. The
Sparky Test yields 2 successes. That melts 1 point off the MPCP right
away. It also raises the Damage Level to HeadCrash from BM to BS.
Head's meatbod has a Body Rating 4 and his deck has Hardening-1. He
rolls a Damage Resistance Test: 4 dice (his Body) against a target
number of 5 (Sparky Rating of 6 - 1 for Hardening). His test produces
1 success, which does not stage down the damage. Can you say ZAP ?!
TAR PIT
The reactive IC known as tar pit IC operates and attacks in the
same manner as tar baby IC (see Tar Baby, p. 42). However, if tar
pit IC trashes a utility online, it also injects the deck with viral code
that corrupts all copies of the program in the deck's active and
storage memories. Unless the decker has a backup copy of the util-
ity stashed in offline memory, he's lost it for good, And even if he
has a backup, he can't get at it for the rest of the run.
When tar pit IC trashes a program, make a Tar Pit Test
against a target number equal to the deck's MPCP Rating.
Hardening increases the target number. If the test produces no
successes, the viral code is defeated and the tar pit IC has the
same effect as the tar baby program, so the decker can reload his
utility with a Swap Memory operation, If the Tar Pit Test produces
any successes, however, the IC corrupts all copies of the program
stored on the deck. The decker cannot get the utility back until
he jacks out and reloads the utility from a source outside his deck
(from a storage chip, most likely).
WORMS
Worms are reactive virus programs used to booby trap subsys-
tems. Any System Test against a subsystem infected with worm IC
prompts the worm to infect the MPCP of a decker's cyberdeck.
Deckers can detect worm IC programs by performing
Analyze Subsystem operations, However, if a worm inhabits the
subsystem, it tries to infect the decker when he analyzes it.

Deckers can destroy worms by performing Disinfect opera-
tions or by cybercombat. However, if an attempt to destroy a
worm fails, the worm can Infect the deck's MPCP. Worms have
no IC Rating as such, so destroying one by either means does not
affect the security tally.
To determine whether a worm successfully infects a deck's
MPCP. make a test using the Security Value of the host against a
target number equal to the MPCP Rating of the deck. On | suc-
cess, the worm has invaded the MPCP. If the deck has
Hardening, this test must result in a number of successes greater
than the deck's Hardening to infect the MPCP.
Once a worm Infects an MPCP, it cannot be erased. The
decker has to cook a whole new MPCP chip. A worm Infection
cannot be detected unless a decker actively tests for it, a task
requiring Computer skill (or an appropriate Hardware or B/R skill)
and a Base Time of 10 hours. The decker may run the test perl-
odically, as often as caution-or paranoia-dictates, or if he
experiences problems that suggest the presence of a worm.
Worm IC v1.0 was developed as a Matrix weapon by Lone
Star's GridSec programmers, More recent worm programs-
dataworm and deathworm-have Increased dramatically the
dangers presented by worm IC.
Dataworms
Dataworms log information about a decker's runs and report
it to their owners. Each time a dataworm-infected deck logs onto
a grid, roll ID6. On a result of 1, the dataworm tries to send a
report chock full of incriminating evidence to some specified
delivery address. At the same time, make a Sensor (8) Test for
the decker. If the test falls, he doesn't even know the system has
a dataworm, If the test succeeds, the decker notices the data-
worm report and may engage it in cybercombat to destroy it
before it gets away. In cybercombat, dataworm reports always
act as standard icons with 3D6 Initiative and an effective Evasion
Rating of 8. They possess no offensive capabilities, but will
maneuver to Evade Detection (see Cybercombat, p. 119, for a
complete treatment of these concepts).
The effects of dataworm reports depend on the events in
the adventure. If the decker gets arrested, the reports serve as
admissible evidence against him, even if he was not arrested for
Matrix crimes. If the decker uses his deck in a detectable pattern,
the dataworm will report it. This allows a gamemaster to rea-
sonably give non-player characters the e-mail names and
addresses the decker uses, the identities of people with whom
he communicates, and the BBSs he logs on to-as long as he
employed that specific data while using the infected deck.
Deathworms
A deathworm Infection increases a deck's target numbers
by 2 in cybercombat. This increase applies to all Attack and
Resistance tests made by the decker. If the deck picks up multi-
ple deathworm infections, each additional worm increases the
target numbers by an additional +1.

Tapeworms
Tapeworms erase files downloaded onto a deck. To determine
how much data the tapeworm deletes, roll ID6 - 1 at the end of
each run. Subtract the result from any Paydata Points the decker
downloaded on the run. If the decker downloaded a specific datafile
to obtain information, roll 1D6. On a result of 5 or 6, the tapeworm
corrupts the needed information and renders it irretrievable.
Once a tapeworm infects a deck's MPCP, it continues to
affect all the deck's downloads in this manner until the decker
replaces the chip.
TRACE IC
Trace IC is a hybrid of white and gray IC programs. Basically.
trace IC works in two distinct stages: the hunt cycle and the loca-
tion cycle.
During the hunt cycle, trace IC tries to get a fix on the deck-
er's datatrail. It does this by "attacking" the decker in cybercom-
bat. The target number for these Attack Tests is the decker's
Trace Factor (see below).
The location cycle is a fixed period of time, based on the num-
ber of successes the trace IC scores when it finally "hits" the decker.
The Matrix 1.0 functions of Trace & Dump and Trace & Burn
are not available in Matrix 2.0, though their effects can be dupli-
cared. Trace IC performs the functions of Matrix 1.0's Trace &
Report program. Under Matrix 2.0, a successful Trace also
enhances the effects of other IC programs.
TRACE FACTOR
The base Trace Factor is equal to the decker's current
Evasion Rating minus the trace IC's rating. Add the rating of any
camo utility the decker is running, as well as the number of
grids-LTGs, RTGs, and PLTGs-where the decker has performed
Redirect Datatrail operations during this run (see System
Operations, p. 117). In addition, apply any trace modifiers for
the decker's jackpoint (see Jackpoints, p. 28).
If using the optional bandwidth rule (see Cyberdecks, p. 90)
apply any trace modifiers for the decker's current bandwidth. The
formula, again, is actual bandwidth divided by base bandwidth,
rounded down and multiplied by -1.
Vanessa has illegally tapped into the commlines in the basement
of a low-security office building. She went to the trouble of getting
into an office building because the business service lines there give
her a Base Bandwidth of 50 Mp. Her total bandwidth at the moment is
165 Mp. That calls for -3 to the Trace Factor (165/50 = 3.3, round
down to 3, 3 x -1 = - 3).
Vanessa left Datatrail Redirects on the local LTG to hide her jack-
point and the host she is targeting. That's 2 Datatrail Redirects, for a
+2 to the Trace Factor.
Vanessa's deck is running a Camo-4 utility and has an Evasion
Rating of 9. The host is running a Trace-8 program. That leaves Vanessa
with a Trace Factor of 4.
Evasion Rating - Trace Rating + Bandwidth modifier + number of
Datatrail Redirects + Camo Rating
9-8 +(-3) +2+4=4
HUNT CYCLE
During the hunt cycle, trace IC makes Attack Tests against
the decker using Initiative and other rules for cybercombat. The
decker's Trace Factor is the target number for these tests. The
hunt cycle lasts until the trace IC achieves a successful test.
During the hunt cycle, the decker can attack the trace IC in
cybercombat and try to crash it.
Relocate utility programs are not effective during the hunt cyde.
LOCATION CYCLE
The location cycle begins as soon as the trace IC makes a
successful Attack Test against a decker. The IC immediately "dis-
appears" and becomes reactive IC.
Divide 10 turns by the number of successes achieved in the
trace IC's Attack Test. The result, rounded down, is the number
of turns the trace IC needs to complete its cycle and locate the
decker's jackpoint. During that time, the decker may attempt to
locate the IC and neutralize it by spending a Complex Action to
perform a Locate IC operation to locate trace IC. If the decker
cannot do this in time. the IC Identifies the decker's Matrix and
meatworld locations and reveals them to the host's operators.
(See Trace Effects, p. 46, for other consequences.)
For the purposes of measuring a trace IC location cycle,
Combat Turns are considered completed once they reach Phase
0. If a decker can freeze or destroy the IC before Phase 0 of a
Combat Turn. that turn is considered completed.
Crashing a trace IC program with combat code produces the
standard penalty to the decker's security tally (see Security Tally,
p. 19). Defeating trace IC with a relocate utility has no effect on
the security tally.
Vanessa is on a Red-8 host when she is attacked by a trace pra-
gram. The trace IC Attack Test produces 6 successes-ouch! Ten
divided by 6 produces 1.7, rounded down to 1. If Vanessa can't take
out the IC, it will trace her in only 1 Combat Turn!
The IC vanishes and the clock is ticking. Vanessa tries a Locate IC
operation on her last action of the present turn and finds the pro-
gram's address. She will try to beat it next turn.
DEFEATING TRACE IC
A decker can defeat a trace program three ways. During the
program's hunt cycle, the decker can attack it in cybercombat
and attempt to destroy it. During the location cycle, the decker
can run for it or use a relocate utility.
Run for It
A Graceful Logoff operation enables a decker to get away
and immediately stop the location cycle of a trace program.
However, trace IC tries to prevent this operation, so increase the
decker's target number for the operation by the IC's rating (see
System Operations, p. 114, for details).
Simply jacking out of the system will not defeat trace IC,
because jacking out leaves the comm links in the network open
for a measurable period. First, the LTG has to verify carrier signal

loss. Then It gracefully dismantles the decker's datatrail, the
same way a user-Initiated Graceful Logoff does. Just because a
decker jacks out doesn't mean his datatrail disappears in a big
puff of bits. If a decker does jack out, roll 1D6 - 1 (minimum
value is 1). The result is the number of turns the decker's data-
trail remains intact. If the die roll result equals or exceeds the
number of turns left in the trace program's location cycle, the IC
will still locate the jackpoint.
Relocate It
To use a relocate utility to defeat a trace program, a decker
must spend a Simple Action to make a Control Test (the relocate
utility reduces the target number). The gamemaster makes an
opposing Security Test for the host/grid. Any successes for the
opposing Security Test are added to the decker's security tally.
If the decker's Control Test succeeds, he successfully
"spoofs" the trace program. Its sampling algorithms are sent on
a wild goose chase. However, unless the decker keeps that trace
suppressed (see Suppressing IC, p. 40), the trace will pick up
where it left off, so the gamemaster should note how many turns
were left in the location cycle when the decker completed his
Control Test.
If the decker chooses not to keep the trace program sup-
pressed, he can use a relocate utility again any time during each
turn. If he succeeds, the trace IC remains neutralized for that
turn. If he fails, the trace program ticks one turn closer to finish-
ing its task.
Defeating a trace program with a relocate utility does not
count as crashing the IC, and so It does not add the penalty to the
security tally created by destroying the IC with an attack utility.
Vanessa has only one Combat Turn to beat the trace program. Bn
her first action, she uses the relocate utility. She has Computer-16
and is running Relocate-4. The IC is Trace-8.
Vanessa rolls 18 dice (Computer Skill) against a Target Number
of 8 (IC Rating) -4 (Relocate Rating). The host opposes this with the
usual test: Security Value (Detection Factor). Vanessa, rolling 18
dice against a Target Number of 4, scores 4 successes. The host
scores 3. Vanessa successfully blocks the trace this turn, but the
security tally goes up another 3 points.
Vanessa can either allocate a point of her Detection Factor to
keep the trace IC frozen, or can try to use the relocate utility against
it again next turn. If she fails to do either, the IC will finish tracing
her jackpoint on Phase 0 of the Combat Turn.
TRACE EFFECTS
If a trace program completes its location cycle successfully,
several things happen. First, the system records the jackpoint's
network address and physical location in Its security logs. That
means that any security assets in the meatworld monitoring the
Invaded system can initiate physical measures against the deck-
er's location (i.e., they send out the goons), More immediately
dangerous to the decker are the IC-targeting and tally-accelera-
tion bonuses that the host receives.
IC Targeting
The IC-targeting bonus reduces by | all target numbers for
Attack Tests the system's proactive IC programs make against
the decker in cybercombat.
Tally Acceleration
When the tally-acceleration bonus is in effect, add I to any
Increase to the decker's security tally. For example, if the host
scores 2 successes in a System Test, add 3 to the security tally.

Physical Measures
The physical measures triggered by a successful trace pro-
gram really depend on a large number of variables. For example,
say the trace IC has reported that the decker is tapped into a
dataline in Redmond, at such-and-such a location. The speed of a
physical response depends entirely on what resources the invad-
ed system's owners have, jurisdictional concerns (see Matrix Law.
p: 132), the location of the nearest useful assets, whether Lone
Star or any other local law-enforcement agency has been called in.
the standard Security Rating of the site, and so on.
The gamemaster may use his own discretion or dice rolls to
determine the time it takes for security assets (i.e., goons) to reach
the decker's jackpoint. If using dice rolls, consult the Security Asset
Response Times table. The result of the dice roll is the response
time in minutes. Keep in mind that all response times are simply
suggested guidelines. "Government" entries in the table assume a
UCAS setting-response times may be longer for less organized
governments and shorter for efficient, paranoid ones, Cruel
gamemasters can always determine that by some wretched mis-
fortune the corp or government in question just happens to have
a "strategic asset" (i.e., goon squad) near the scene that can reach
the decker's location In. oh, 30 seconds or so.
"On site" jackpoints refer to entry points inside a manned
location that belongs to the system's owner. For example, a
decker jacking into a government host from inside a federal
office building is on site.
TRAP TRACE
The functions of the Matrix 1.0 programs Trace & Dump or
Trace & Burn can be reproduced by combining or "trapping"
trace IC with a program that can blow the icon off the grid-such
as killer IC-or gray IC programs that attack decks directly, such
as blaster or sparky IC. Of course, trace also may be combined
with black IC to create lethal trapped trace IC.
Trapping trace IC reduces the trace program's effectiveness.
When linking trace and gray IC programs, add half the gray IC
rating to the Trace Factor of any persona targeted by the trace IC.
When linking trace and black IC programs, add the full black IC
rating to any targeted decker's Trace Factor.
See Trap IC, p. 50. for more information.
TRACE ON A GRID
Trace triggered by a grid keeps working against the decker
as long as he remains on any grid controlled by the same RTG. If
he defeats the IC on an LTG. he must keep it suppressed or keep
relocating it as long as he is on that LTG, Its parent RTG, or any
other LTG governed by that RTG (see Suppressing IC, p. 40, and
Relocate It, p. 46, for details). On the other hand, the IC loses
interest in tracking the decker once he has logged onto a host or
another RTG or PLTG.
If the trace IC has been triggered by the RTG that governs
the decker's jackpoint, or by an LTG attached to that RTG, then
the IC can immediately dump the decker once it detects his jack-
point. In such circumstances a killer-type attack is not necessary,
because the central switchers for the RTG accept control direc-
tives directly from the IC. This option is not available to a trace
originating on other grids or hosts.
BLACK IC
Black IC is a form of proactive IC that samples the command
transactions between the decker and his deck and then injects
dangerous biofeedback responses Into the deck's ASIST inter-
face. These feedback responses raise the deck's simsense signal
to the same levels as a BTL chip on overdose Intensity. As a
result, the signal may overload the decker's neural connections
and in turn render him unconscious, trigger psychological disor-
ders, brainwash him, or cause death from stroke, heart failure.
respiratory paralysis, aneurysm, or neurotransmitter autotoxicity.
And those are just a few of the possible effects.
"Cool" decks, which use weaker ASIST signals, do not pro-
duce lethal simsense signals in such situations, though deckers
using cool decks remain vulnerable to stun damage and psy-
chotropic IC. Only the most feeble, non-simsense terminals, the
so-called tortoises, provide protection against these effects. (See
ICCM, p. 86 in Cyberdecks, for more information.)
BLACH IC IN COMBAT
Black IC begins to subvert the ASIST Interface in a decker's
cyberdeck as soon as it scores a successful attack on the decker.
even if the hit does no damage. Until the IC scores that first
attack, jacking out of the Matrix is a Free Action.

After a black IC hit, the decker must spend a Complex
Action and make a successful Willpower (Black IC Rating) Test to
jack out. If the test succeeds, the decker may jack out, but the
black IC makes one more cybercombat attack against him before
the connection goes down. Black IC also makes an automatic
attack if a companion at the jackpoint pulls the plug when the
deck indicates black IC activity, or if the decker jacks out using an
ICCM biofeedback monitor (see Cyberdecks, p. 81).
LETHAL BLACH IC
Lethal black IC fights like killer IC in cybercombat. However,
successful lethal black IC attacks cause damage ro a decker and
his icon, The Damage Code for the IC depends on the Security
Code of the Host: (IC Rating) Moderate for Blue and Green sys-
tems. (IC Rating) Serious for Orange and Red ones. The Damage
Code applies to damage to both the decker and his icon.
Raise the Damage Level for every 2 successes on the IC's
Attack Test. Every time black IC hits a decker, the decker rolls
two Resistance Tests. Hardening reduces the Power of the dam-
age for these Resistance Tests. A Body Resistance Test, using his
Body Attribute, enables the decker to resist damage to his per-
son. The Hacking Pool may not be used for this test. though
Karma Pool dice may be. The decker also makes a Resistance Test
using his icon's Bod Rating to resist damage to the icon. The icon
resists damage as it resists damage from killer IC (see Killer, p.
41). and armor protects the icon normally.
The decker's Matrix connection remains Intact if the icon is
killed before the decker dies or manages to jack out. In such
cases, the IC completely dominates the decker's icon bandwidth.
Increase the effective rating of the IC by 2 (even if the optional
bandwidth rule is not in use). Of course, the decker cannot fight
back at all with his icon down. All he can do is try to jack out
before the IC kills him.
The Matrix connection automatically goes down if black IC
kills the decker. But before it turns the deck loose, the black IC
gets a shot at the MPCP, making the attack as if it were blaster
IC, with double its rating. If the black IC completely destroys the
MPCP, the IC deletes all data downloaded by the decker during
the run. It deletes any such data stored in any connected storage
memory as well, and reduces the MPCP's Rating to O.
Lethal black IC damage overflows in the same manner as
Physical damage to a Shadowrun character. Overflow damage
from lethal black IC represents Increased levels of brain damage
If the overflow is high enough, the decker may receive ine
versible damage that leaves him brain-dead even if life support
can be established. If the decker can be revived, all the rules for.
Deadly damage apply (p. 115. SRII).
If a decker is using a "cool" deck, lethal black IC acts the
same as non-lethal black IC and causes Stun damage. (Ser
Cyberdecks. p. 85, for details on "hot" and "cool" decks.)
Cybersushi, who has Body-4 and Hardening-1, is rummaging
around a Red-8 system when he runs into a black IC-10 program. The
IC attacks him and hits, scoring 2 successes on its Attack Test. We
won't worry about what happens to the icon-Cybersushi has enough
troubles of his own.

The 2 successes stage up the Damage Level from Serious (S) to
Deadly (D). Cybersushi takes a 100 hit from the IC! His Hardening
reduces the Power of the damage to 9. With only 4 Body dice,
Cybersushi is not thrilled by this benefit. He adds 4 Karma Pool dice
to the Body dice for the Resistance Test and achieves 2 successes,
which stage down the Damage Level to Serious. Close call.
Cybersushi fills in 5 boxes on his Physical Condition Monitor.
Meanwhile, the IC rips his icon into junk logics and takes complete
control of his icon bandwidth.
On its next action, the IC whacks Cybersushi again. Now his icon
is down, so the IC's rating is up 2 points, to a 12! It scores 1 success
this time, so Cybersushi has to resist 12S damage, which his
Hardening-1 reduces to 11S. Good luck, Soosh.
Permanent Effects
Any Deadly wound may produce permanent aftereffects
(see p. 113-114, SRII). This rule applies to damage caused by
black IC as well. In addition to the permanent damage listed in
SRII, these aftereffects may include neurological damage that
produces memory lapses, hallucinations, tremors, phantom pain,
migraines, or similar conditions, In the case of neurological dam-
age, the gamemaster may devise his own rules for the long-term
effects-perhaps cannibalizing the rules from Cybertechnology
for the TLE and CCSS syndromes-or permanently reduce the
decker's Intelligence Attribute by 1.
non-LETHAL BLACK IC
Non-lethal black IC functions in the same manner as lethal
black IC. with the following exceptions, First, non-lethal black IC
causes Mental, not Physical damage. Deckers resist such damage
with Willpower Tests. If damage from non-lethal black IC renders
a decker unconscious, the decker's Matrix connection is auto-
matically broken. However, the non-lethal black IC still gets a
final shot at the cyberdeck's MPCP and the data downloaded
during the run. In addition, non-lethal black IC works the same
on both "hot" and "cool" cyberdecks.
Mental damage done by non-lethal black IC can overflow
into the Physical Condition Monitor.
PSYCHOTROPIC BLACK IC
Psychotropic black IC functions in the same manner as non-
lethal black IC, with the following exceptions, When a decker
jacks out or is rendered unconscious by damage and dumped.
he makes a Willpower (Psychotropic Black IC Rating) Test to
determine if the IC program caused lasting psychological trau-
ma. Reduce the target number by 2 if the decker is using a cool
cyberdeck
If the test succeeds, the decker suffers no psychological effects.
If it fails; the IC implants its psychotropic effect in the decker's mind.
These effects may vary widely, but a few of the commonest ones are
described below. Creative gamemasters may devise numerous
delightful variations on these themes as they wish.
See Recovering from Psychotropic Effects, p. 50. for infor-
mation on recovering from the various effects of psychotropic IC.
Cyberphobia
Cyberphobia is a profound fear of the Matrix, decking, and
all related concepts. Any character afflicted with cyberphobia
must make a successful Willpower Test against the rating of the
psychotropic IC that caused the phobia before he can jack into a
system. Also, add the IC's rating to the target numbers for all
tests the character makes when decking, programming, working
with hardware, you name it. As a rule of thumb, the phobia
affects any task involving computers or the Matrix.
Drugs or spells inducing fear-free responses, tranquilizers.
and the like may reduce the phobia penalty by up to half. Adrenal
conditioners with endorphin analogues are the best bet. These
drugs are only mildly addictive, cost 25 nuyen per rating point and
are available without prescription up to a rating of 4. A dose lasts
for about a day. Once medicated or under magical treatment. a.
decker suffering from cyberphobia can begin recovering.
Judas
The so-called Judas effect is a subliminal compulsion to
betray one's self and one's colleagues. A decker suffering from
the Judas effect leaves clues, both in the Matrix and the real
world, that lead to his location or reveal the identities of his col-
leagues, An afflicted decker is not aware, however, that he is
doing this. To simulate the effects of the syndrome, the
gamemaster may simply lie about tests made to defeat trace IC
programs or increase the decker's target numbers in such tests
by a penalty equal to the rating of the psychotropic IC program
that caused the Judas effect.
The afflicted character simply performs other roleplaying
actions without any conscious awareness. For example, if some-
one were to ask the decker if he was the one who scrawled the
samural's commcode on the corporate office's front door with
hot maroon lipstick, he would really believe it when he said
"No." He'd even beat a lie-detector test. Make a secret
Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test for the character when-
ever he is about to perform a compulsive act that would betray
himself or others. If the test succeeds, he resists the compulsion.
(However, all this is subconscious and the decker has no idea
what his mind is up to.) If the test falls, the decker carries out the
compulsive act with an effective Stealth Skill Rating equal to the
rating of the psychotropic IC that Infected him. If another charac-
ter is present when the decker performs a compromising act,
make an Intelligence (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test for that char-
acter. If the test succeeds, the other character notices the deck-
er's actions. The same test applies to any character monitoring
the decker on a Matrix run or reviewing logs of his runs.
If the decker's companions detect his condition and prevent
him from acting out his compulsion, he may begin recovering
from the effects.
Matrix Mamac
A decker infected by Matrix maniac IC recovers conscious-
ness In a maniacal state of rage. He may attack persons at ran-
dom, flee in howling terror, gibber, rant-you name it. In combat.
the decker fights no-holds-barred, firing weapons full-auto if he

can. using his nastiest weapons in physical combat, and so on.
This state lasts until the decker is killed or knocked out.
However, the state resumes when the decker regains conscious-
ness. A foolishly over-kindly gamemaster may allow the character
to make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test every 24 hours
to see if the decker finally wakes up in a non-psychotic state of
total exhaustion (though the Matrix-maniac conditioning might be
designed to produce periodic maniacal states, of course).
Magic or drugs may suppress the rage and allow the char-
acter to recover. Tranq patches (p. 250, SRII) or equivalent med-
ication with a total rating equal to the psychotropic IC's rating
suppress the rage for 24 hours, whether they knock the decker
out or not. Control Thought or Control Emotion spells (p.
156-57, SRII) also can be used.
Positive-Conditioning Psychotropic IC
Positive-conditioning psychotropic IC (PCPIC), more com-
monly known as "Ilove-the-company" IC, is not truly black IC
because it does not harm the decker. PCPIC compels the decker
to jack out, rather than damaging him. Use the usual rules for
black IC, but the decker has to make a Willpower (Psychotropic
IC Rating) Test to avoid voluntarily jacking out. If the decker has
taken damage, apply a target modifier based on the character's
Damage Level (+1 for Light damage, +2 for Moderate damage,
+3 for Serious, and +5 for Deadly). The character repeats the test
every turn after the IC hits, so it's only a matter of time before
the decker is forced out of the system.
Once the decker has jacked out, he may make a Willpower
(Psychotropic IC Rating) Test to negate all subsequent effects of
PCPIC.
If the test falls, apply a +2 target modifier to all tests the
decker makes when he performs actions that might harm what
he perceives as the best interests of the company or other group
or individual that employed the psychotropic IC. This involves
not just Matrix actions ("steal data from them? Never!") but any-
thing else ("Help you break in and steal hard copy documents
from that corporation? I'd rather shoot my granny.") The decker
may make a Willpower (Psychotropic IC Rating) Test to avoid this
penalty on each occasion,
For actions that normally do not require a test (such as
deciding to Infiltrate the company's premises illegally), the deck-
er must make tests using a relevant Attribute (usually Willpower)
against a Target Number 6.
Corporate programmers with a sense of humor have been
known to Include more positive elements in PCPIC as well. These
PCPIC programs not only make the decker reluctant to partici-
pate in acts against the company, but impel him to buy their
products. Honestly.
PCPIC may not be part of any party IC in combination with
any other form of black IC.
RECOVERING FROM PSYCHOTROPIC EFFECTS
Characters may recover from psychotropic IC effects by
making Willpower Tests against the rating of the psychotropic IC
program that infected them. A character afflicted with the Matrix
maniac effect must make the test dally. For other effects, charac-
ters repeat the test weekly. If the decker is under appropriate
medication or magical treatment, reduce the target number by
1. If under intensive psychotherapy, which requires the
Hospitalized Lifestyle, reduce the target number by 2 (medica-
tion is part of therapy, so these bonuses are not cumulative). If
kept under maintained, locked, quickened, or other spells with
the desired effect, reduce the target number by an additional I.
Recovery from PCPIC is more difficult because it involves
aversive counter-conditioning (i.e., the decker has to be condi-
tioned with graphic images showing the corporation to be utter
bastards, despoiling the environment, murdering children, and
the like). Raise the target number for these tests by 1 to reflect
the unpleasantness of the procedure.
IC DEFENSIVE OPTIONS
Any IC program may be fitted with three defensive options:
armor, shield, and shift. Shield and shift defenses are incompatible
with each other, though both are compatible with the armor option.
ARMOR DEFENSE
Armor defense reduces by 2 the Power of any attack against
the protected IC, For example, armored IC attacked by an
Attack-6M utility would make its Resistance Test against a Target
Number 4.
SHIELD DEFENSE
The shield defense adds a -2 target modifier to all tests
decker must make to hit the protected IC in cybercombat.
Combat utilities with the penetration option defeat IC
shield defense automatically and do not receive the +2 penalty
However, the shield defense is extra-effective against program
with the chaser option, which must add a +4 modifier to the tal
get number.
SHIFT DEFENSE
The shift defense enables an IC program to "dodge" incom
ing attacks. It adds a +2 target modifier to all tests a decker mu
make to hit the protected IC in cybercombat.
Combat utilities with the chaser option defeat the sh
defense automatically and do not receive the +2 penalty
However, the shift option is extra-effective against program
with the penetration option, which must add a +4 modifier to
target number.
TRAP IC
Trap IC is IC that is linked to gray or black IC. Any reactla
white, or trace IC program can be used as trap IC, If trap IC
destroyed in cybercombat (or in the case of trace, if it finishes !!
location cycle successfully) it triggers the hidden gray or blad !!

If the decker neutralizes the trap IC without destroying it,
It does not trigger the gray or black IC, which remains hidden
and Inactive.
Applications, files, and slave remotes can be fitted with hid-
den gray or black IC programs as well. The decker triggers these
programs when he crashes the protected icons or falls a System
Test made to control the icon. The trapped data bomb is a partic
ularly nasty variation of this arrangement. If a decker's test against
the booby-trapped subsystem fails, the trap IC goes after him and
detonates its data bomb if it locates him. Only a successful Defuse
Test enables a decker to destroy both IC programs.
A decker can detect trap IC by performing an Analyze IC
operation against the white IC or an Analyze Icon operation in
the case of some other Matrix entity fitted with trap IC.
OPTIONAL RULES
The following optional rules describe particularly lethal varl-
ations of IC and suggest ways to combine types of IC Into even
more threatening gamemaster tools,
CASCADING IC
When cascading IC misses a decker in cybercombat or falls
to damage a decker when It scores a hit. it allocates more sys-
tem resources to future attacks. Any proactive IC program may
be programmed to cascade.
If cascading IC misses on an attack, Increase the Security
Value used for its attacks by 1 for each subsequent Attack Test.
This increase is cumulative- each time a test fails, add an addi
tional point to the Security Value.
If the IC program attacks successfully but the decker resists
all of the damage or otherwise neutralizes the IC's effect.
Increase the IC's rating by | for subsequent attacks, These
increases are also cumulative.
The maximum Increase depends on the Security Code of the
system, as shown on the Cascading IC Table.
The optional cascading IC rule makes IC more dangerous for
deckers, However, deckers may minimize its effects by quickly
suppressing IC programs as they encounter them (see
Suppressing IC. p. 40),
CASCADING IC TABLE
System Security Code
Maximum Increase
Blue
Green
25 percent of original rating or 2.
whichever Is higher.
Orange
50 percent of original rating or 3.
whichever is higher.
Red
100 percent of original rating or 4,
whichever Is higher
FastJack is under attack by a cascading Killer-5 program on a
Green-6 host. Its first Attack Test uses 6 dice. The test falls, and so
the next time it makes an Attack Test it rolls 7 dice. If the test falls
again, the value rises to 8-which represents a 25-percent increase
over its original rating, and so its maximum increase.
Now, let's say the IC hits Jack but he red
es his damage to noth-
ing. The IC's rating, which is the Power
damage, would start to
cascade. Because the IC is a Killer-5 pr
on a Green host, its rat-
ing may increase by 2.
So, if FastJack is "lucky" in early exchanges with the IC program,
he will eventually find himself facing the equivalent of Killer-7 on a
Green-8 host!

EXPERT IC
In Matrix 2.0, expert IC may be used to increase the attack
rating or damage-resistance rating capabilities of proactive IC
programs and Mattix constructs (both of these ratings are based
on the host/grid's Security Value-see IC Ratings, p. 40).
However, increasing one rating reduces the other automatically.
For example, using the expert modification to increase the attack
rating of an IC program by 3 would reduce the program's dam-
age resistance rating by 3. The expert modification may Increase
or decrease ratings by 1 to 3 points,
For an Expert Offense-2/Blaster-5 IC program on a Red-6
host, the Attack Test would use 8 dice (Security Value of 6 +
expert modification of 2). The gamemaster would roll only 4 dice
for any Damage Resistance Tests made for the IC,
CONSTRUCTS
A construct is a gamemaster-designed icon that consists of
two or more IC programs combined in a Matrix "critter.
Constructs should display cunning, using nasty tricks and
tactical smarts. To reflect this, constructs may have Threat Ratings
(p. 187, SRII). On Green systems, construct Threat Ratings may
not exceed 1. On Orange systems, these Threat Ratings may not
exceed 2. On Red systems, Threat Ratings may not exceed 3.
Constructs on Blue systems may not have Threat Ratings. Threat
dice may be added to all tests except Initiative rolls.
Threat Ratings may make constructs too dangerous for sat-
isfying game play, especially with beginning deckers, and 50
gamemasters may skip giving constructs Threat Ratings in their
games. On the other hand, even beginning deckers should
have the sense not to get into systems that are likely to contain
constructs.
Building Constructs
Constructs provide an excellent way to create protected
forms of reactive IC. To do so, simply pair a reactive form of IC
with a proactive form. Any IC program may be included in a con-
struct.
A construct's capacity is equal to twice the Security Value of
the IC's parent host or grid. The combined ratings of the IC pro-
grams in the construct may not exceed its capacity. No single IC
program may have a rating greater than two-thirds the
host/grid's Security Value, rounded up. So, on a host with a
Security Value 8, a construct can hold IC programs with com-
bined ratings of 16 points. No single program in the construct
can exceed 6, which is two-thirds of 8, rounded up.
Gray IC programs consume an additional point of capacity.
For example, a Blaster-4 would use 5 points of a construct's capac-
Ity. Black IC uses 2 extra points. Constructs may be assigned
armor, shield, and shift defensive options as well (see IC
Defensive Options, p. 50). Each option selected uses up 2 points
of the construct's capacity. So, If a construct with a capacity of 16
was fitted with the armor and shift options, the construct would
have 12 points left over to divide among IC programs.
Constructs in Cybercombat
Constructs are always proactive, because building a con-
struct with no proactive components offers no advantage.
A construct can attack any available target In cybercombat,
using any one of its available programs. Resolve attacks against
the construct as if it were a single icon. A construct has a single
Condition Monitor. Fill that in, and the whole thing crashes-alt
irs programs stop running
As with individual IC programs, constructs use the
host/grid's Security Value when making Attack Tests and
Damage Resistance Tests. The ratings of the individual IC pro-
grams are used to determine their effects only.
Constructs can use combat maneuvers as well (see
Cybercombat, p. 121). When designing a construct, the
gamemaster should determine its basic combat approach: stand-
up-and-slug; sneaky. popping in and out of detection; going for
killer positions in Matrix dogfights; and so on, Some corps tend
to consistently choose certain behaviors for their constructs, Ares
constructs use lots of maneuvering and tactical trickery.
Aztechnology loads its constructs with powerful IC programs
designed to overcome opposition by brute force.
A construct's Initiative is based on the lowest rating of all its
component IC programs. (See Cybercombat, p. 120, for details.)
PARTY IC
Party IC consists of a cluster of independent programs that
work cooperatively to destroy the decker. Unlike constructs, the
component programs of a party IC cluster do not form a single
icon. A decker dealing with a three-piece cluster of party IC
would have to defeat each piece separately, However, party IC
differs from individual pieces of IC in several ways,
First, any proactive IC program in a party IC cluster suffers a
penalty on its Attack Tests because the host is dividing its atten-
tion among the programs. Increase the target number for all
Attack Tests made by party IC programs by the number of pro-
grams contained in the party IC cluster.
Second, party IC programs are harder to hit because they
surround the decker's processing space with rapidly shifting tar-
get addresses. Increase the decker's target number to hit any
component program in the party cluster by the number of IC pro-
grams in the party cluster. Combat utilities with the area effect
option defeat this feature, however, and the penalty does not
apply to tests made with such utilities.
These modifiers continue to apply even if the decker crash-
es one of the component programs of the party IC.
Building Party IC
Every party IC cluster has a capacity equal to twice the
host/grid's Security Value: The combined ratings of the party
cluster's component IC programs may not exceed this capacity.
As with constructs, treat the capacity as a pool of points used to
"buy" IC programs,
The maximum number of components in a party IC cluster is
equal to half the Security Value. Non-IC component programs
may have any rating.

All the options available for individual IC programs are avail-
able for party IC. Each option added to a party IC cluster con-
sumes 1 point of the cluster's capacity.
HOST SHUTDOWN
If IC programs and constructs fall to stop an intruder, a host
computer may shut Itself down completely to dump the decker.
Unlike a decker-Initiated Crash Host operation, a host shutdown
Involves a number of steps, such as gracefully terminating run-
ning programs, transferring controls to back-up systems, closing
files to avoid damage, and so on.
Hosts begin the shutdown procedure when the decker
reaches a predetermined Security Tally threshold. (Typical
thresholds for different hosts appear in Matrix Hot Spots. p.
149). When the shutdown threshold of a host is reached, the
gamemaster rolls 1D6 for every 2 points, or fraction thereof, of
the host's Security Value. For example. the gamemaster would
roll ID6 for a host with a Security Value of 1 or 2, 2D6 for a host
with a Security Value of 3 or 4, and so on. The result of the roll
indicates the number of Combat Turns the host's shutdown
sequence will last. In addition, the gamemaster should roll
ID6/2. rounding fractions up. The result of this roll indicates the
final warning"turn.
Once the shutdown sequence begins, make a secret Sensor
Test for each decker in the system. Make these tests at the end
of each Combat Turn against a target number equal to the num-
ber of Combat Turns remaining in the shutdown, sequence.
Continue the tests for each decker until one succeeds. At that
point, that decker knows that the host Is in shutdown mode, but
not when it will go
Whether or not deckers have detected the shutdown.
Inform all deckers in the system that the shutdown sequence
Is in progress when the sequence reaches the final warning
turn. and tell the deckers how many turns remain before final
shutdown.
The host actually shuts itself off at the end of the last Combat
Turn in the sequence. Any decker online when the host shuts
down is dumped and may suffer Dump Shock as a result. All
frames and other programs the decker has running crash.
Ongoing and monitored operations (see System Operations, p.
I 10) terminate as well,

This particular configuration is designed for execution when
intrusion is suspected but not confirmed. The killer program is
activated in the following circumstances:
·Tar baby captures a utility.
·The trace completes its location cycle and isolates an illegal
jackpoint. In that event, the killer program becomes aggressive,
applying the -1 combat efficiency parameter to its attack instruc-
tions, due to the lock on the intruder icon's jackpoint.
·A relocate program is used on the trace component.
Naturally, as cooperative elements in a program constella-
tion, the Level 6 and 8 implementations suffer a +3.0 adjustment
to success probabilities, and the Level 10 version suffers a +4.0
adjustment. Against intruding Icons on Orange-to-Red-range
security systems, these inefficiencies are compensated for by
baseline success probabilities. We project a target value of 7 to
9 on a Red-10 mainframe, for example, though low-trace intru-
sion routines would have a proportionately greater chance of
avoiding detection.

Iconography
The constellation is programmed to take its sensory cues
from the operating system, defaulting to UMS in the absence of
specific sculpture code. The initial commercial implementation
was in a medieval Japanese metaphor, with the trace component
manifesting as a hunting falcon, circling throughout the hunting
and location cycles and swooping when it verifies the jackpoint's
address. The killer program was an armored samurai guard, and
the probe program appeared as a mounted daimyo watching the
falcon from a hillside In the Security Value 10 implementation
the tar baby program manifested as a hidden ninja icon, which
leapt Into view and tried to snatch away utility icons from the
intruding deckers.

Psychotropic implantation was oriented toward engendering
ongoing conditioning toward corporate imagery, and the data

yst
ms increasingly common Some system-des
ps still work in the UMS, but they are
a dying breed.
In game terms, the Matrix 1.0 system layouts required detailed mapping Deckers saw the
specifics of the local Matrix or private matrices as they went from node to node, Under Matrix
2.0, no fixed maps exist for hosts. When speed is of the essence, the gamemaster and players
can simply declare their actions, System Tests, IC attacks, and other pleasantries without con-
sidering the appearance of the Matrix at all.

SYSTEM ACCESS NODES
In Matrix 2.0, system-access nodes (SANs) connect host
computers to grids and to each other, just as they did in Matrix
1.0. When a decker performs a Logon to Host operation from
the grid or from a dedicated host connection, he enters the SAN
icon for the host he is invading. The gamemaster needs to
decide-in advance or on the fly-to which LTG a host with open
access is attached. Similarly, If the host can only be accessed
from a PLTG or via host-host access, then the gamemaster needs
to make that choice.
(See p. 169, SRII, for more guidelines on these rules.)
SECURITY SHEAVES
A security sheaf describes the security measures in place on
a host or grid as well as how the host/grid reacts to intruders.
Quite simply, a sheaf consists of a list of trigger steps. These
steps represent security tally thresholds. As a decker's security
tally reaches each trigger step, the system activates one or more
IC programs. Trigger steps also activate the various alert levels in
a system. The alert status of the system, in turn, affects the types
of IC programs the system activates.
The security code of the host/grid determines the frequency
of trigger steps in a system, and the gamemaster determines the
events activated by each trigger step. Gamemasters may use their
own discretion or random generation to determine these events.
TRIGGER STEPS
As noted above, trigger steps consist of specific security
tally numbers; Whenever the security tally of a decker reaches or
exceeds one of a system's trigger steps, the system automati-
cally activates one or more security measures, such as IC pro-
grams or alerts. Low-security systems, such as Blue hosts, main-
tain few trigger steps-as a result, they have fewer IC programs
and other security measures. High-security systems, such as Red
hosts, set trigger steps in small increments, and so they have
more IC programs and security measures.
A system's security sheaf lists the system's trigger steps and
indicates the events triggered at each step. The Sample Security
Sheaf Table depicts a system that activates a Probe-5 IC program
when a decker's security tally reaches 3. When a decker's security
tally reaches 7, the system activates a Trace-7 IC program, and so on.

Gamemasters may assign system trigger steps at their own
discretion or generate them randomly. If generating trigger steps
using dice rolls, roll ID6 + 2 and apply the appropriate modifier
from the Trigger Step Table to the roll result, based on the sys-
tem security code.
To create a high-security system, simply use the lowest
value in the security-code range when determining the system's
trigger steps. For more mild-mannered systems, use the highest
values when setting the steps.
For example, a low-security Blue host might have the fol-
lowing trigger steps: 6, 12, 19, 24. 31, 36, 42, and so on.

Multiple Triggers
If a decker performs several actions on a system that togett-
er add a large number of points to his security tally all at once
the increase may cover two or more trigger steps, In this case.
the indicated events for ALL the triggered steps that have been
reached or exceeded occur at once (otherwise known as "the
drek hits the power supply").
ALERTS
After determining the intervals of the trigger steps for a sy
tem, the gamemaster chooses the IC programs and security
measures activated by each trigger step, In order to determin
an appropriate level of response for each trigger, however, the
gamemaster must first determine the timing of the system alem
All systems have three alert statuses-no alert, passur
alert, and active alert. The normal status for all systems is my
alert. Specific trigger steps activate passive and active alerts,
turn, the alert status of a system determines the types of IC pro
grams that go into action at the system's trigger steps.
No Alert
Generally, trigger steps under a no-alert status activate rex
tive IC or trace IC programs.
Passive Alert
In a typical security sheaf, the third or fourth trigger s
activates a passive alert.

Passive alert means that a system suspects an intruder has
Invaded it, but is not 100 percent certain, Under passive-alert
status, trigger steps typically activate proactive white or gray IC
programs. Reactive IC tends to be trapped or part of a party IC
cluster or combat-capable construct.
When a system goes on passive alert status, Increase all
Subsystem Ratings by 2.
Active Alert
A typical system goes on active-alert status on the second
or third trigger step after the system goes to passive alert, Active
alert means the system has verified the presence of an illegal
Icon.
Under active-alert status, trigger steps typically activate
proactive and sometimes black IC programs. Trigger steps may
also activate corporate or law-enforcement deckers in the sys-
tern, and the system console operators may initiate a system
shutdown.
Once a system reaches active-alert status, running away and
sneaking back into the system become much more difficult for
Illegal deckers. Security personnel know that someone has been
snooping around, and the system managers remain particularly
vigilant for some time to come. This will lead to a very slow host
reset (see Host Reset, p. 65).
RANDOM IC ALLOCATION
The following tables provide a system for using dice rolls to
randomly generate IC programs for the trigger steps of a securi-
ty sheaf. Gamemasters who choose not to use the random-gen-
eration system may still find these tables useful as guidelines for
allocating IC programs. Table entries for low dice roll results can
be used for relatively easy systems and entries for higher dice
rolls used for more secure, hostile systems with data really worth
protecting
Special pieces of nastiness (notably worms) do not appear in
the tables. The gamemaster should use these as special features
of vicious systems that provide stiff challenges to deckers.
To use the random-generation system, first roll 1D6 for each
trigger step and consult the appropriate column of the Alert
Table. At the No Alert and Passive Alert levels, add the number
of trigger steps that have already been passed at that alert level
to the roll result. If the result indicates a type of IC-such as
Reactive White, Proactive Gray, or Black-proceed to the appro-
priate IC table to determine the IC program at the trigger step, If
the result indicates a move to a higher alert level, for the next die
roll result consult the column for the higher alert.
After rolling on the Alert Table, move to the appropriate IC
table. Roll ID6 or 2D6. as indicated on the IC Table, to determine
the specific IC program assigned to the trigger step. After deter-
mining the program, roll on the IC Rating Table to determine the
rating of the IC program. Then consult the IC Options and IC
Delenses tables and make the indicated dice rolls to determine
the options and defenses the IC program carries.

Constructs and Party IC
Under a no-alert or passive alert status, constructs and party
IC clusters typically include trace or probe programs, with com-
bat IC or a tar program to provide cover. Under active-alert sta-
tus, constructs and party clusters usually carry substantial offer
sive IC programs. (See Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 52, for
more information on constructs and party IC.)

prove especially useful when a player-decker invades a system
unexpectedly during a game.
For example, say that john invades a host rated Orange-
7/11/14/13/14/13, Samantha, the gamemaster, has not pre-
pared a security sheaf for the system. so she rolls ID6 + 2 with
a result of 1. She consults the Trigger Step Table, which indicates
a +2 modifier for a result of I on an Orange system. Now she
knows that the first trigger step for the system is 3.
john logs on, racking up 2 points to his security tally in the
process, then fails an Index Test, which raises his security tally to
4-past the trigger step. Time for something to happen, so
Samantha rolls 1D6 for a result of 4. She consults the Alert Table;
no alert is in effect on the system, so this means John encounters
proactive white IC. Samantha consults the Proactive White IC
Table, rolls 2D6, and achieves a 7-that means the IC is a killer
program.
Next she goes to the IC Ratings Table and again rolls 2D6.
for an 8. The system has a Security Value of 7, so that means the
killer IC has a Rating of 8. Now Samantha rolls 2D6 on the IC
Defenses Table and scores a 7, so no special defense is in play.
However, she rolls a 12 on the IC Options Table. Bad news for
John, he's just run into a Cascading Killer-8 IC program.
John crashes the IC in cybercombat, Samantha rolls again
and consults the Alert Table to determine when the next trigger
step occurs. Her ID6 + 2 roll yields a 2. She adds the +I modi-
fier for Orange systems and determines that the next trigger step
is 6 (3 + the previous trigger step).
On the next turn, John runs into real problems and his secu-
fity tally rises to 9. This is 3 points past the next trigger step, so
Samantha rolls on the Trigger Step Table again to determine if he
has triggered two steps. She rolls 1D6 + 2 and gets a 1. She adds
the +1 modifier for Orange systems and comes up with a 2. That
sets a trigger step at 8. Between the first trigger step and his cur-
rent security tally. John passed two trigger steps, at 6 and 8,
CAVEATS
Sometimes the random-generation system will produce a
result that flunks a reality check. For example, a host won't
launch a trace program if it has already located the decker's jack-
point. A mom-and-pop Blue host won't have black IC, Or the
decker might not have any chance at all against the IC the tables
summon up (assuming that this bothers the gamemaster), In
these and other cases, the gamemaster may modify the results
as he sees fit.
Gamemasters may also wish to adjust randomly determined
IC ratings to better match the decker's defensive resources, The
decker uses the rating of an IC program as his target number for
Damage Resistance Tests when taking damage from IC, so the
gamemaster needs to consider how the decker's defenses will
change the "raw" IC rating. Once armor or similar persona
defenses reduce the target numbers for the decker's Damage
Resistance Tests, he could easily take 2 or 3 points of damage
and survive. Results of 4 or 5 are more difficult to survive, and a
result of 6 virtually guarantees the decker will take significant, if
not fatal, damage
HOST RESET
If a decker logs on to a host, raises nine kinds of havoc, jacks
the host up to within a hair of shutting down and then logs off.
he can't expect to hook back into that computer five minutes
later and find that all is forgiven and forgotten. Undoubtedly, the
host will still be running IC programs and other security mea-
sures. Before jacking back in. the decker will want to wait until
the host "decides" to reduce its alert level, deactivate running IC
programs and in general get back to work. That process is known
as a host reset.
Blue systems reset completely in 2D6 minutes, during
which time the host deactivates security measures and the secu-
rity tally drops to 0. More secure hosts do not reser as quickly.
Green, Orange, and Red hosts reset after 3D6 minutes, provided
the decker did not trigger a passive or active alert in the system.
If a decker triggers an alert on a Green, Orange, or Red host.
the system resets even more slowly. Roll 1D6 every 5 minutes
for Green hosts, every 10 minutes for Orange hosts, and every
15 minutes for Red hosts; Reduce the system's security tally by
the result. Any IC program left running when the decker logged
off remains running until the security tally drops below the trig
ger step that activated the IC.
If any decker logs on to the host illegally before it finishes Its
reset, his security tally begins at the level the security tally had
dropped to when the intrusion occurred.
Selena invaded an Orange host and raised its security tally to 18
before she logged off with a killer IC program and a construct both
lusting for her chitlins. The system then began a host reset.
Half an hour later, when Cybersushi logs onto the same host, the
system is still resetting. Its security tally stands at 6. During Selena's
run, the host went on passive-alert status at trigger step 5, so the sys-
tem remains on passive alert. The killer IC activated at 12 and the
construct at 16, so both of these programs have shut down.
WHAT HOSTS DO
Host computers do not exist just to provide playgrounds for
deckers. When designing a host for use in a game, think about
the function the host serves in the "real world"-what data
resides on it, what processes it controls, and the like. The host's
primary function in turn determines if and why a decker would
invade the host, and his likely goals when doing so.
PAYDATA
Virtually all host systems contain datafiles. The vast majority
of these files offer nothing of any relevance to shadowrunners.
but some contain information that may be quite valuable in the
marketplace or may answer crucial questions, This information is
called paydata. Paydata can be new technology from the big
brains in R&D, business plans worth money to inside traders or

BORGTING 95
competitors, Incriminating information ripe for blackmail-any-
thing with value on the black market that exists for secret data.
Gamemasters may determine for themselves the exact
nature of any paydata contained in hosts in their games and role-
play character's attempts to sell it on the black market.
Alternatively, gamemasters may use the following random
method for determining paydata and its value.
Deckers must use Locate Paydata operations (see System
Operations. p. 115) to locate paydata. Guidelines for retrieving
paydata appear below.
Paydata Points
The paydata random-generation method uses Paydata
Points to measure the value of paydata. Characters may fence all
Faydata Points for the same amount, whether they retrieve the
data from a single file on a high-security system or from hun-
dreds of Mp of trash files on less dangerous hosts.
A host's security code determines how many Paydata Points
Its files contain. Less secure systems contain fewer Paydata
Points, and more secure systems contain more points. The
Paydata Points Table shows the dice rolls used to determine the
amount of Paydata Points on a system.
As stated above, deckers must download files to retrieve
Paydata Points. The size of each file is determined by its data
density, which varies according to the system's security code.
The Paydata Points Table provides dice rolls for determining the
data density of files on a system.

Charlie, the gamemaster, consults the Paydata Points Table and
rolls 206-2 to determine how many Paydata Points the system con-
tains. He rolls a 5, so the system contains 3 Paydata Points.
Gus achieves 2 successes on his Locate Paydata operation, so he
locates 2 of the Paydata Points. He decides to download the worth-
while files. Charlie again consults the Paydata Points Table to deter-
mine the data densities of the files containing the paydata. For the
first Paydata Point, he rolls 206 for a 6. He multiplies that by 15 and
finds that Gus has to download a 90 Mp file to get the first Paydata
Point. For the second point, the gamemaster rolls again and scores
12. So for the second point, Gus has to haul down a 180 Mp file. The
decker decides the paydata is not worth the effort and logs off.
Paydata Defenses
Generally, host operators do not lelive paydata files lying
around unprotected. On Green, Orange, and Red systems, pay
data files may be linked to data bombs, scramble IC, or othe
defenses. The gamemaster may design such protections himseil
or roll 1D6 and consult the Paydata File Defenses Table to deter-
mine the defenses attached to paydata files on a system.

fencing Paydata
The base street price of a Paydata Point is 5.000 nuyen.
However, the final price generally varies, as stolen paydata must
be fenced like any other stolen property (see p. 188, SRII, for
rules on fencing loot).
Deckers must move fast when selling stolen paydata. The
black market changes very quickly indeed, and today's hot info
is old news tomorrow, To reflect this condition, reduce the deck-
er's stock of Paydata Points by | for each day it remains unsold.
(This reduction does not apply to specific files invented by the
gamemaster as part of the adventure. Mr. Johnson's prices are
usually set in advance, and the time-sensitivity of such files
depends on the story.)
The nature of Data
For randomly determined datahauls and gamemaster-
designed datahauls, design paydata that fits with the nature of
the system being raided. When dealing with megacorporate sys-
tems. the gamemaster may find the corporate profiles in the
Corporate Shadowfiles sourcebook helpful, For example, that
book describes the Fuchi megacorp's major areas of interest as
computer engineering, computer science, Matrix security, and
fiscal operations. Logically, paydata retrieved from a Fuchi sys-
tem will likely be related to one or more of these areas.
From these bare bones, the gamemaster may improvise, For
example, a decker who snatched valuable paydata files from a.
Fuchi system may possess information that shows Fuchi has been
surveying the costs of developing Matrix security software.
Fuchi's competitors, such as Renraku, would probably be very
interested in such information.
The Corporate Shadowfiles entry on Renraku describes the
firm's high level of interest in both Matrix security and fiscal
operations -- so the idea fits quite well in the SR universe. In this
manner, the Corporate Shadowfiles profiles also can help the
gamemaster identify likely buyers for specific paydata.
Other SR sourcebooks provide background information for
other corporations. For example, the SES corporation (Tir na nÓg)
might possess parabiological datafiles. Cord Mutual (Neo-
Anarchist's Guide to North America) would store data relevant to
insurance, and the proprietors of Stuffer Shack™M would keep huge
wedges of data on toxic and addictive food additives and the like.
Obviously, some systems, especially public-access systems,
may not contain data of value to anyone. Keep in mind, howev-
er, thar appearances may be deceiving. For example, the archival
files of the Royal Armories of the Tower of London contain loads
of cross-indexed entries on the development of German plate
mail armor in the sixteenth century and similar subjects, Such
data is hardly likely to earn the decker any funds. However, the
Tower of London has a gory and intriguing history as well-the
bodies of more than 1.500 executed persons, mostly nobles, lie
buried beneath the stones of its small chapel. Who can say what
politically devastating files might be found within the hosts of the
Tower network?
Excessive Paydata Rewards
The random method for assigning Paydata Points allows
deckers to make money when they need it. Unfortunately, some
player character will inevitably discover that he can spend days
on end doing nothing but cracking Green systems and hauling
out enough paydata to become a millionaire by Friday. The
gamemaster has numerous options for preventing this.
First, corporations and governments pay particular attention
to repeat offenders. They expect and even allow a certain
amount of datatheft from their systems, but if things get out of
hand they send out investigative agents and nail the source of
the problem with unmatched efficiency. Corps even cooperate to
identify habitual criminals who spread out their thefts across
numerous companies.
The increased corporate/government heat fueled by such
deckers will most likely rakk off other deckers as well. They'll
quickly notice that someone is spoiling the biz for everyone.
They'll find out the name of the culprit from fixers and fencers
and they'll respond.
Finally, deckers who accumulate large amounts of nuyen
quickly attract the attention of other people, many of whom will
immediately begin devising ways to relleve such a decker of his
loot. When the decker realizes that his over-enthusiastic thieving
is being matched by a similar rise in the number of burglaries and
muggings he suffers, not to mention thefts from his own bank
balances, he may see the advantage of limiting his efforts.
The gamemaster may also counter excessive greed by
enforcing optional rules (especially those on Multiple
Improvements and SOTA) to greatly Increase the decker's need
for money.

SLAVE SYSTEMS
A host's slave subsystem handles any remote devices con-
trolled by the host. Slave subsystems control a wide range of
remote devices and systems, including automated vending
machines, site-security controls, hospital medical systems, auto-
mated factories and laboratories, air- and ground-traffic control
systems, power grids, telecommunications, and so on.
Gamemasters should determine whether a slave subsystem
needs to be operated from a central host, and whether that host
needs to be connected to the public grid. The UCAS Air Traffic
Control net. for example, consists of a series of Orange and Red
processors running in a Host-Host configuration over a govern-
ment PLTG, with no direct connection to the public nets.
An automated factory, on the other hand, needs to order
components and materials, update Inventory databases, process
orders, dispatch transport, and otherwise operate as part of a
business. As a result, the hosts involved in running a plant must
be accessible from the public grid in some way.
Very sensitive controls will almost certainly be on dedicated
processors, with Orange or Red security levels, buffered from inva-
sion behind chokepoints, tricky SAN designs, and layers of IC.
Security Remotes
Typically, corporations and other organizations use slave sub-
systems to operate the physical security infrastructure at a site,
During a shadowrun, while samurai and magical assets go in on
the ground, one or more deckers invade the host that controls the
site's cameras, security doors and maglocks, alarms, and so on.
The decker uses the Locate Slave operation to find the controls for
a given security device and then employs the Control Slave or Edit
Slave operations to take it over or suppress its alarms.
Another common decker trick is to use the Monitor Slave
operation to eavesdrop on secret meetings over the very sys-
tems Intended to protect such meetings.
Factories and Labs
To manipulate an automated factory, laboratory, or any sim-
Ilar process, a decker must possess a skill in how the process
works or an expert system that provides that skill for him. For
example, say a decker is altering the way an assembly line makes
cars. This may be a subtle sabotage job, where the manufacturer
is being set up to produce lemons, or a complicated piece of
equipment stealing (after making a high-performance set of
wheels, the decker is going to have it delivered to a neutral fixer
and fudge the accounting records to make the vehicle look paid
for). The decker needs to use Ground Vehicle B/R skill, or
Automotive Engineering, to give the right commands to the
slave subsystem. See the Control Slave operation for details
(System Operations. p. 1.1.1).
APPLICATIONS
Applications are legitimate host programs that lack Matrix
"intelligence" or direct user control. Application programs
include spreadsheets, document processors, analytical pro-
grams, database search programs, and dumb-terminal sessions.
Sabotaging an application, as opposed to simply crashing it,
Is a subtle mission. First, the decker must duplicate the program.
Then he must alter the program so that it does whatever he has
in mind: launch a frame at the appropriate moment, report find-
ings, fake output data to give bad conclusions or crocked results.
and so on.
Assume that standard business applications have a design
size of ID6 x 50 Mp, and scientific or industrial applications have
design sizes of 2D6 x 50 Mp. Double the size of applications that
handle very complex processes or operations (stock market
analysis, complex factory procedures, advanced scientific
research, and so on).
To duplicate and alter such programs, a character must use a
mainframe computer and possess a relevant skill. The character
combines the relevant skill with his Computer Skill and uses the
average of the two skills to make a test to perform the task. For
example, a decker would make a Computer/Physics Test, using
the average of his Computer and Physics skills. to rewrite a pro-
gram to support or sabotage a physics research project. A team
can use the highest skills of any of its members for such tasks.
Skillsofts or other expert systems may be employed as well.
Deckers must use an Edit File operation to upload the new
application program to the target host and place it into the file
containing the original application program.
UMS AND SCULPTED SYSTEMS
In the Matrix, what you do determines where you are. A
decker who succeeds in a Logon to Host operation on a grid
moves into the host's SAN. Logging on from a workstation
would put him in what Matrix 1.0 called an I/O port. If a decker
makes an Index Test to locate something, he is in the addressing
tables for the computer-an SPU or even the CPU under
Universal Matrix symbolism (UMS). A Files Test would move the
decker to a datastore or I/O port, a Slave Test to the slave node
that controls the device in question, and so on.
On systems that use UMS icons, the gamemaster can
describe the results of a decker's tests in terms of movement to
the various nodes, even though detailed mapping is no longer
required. A user in the Matrix can, In effect, reach any node from
any other node by performing the appropriate operation.
Location and description become matters of game color and
atmosphere, not necessity.
The same concept applies to sculpted systems, However, unlike
UMS systems, sculpted hosts possess a central metaphor, and all or
most of the things the decker experiences conform to that metaphor.
CHOOSING A METAPHOR
Sculpted systems use custom-designed imagery rather than
UMS icons. The megacorps started the trend and still maintain the
highest levels of virtual reality and detailed design. However, more
and more non-corporate systems, even the grids in places like Th
na nOg, are acquiring at least some level of distinctive sculpture,

The central metaphor of a sculpted system defines the virtu-
al reality of the system. When designing a simple sculpted sys-
tem, choose a concrete name for its principal image: Office
Complex, Castle, Amusement Park, Egyptian Palace, and so on.
Complex systems? All limits are off. The Denver Datahaven is a
flashing model of a fantastic solar system orbiting a massive
black hole, The Mitsuhama Pagoda contains virtual villages
where application icons toil patiently in the rice paddies of a
cybernetic medieval Japanese milieu, and sensitive data is stored
In fortresses that make Osaka Castle look like a kiddy toy.
Simple or complicated, the gamemaster should pick a
metaphor he can have fun with. Don't worry about accuracy in
historical or literary settings. Designers in the film and sim indus-
tries have been putting zippers on medieval gowns for at least a
century, Ninety-nine percent of Matrix sculptors go for what
looks chill, not what matches the history books. Natch, if the
gamemaster is personally wiz at. say, Victorian London, then the
most realistic sculpted system in an adventure might happen to
recreate the milieu of Sherlock Holmes and Jack the Ripper. In
any case, the metaphor should capture the gamers' Imagina-
tions, and suggest images that fit the commonest System Tests
and system operations,
Hosts in a linked network, certainly sharing host-host access,
usually share the same metaphor. Keep in mind that these
metaphors are usually intended to make day-to-day work easier
and more intuitive for the people who use these computers,
EFFECTS OF SCULPTED SYSTEMS AND REALITY FILTERS
When a decker logs on to a sculpted system. everything he
does or senses is explained in terms of the system's central
metaphor. He has to act as if the metaphor were his reality. If his
icon is in a virtual corridor, for example, he cannot walk through
the walls. If a decker insists on describing his actions in terms
that do not conform to the system's central metaphor, apply a +2
modifier to all target numbers for tests he makes in the system.
System sculpture can slow down deckers whose MPCP
Imageries, or reality filters, do not conform to the system's central
metaphor. The gamemaster determines whether this happens.
If the decker's icon doesn't fit the metaphor on the sculpted
system, the decker rolls an MPCP Test against the system's
Security Value. If the test fails, he loses 2 points from his Reaction
and ID6 of Initiative as long as he remains within the sculpted
environment. (System sculpture can extend over linked hosts in
a network, even over an entire PLTG and its attached hosts, so
the decker may suffer the penalties for quite awhile.)
If the test succeeds, his filter dictates the system architecture dur-
Ing the run, and his Initiative bonus for using the filter remains intact.
MAPPING SCULPTED SYSTEMS
In Matrix 2.0, formal system maps, like the UMS diagrams
used under Matrix 1.0, are unnecessary. Gamemasters need only
note, either on paper or mentally, the appearances of the main
subsystems.
For example, ScreamDream Productions, a simsense studio
that grinds out wildly popular horror adventures, has sculpted Its
000
WELCOME
SCREAM DREAM
LPRODUCTIONS
headquarters host with a Haunted House central metaphor. The
system is full of characters and settings from ScreamDream sims,
Logging on, one walks through a mist-covered front yard, as
vague voices mutter at the edge of comprehensibility all around
you. When you knock on the massive, Victorian front door, the
lumbering butler from Blood of the Goblins opens it and
demands the passcode.
The great central hall is modeled after the site of the final
massacre in Revenge of the Living Corpses, From the hall, stair-
ways and passages wind off in many different directions.
Searching for a file leads to the extensive library upstairs, where
poisonous spiders guard sensitive file pointers, and a secret door
leads into an old dungeon (from the horror-comedy Catacomb
Crawlers) where deadfall traps, animated skeletons, and sham-
bling horrors await the decker who carelessly rifles through the
executive datastores down there.
The studio complex's security cameras feed images through
the hundreds of mirrors in the Hall of Madness from Reflections,
and the slave subsystem that coordinates the simsynths used in
post-production is accessed through a Rube Goldberg pipe
organ from Phantom of the Opera Meets Godzilla.
That's the way to "map" a sculpted system-not with lines
and boxes, but with scribbled notes or just a vivid and slightly
askew imagination and a fun metaphor.

We can define the numbers that define the decker. In this section, we do just that. But only
the players can provide the attitude that turns a technonerd with a megayen worth of com-
puting gear into à decker.

ATTRIBUTES
The Mental Attributes rule, as far as most deckers are con-
cerned. After all, Intelligence is crucial to the Hacking Pool.
While Body may be Important when resisting damage from black
IC, the new biofeedback ICCM technology (see Cyberdecks, p.
86) lets deckers disregard Body and depend on their Willpower.
Enough Quickness for a decent Reaction value is useful. but
frankly, most hot deckers depend on their decks, not their meat.
for speed. The only Mental Attribute not essential to decking is
Charisma. Some deckers say this reflects and continues a time-
honored tradition (and stereotype) of brilliant nerds with no time
for social trivia like empathy, relationships, self-awareness and
that kind of drek.
SKILLS
The Computer Skill Is ESSENTIAL for deckers. Its Software
Concentration includes the Decking Specialization, but beginning
deckers will suffer if they increase skill in Decking at the expense
of programming ability.
The maximum rating of the programs that characters can
design equals the rating of their Computer (or Software, or
Matrix Programming) Skill. The ratings of character-designed
MPCP and frame cores may not exceed the character's Computer
(or Software, or Matrix Programming) Skill multiplied by 1,5.
The Hardware Concentration Is not as important as the afore-
mentioned concentrations. Computer B/R is the skill for building
decks, The Hardware Skill comes into play if the decker is design-
ing basic components, rather than bashing stock parts into his deck.
The Etiquette (Matrix) Skill governs searches for equipment,
software sources, local access to Shadowlands, and other goods
and services. This skill also keeps the decker current on who the
major players are in cyberspace and lets him pick up the latest
rumors in the global gossip of the Matrix, Gamemasters should
not overlook this skill. Use it to determine whether a decker gets
hot goss on who's got goodies that might be useful to him (great
new software, contacts, paydata Info) and more besides.
THE PERSONA
The persona, the decker's online Icon, is defined by the MPCP
and BEMS ratings of the deck (see Deck Ratings, p. 16, In Matrix
2.0), and by the deck's special options, such as Response Increase.
The final measure of the persona's processing power is the utility
programs loaded Into the deck during a run.
The following two sections, Cyberdecks and Programs, pro-
vide rules for designing and constructing the hardware and soft-
ware that make up the cyberdeck, and the persona it generates.
This section discusses the basics of what the programs do, and the
decisions the decker must make when he is loading his deck.
THE MPCP
The master persona control program (MPCP) is the operat-
Ing system of the cyberdeck, It runs on a dedicated processing
chip and is the central component of the cyberdeck. The MPCP is
the heart of the circuitry that supports the other persona pro-
grams, like the motherboard in a regular microcomputer.
In addition to performing its technical functions, the MPCP
defines the persona's appearance. On a legitimate terminal, it car-
ries the so-called Matrix signature. Every time a user logs on to a
system, edits a file, touches a control system, a logging function in
the MPCP writes a record of the user's signature, timestamp, and
a code indicating what the user did into the system.
Cyberdecks, almost by definition, do not possess Matrix sig
natures. Deckers illegally "stealth" their MPCPs and fit them with
illegal masking chips. But each MPCP is subtly different from
every other, and these differences give each MPCP a distinctive
appearance in Matrix Iconography. Some deckers are paranoid
enough to continuously tinker with their icon, radically changing
its appearance on a regular basis. Others accept the inevitable
and maintain the same look rather than endanger their precious
"edge" by undermining their sense of identity in the nets.
Characters rarely use the MPCP in tests. The two principal
exceptions are rests measuring the stability of the icon program
on a sculpted host (see Effects of Sculpted Systems and
Reality Filters, p. 69, in Mapping Matrices) and when the deck
itself is under attack by gray or black IC (see Intrusion Counter-
measures, p. 38).
All the other programs on the deck, both persona programs
and utilities, execute under the MPCP's control. Therefore, the
MPCP Rating determines the maximum ratings for these subor-
dinate programs. The total ratings of the four Persona programs
cannot exceed the MPCP Rating x 3. No utility can have a rating
greater than the deck's MPCP. (See Deck Ratings, p. 16 in
Matrix 2.0. for more Information.)
PERSONA PROGRAMS
The latest piece of Matrix slang for persona attributes is
"BEMS." for Bod, Evasion. Masking, and Sensor, These four qual-
ities measure the effectiveness of the persona in cyberspace.
Bod
Bod measures the stability of the character's icon- its resis-
tance to error, logic attacks, and other cybernetic attacks. A high
Bod Rating is important for deckers who like to solve problems
via cybercombat.
Evasion
Evasion measures the agility of the Icon-its ability to
maneuver in cybercombat and escape the attentions of trace IC.
Evasion is not generally installed on most cyberterminals, unless
they are designed specifically for cybercombat. Not the kind of
feature you find on an office worker's desktop.
Masking
Masking measures the ability of an illegal icon to avoid
detection. This attribute is especially important when resisting
the system Security Tests that oppose the decker every time he
makes a System Test. Typically. Masking programs are not

Installed on legal cyberterminals. Investing in excellent Masking
Is arguably the sign of a decker who knows what he's doing.
Sensor
The Sensor attribute controls the icon's perception of cyberspace
and measures its ability to process data. The attribute may be used
for ad hoc Sensor (System Security Value) Tests to notice changes in
the host computer, such as alert states, IC activations, and so on.
OPTIONAL RULE: DECK MODES
Under the optional Deck Modes rule, cyberdecks are in one
of five modes at all times- default mode, bod mode, evasion
mode, masking mode, and sensor mode. Each mode has distinct
effects and confers specific bonuses and limitations. Switching
between modes requires a Complex Action, and decks may be
In only one mode at a time
When Increasing or decreasing values under the deck
modes rule, round up all fractions.
Generally, substantial disadvantages counterbalance the
advantages gained by using any deck mode. Throughput loss
makes this especially true for the evasion mode. For this reason,
deckers may wish to reserve deck-mode switches for special cir-
cumstances. For example, a decker might choose to switch to
evasion mode when he identifies the presence of trace IC in a
system gone to passive alert.
DEFAULT MODE
In the default mode, all deck ratings remain at their base values.
BOO MODE
In bod mode, the deck's MPCP allocates resources to resist
damage. The Bod attribute increases 50 percent. The Evasion,
Masking, and Sensor attributes are reduced by 50 percent each.
The deck's I/O bandwidth is reduced by 50 percent as well.
That is, If the decker has 100 Mp of total bandwidth allocated, he
only gets 50 Mp of throughput (throughput is the actual speed of
data over commline). See Cyberdecks, p. 90, for bandwidth rules.
EVASION MODE
Typically, deckers use evasion mode to avoid trace IC and
enhance the combat maneuvers of a deck. Evasion mode
Increases a deck's Evasion attribute by 50 percent. Bod,
Masking, and Sensor are reduced by 50 percent. as is the deck's
bandwidth throughput.
MASHING MODE
Masking mode increases the deck's Masking attribute by 50
percent. The deck's Bod, Evasion, and Sensor attributes are
reduced by 50 percent. Bandwidth throughput is unaffected.
SENSOR MODE
Sensor mode improves the persona's ability to detect
changes in the host environment, as well as the ability to counter
combat maneuvers. Sensor is increased by 50 percent. Bod.
Evasion, and Masking attributes are reduced by 50 percent.
Bandwidth throughput is unaffected,
DECKERS AND TASKS
Tasks follow the same pattern whether they involve hardware
or software, (See Cyberdecks, p. 81, and Programs, p. 94, for
details on designing and constructing hardware and software.)
All tasks require a base time, usually measured in days.
Most important, every task requires a Success Test (specified in
the description of the task) to develop the basic design of the
program, circuit, or whatever. The base time divided by the num-
ber of successes from the test equals the number of days in the
task period. The task period is the actual amount of time it takes
the decker to finish the task.
If the Success Test fails, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and
divides the base time by the result. Round fractions up in this
instance. The result equals the number of days of work that the
character must put in on the task before discovering that the
design is irretrievably flawed and that he must begin again. Task
bonuses, defined below, apply to this work,
The gamemaster should make these Success Tests secretly,
so that only he knows the actual task period and the success or
failure of the attempt. Alternatively, the gamemaster may have
the players make a number of Success Tests In advance and use
the results when the player attempts tasks.
TASH BONUSES
Each task requires minimum tools and resources. Without
these required tools, the job cannot be done at all. With them.
one day of work, defined as 10 hours of uninterrupted labor at
the job, reduces the task period by one day. Gamemasters
should resist the blandishments of players who claim their deck-
ers can put in a 15-hour day thanks to excessive intake of caf-
feine and the latest meditational exercises.
In some cases, superior resources may grant a bonus to the
work rate, A +1 task bonus means that one day's work reduces
the task period by 2 days. A + 2 task bonus reduces the task peri-
od by 3 days for a day of work, and so on. Rules for specific tasks.
presented In subsequent sections, nore which tasks may be
shortened with task bonuses.
FINISHING TASHS
Characters may complete tasks in parts, rather than in single
unbroken efforts. For example, a character attempting a task with
a 20-day task period may perform 5 days of work, go off on an
adventure, do another 10 days of work, work on another task,
and then do 5 more days of work to complete the task.
HEALTH AND TASKS
Characters suffering from Light wounds may work at tasks
unimpeded. Characters suffering from Moderate wounds may
perform tasks, but they have only half their normal productivity,

A character with a Moderate wound would have to work 2 days
to accomplish the I standard day of work on a task
Characters with Serious wounds cannot work on tasks at all
As for dead characters-well. we appreciate their spirit, but they
should really take the day off.
OPTIONAL RULE: SOTA
Tech doesn't Stand still. The deck that cracked a mainframe
wide open last month might not even get past the SAN today.
To stay on the edge. A decker has to stay current with the "suite
of the art." the SOTA

The key to the decker's art, the cyberdeck Is an extremely powerful microcomputer
with a
hly specialize
d Instruction set. Its processing power is dedicated to Implementing
the ASIST Interface that converts the decker's neural impulses into the programming Instruc-
tions that bend the Matrix to his will.

This section provides rules for constructing and buying
cyberdecks. In Matrix 2.0, deck buyers are not restricted to the
"off-the-peg" decks of the original SR rules. Now, buyers may
purchase modular units that allow a decker to select the compo-
nents and capabilities of the deck. Of course, such decks cost big
nuyen, and where's the pride in it?
The section is divided into three main parts: Constructing
Decks, Tools and Parts, and various subsections on the compo-
nents of a deck. Constructing Decks provides a general expla-
nation of deck construction. Tools and Parts provides informa-
tion on the tools and parts needed to build decks. The compo-
nent subsections provide information on each component and
rules for Installing or assembling the component.
CONSTRUCTING DECKS
All cyberdecks contain certain components, such as an
MPCP, persona programs, an ASIST Interface, active memory.
and storage memory. Without these components, a deck simply
will not work. The components are assembled in a series of tasks
that may be performed by the decker himself of a cyberdeck
technician.
I/O speed is so vital that it is almost mandatory, but theo-
retically a decker can make a run without it if no significant data
transfers are Involved. All other components, no matter how
useful they may be. are optional.
TASH DESCRIPTIONS
All of the component entries in this section contain task
descriptions. These descriptions provide the ratings, tests, and
other game values involved in producing or upgrading that par-
ticular component. Tasks are divided Into three types: Software
Tasks, Cook Tasks, and Installation Tasks.
Software Task
If a component requires a program, the program's effective rat-
Ing and size multiplier are listed in the Software Task heading, These
values are used in the programming task (see Programs. p. 100).
To construct a cyberdeck, a decker must obtain a custom-
programmed or off-the-shelf object copy of the software before
he can do any work on the component's hardware.
Cook Task
Software such as MPCPs, persona programs, and support
code for programs such as Response Increase are all permanent-
ly written onto "firmware" chips, also known as optical-code
chips (OCCs). All other components that require software use
OCCs as well.
Characters may purchase pre programmed OCCs from an
outside source-one they literally trust with their lives-or they
may encode software onto OCCs themselves by performing
Cook Tasks
All Cook Tasks require the use of an optical-chip encoder.
Encoders are described in Tools and Parts, Cook Tasks have base
times and cook times as well, which are described in each com-
ponent's Cook Task description. Additionally, every Cook Task
requires a Computer B/R Test. The target number for the test is
supplied in the component's Cook Task description.
OCCs and components that use OCCs may not be installed
until the chips have been created with a Cook Task.
Installation Task
Once a decker has cooked or purchased any required OCCs
for a component, he may buy any necessary parts and install the
component. Each component's Installation Task description pro-
vides the base time and Success Test needed to complete the
component's installation,
The prices of circuitry and other parts required for installa-
tion are described in Tools and Parts
CRANIAL CYBERDECHS
Characters must use cranial deck parts, not standard ones,
when constructing cranial decks, or CZ decks. The Implant spe-
cialization of Computer Skill Is the appropriate skill for all Cook
and Installation tasks made when constructing CZ decks, Apply a
+2 modifier to all target numbers if using Computer B/R Skill for
these tests instead.
C2 decks also require the use of cybernetic as well as micro-
tronic tools, For example, If the task description for a component
calls for a Microtronics Shop. the task would require a
Cybernetics Shop as well If the decker is constructing a C2 deck
See pp. 54-59, SRII, for more Information on cranial
cyberdecks.
TOOLS AND PARTS
Once a character purchases tools, he may use them for var-
lous tasks. For example, a decker may use an optical-chip
encoder to cook any number of OCCs-he does not need to pur-
chase a new one to make new chips.
However, parts are consumed when the task is performed,
Once the job is done, the parts have been turned into a piece of
the cyberdeck. Characters must purchase additional parts to per-
form additional tasks
TOOLS
Microtronics tools are required for all cyberdeck construc
tion, both external and cybernetic. These tools come in kits,
shops and facilities. A kit is a portable supply of tools for per-
forming basic work. A shop contains more tools and can be
moved only with a large van or small truck. A facility contains
bulky, heavy machinery and is immobile.
Tasks that require a small tool unit, such as a kit, may be per-
formed with any larger unit, such as a shop or facility. In fact.
using a larger tool unit than required confers a Task Bonus, as
illustrated on the Tool Unit Table. Kits may not be used for tasks
that require shops and facilities; shops are not adequate for tasks
that require facilities.

Many tasks require a personal computer with a minimum
memory size. This same computer can, of course, be used to
write the programs for the software elements of a component.
The price for a desktop unit is provided in the Tool Prices Table.
(See p. 259, SRII, for prices of more compact computers.)
Optical-chip encoders use a quantum process to program
OCCs. The process breaks down and reconstructs the crystalline
lattice of the "raw" chip. The encoder's rating is added to the
Computer B/R Skill a character uses for a Cook Task. The better
encoders also provide a Task Bonus, Encoders weigh a few kilo-
grams and are about the size of a shoebox.
Once cooked, OCCs cannot be reprogrammed. Upgrading
and repairing OCCs requires a whole new Cook Task.

PARTS
Each component's task description specifies any parts need-
ed for each component. Part prices appear in the Part Prices
Table. Task descriptions provide any task-related cost multipliers
as well. For example. Hardening a deck requires redundant data-
transport circuits, and so the DTC cost is multiplied by the
Hardening Rating, squared.
Chips are rated in price per megapulse. The component task
descriptions describe required chip ratings as the type of chip, at
the size of the relevant program. For example, an OCC would be
shown as "OCC @ program size," at 20 nuyen per Mp of pro-
gram size.
Circuitry is measured in Rating Points and priced per point.
For example, an entry in a task description such as "PLC @ MPCP
Rating" would mean buying processor-logic circuitry with the
same rating as the MPCP. at 25 nuyen per point.
The component task descriptions list any required special-
ized parts and their prices as well. Cranial components are
required for C2 decks.
All parts are readily available. Even cranial components are eas-
ily available through cyberware markets. Non-cranial components
are always available and have Street Indexes of 1. Cranial compo-
nents have Availabilities of 4/72 hours and Street Indexes of 1.5.

UPGRADES
Upgrades represent improvements to existing components.
The Software Tasks for upgrades are based on the difference
between the component's old rating and its upgraded rating.
Calculate the size of the upgraded program and subtract the size
of the old program to determine the amount of work involved in
the task. Program upgrades are discussed in more detail in
Programs, p. 107.
Characters must perform the Cook and Installation tasks for the
component from scratch, using the new software rating and size.
For example, a decker has an MPCP-6 deck with Hardening-
4. The Hardening software is 144 Mp in size. If the decker
upgrades the Hardening to 5, the new size is 180 Mp-a 36 Mp
upgrade. After performing programming equivalent to a 36 Mp
program, the decker performs the Cook and Installation tasks,
These are based solely on MPCP-6 and Hardening-5, as if the
component were being built from scratch.

OPTIONAL RULE: SALVAGE
Gamemasters may allow deckers to "salvage" 50 percent of
the value of parts they replace In upgrades. This represents
Income from selling outdated OCCs, old memory chips, reusing
circuit logies, and so on.
MPCP
As noted in previous sections, no persona program on a
deck may have a rating higher than the deck's MPCP rating.
Additionally, the combined ratings of a deck's persona programs
may not exceed the MPCP Rating multiplied by 3.
In addition, no utility may have a rating higher than the
MPCP Rating. However, the MPCP Rating does not limit the num-
ber of utilities the deck may run at any single time. That limit is
purely a function of the deck's active memory size and the size
of the utilities (see below).
MPCP UPGRADES
Improvements In the holographic code links under Matrix
2.0 have eliminated the older, more rigorous requirements that
controlled MPCP upgrades: Characters no longer need to
upgrade persona programs to match new MPCP Ratings.
However, whenever a character upgrades his deck's MPCP.
he also must upgrade components that have construction tasks
that Involve the MPCP. These components Include the ASIST
Interface, the ICCM filter, and Response Increase. Until the deck-
er upgrades these components to match the new MPCP Rating.
he cannot run his deck with both the new MPCP and the old
components. He may run the deck with the older, lower MPCP
Rating and continue to use the components, or he may run with
his new, higher MPCP rating but without the components.
REALITY FILTERS
Reality filters Impose a metaphor on the Matrix chosen by
the decker and programmed into his deck's MPCP. A decker who
likes baseball can model an entire Matrix run on a hard-fought
game. A decker with a taste for swashbuckling can swagger his
way through the world of a cybernetic musketeer or duelist.
In practical terms. a reality filter acts as an additional level of
Response Increase on the cyberdeck. It Increases Reaction by 2
and adds + ID6 to Initiative, However, a reality filter also Increas-
es the MPCP's design rating by 2. This increase affects design
size and all base times, target numbers, and so on, based on the
MPCP's Rating, though the real size of the program is not
increased. Reality filters also reduce MPCP Ratings by 1. As a
result, deckers may have to reduce their persona programs to
keep them within acceptable limits (see MPCP).
The decker may operate his deck without turning on the
reality filter. In that case, he does not receive the Response
Increase or the rating reduction.
Turning a reality filter on and off is a Free Action. However,
until the beginning of the next Combat Turn after toggling the fil-
ter on or off, reduce the decker's current Initiative by half and
apply a +2 modifier to all his target numbers.
MPCP ICONOGRAPHY
Instead of jamming the entire Matrix through reality filters,
deckers also may adapt their icon's appearance, or iconography, to
fit the metaphors they are likely to encounter on a sculpted system.
An MPCP program can be cooked with alterations to the
Iconography If the decker has the source code, The program-
ming changes only take a few hours to write and do not require
a test, but the Cook Task requires the standard task period and
components.
The decker can then simply pop the new chip Into the
deck's motherboard-no Installation Task is required.
Deckers may maintain a library of MPCP chips, each
designed to present an image that blends with a specific system
iconography, and thus avoid the penalties for violating the
metaphor of a sculpted system.

ACTIVE MEMORY
Active memory is the cyberdeck's "RAM," to use the old-
tech term. Just as hackers in the twentieth century talked about
having 64 meg of memory on their computers, a Sixth World
decker refers to 100 Mp of active memory on his deck.
A deck's active memory limits the utility programs the deck
can run and have ready for use by the persona at any one time.
A deck with 100 Mp of active memory can run no more than 100
Mp of utilities at any one time.
(These limits are in addition to any limits imposed under the
optional Icon bandwidth rule.)

ASIST INTERFACE
The ASIST interface component controls the simsense expe-
rience of cyberspace and the decker's DNI (direct neural inter-
face) connection to the Matrix, as routed through the interpreta.
tive software coded into the MPCP. The interface also has a con
trol program of its own to handle the data exchange.
This ain't no home sim entertainment unit. The typical signal
strength on a full-bore cyberdeck is not too far below the brain-
kicking current a wirehead gets from a BTL chip. That gives the
decker the best interface to the Matrix, and when a deck is run-
ning ar that intensity, it is sometimes called a "hot" deck.
However, a decker can deliberately reduce the intensity of
the ASIST signal, down to about the level of legal simsense. This
is called a "cool" deck. Cool decks can reduce the persona's
speed in cyberspace, but black IC cannot inflict lethal damage
over a cool Interface, Lethal black IC acts as non-lethal black IC
through a cool deck. Psychotropic black IC, however, works over
both levels of interface.
A decker can install hot or cool ASIST circuitry, If he installs
the hot circuit, he can selectively switch from hot to cool, or vice-
versa, at will, However, switching Interface circuitry while under
attack by black IC requires the same tests as jacking out. A cool
interface can only run cool. Either ASIST Interface can be
switched off entirely, which turns the deck into a "tortoise" (see
Tortoises).
Whenever a decker upgrades his deck's MPCP, he must also
upgrade the ASIST interface, Until he does so, the deck acts like
a tortoise if he runs with the new. higher MPCP, but the interface
works as designed if operated with the MPCP at the old value.
CONTROL INTERFACES
A hot deck can be run without any manual control surfaces.
All commands are transmitted via DNI This enables a decker to
cool down the deck during a run, but acts as another level of
Response Increase, adding 2 to Reaction and + ID6 to Initiative.
A deck equipped with a keyboard and a hot ASIST Interface
can be run hot, cool, or even tortoise-cold.
Running a deck cool, by using a keyboard and other manu-
al controls to augment the ASIST interface, reduces a decker's
Initiative by 1D6.
RAS OVERRIDE
ASIST circuitry Includes a reticular-activation system over-
ride (RAS). The RAS override suppresses sensory signals from the
decker's meat body, freeing him to concentrate fully on the sim-
sense experience of the Matrix. The RAS override also louses up
any physical coordination the decker has, so apply a +8 modifi-
er to target numbers for any Physical Tests à decker must make
while jacked in. In addition, concentrating on the physical world
louses up a decker's Initiative badly (see Cybercombat, p. 120).
Disconnecting the RAS override dilutes the ASIST interface
so badly that the cyberdeck acts like a "tortoise.".
TORTOISES
Tortoises are cyberdecks without ASIST Interfaces. They use
VR goggles, holo-display screens or even flatscreens, gloves,
trackballs, and other low-end tools to simulate the Matrix expe-
rience without a DNI connection. A deck without an RAS over-
ride is equally inferior. Characters can build tortoises easily and
cheaply, because cost of the VR equipment is a trivial component
of the MPCP price,
Deckers can always switch off their decks' ASIST Interface
circuitries and turn their decks into tortoises. If under attack by
black IC, this counts as "Jacking out" and requires the same tests
to succeed (see Black IC in Combat, p. 47, in Intrusion
Countermeasures).
Tortoises reduce the user's Reaction by half. rounding down,
to a minimum value of 1. They can be equipped with Response
Increase, but users only receive the additional 1D6 for Initiative.

ICCM BIOFEEDBACK FILTER
Intrusion counter-countermeasures (ICCM) technology protects
deckers from the worst effects of black IC. New generation ICCM
technology allows ICCM devices to be built directly into cyberdecks,
An ICCM filter increases the decker's chances of jacking out
successfully when under attack by black IC. Apply a -2 modifier
to the target number for the Willpower (IC Rating) Test (see Black
IC In Combat. p. 47. in Intrusion Countermeasures).
The filter also allows a decker to make two separate Damage
Resistance Tests against lethal and non-lethal black IC-one test
with Body and one with Willpower. The player may choose the
test with the best result to use as the character's resistance.
Karma Pool dice added to the test are rolled separately and aug-
ment the chosen Resistance Test. Hacking Pool dice cannot be
used for these tests.
The ICCM filter is not effective against the psychological
effects of psychotropic IC. However, It does buffer the decker
from the physical side effects of sparky IC programs (see Gray IC,
p. 43 in Intrusion Countermeasures), the same as it does
against black IC.
Constructing an ICCM filter requires Computer B/R and
Biotech skills. The Success Tests for the Cook and Installation
Tasks use the average of these skills, though two characters may
Instead work as a team to perform the tasks, each contributing
one of the two skills.

1/0 SPEED
The input and output of a deck is analogous to the old
modems that connected terminals and computers back in the
dark ages of computing. The I/O speed indicates the maximum
1/O bandwidth that a decker can allocate to a task.
A standard cyberterminal, whether legal or a deck, auto-
matically and always can handle its icon bandwidth as a function
of its MPCP, so the I/O speed feature only comes into play when
using the optional bandwidth rule (see Bandwidth, p. 90), If the
optional bandwidth rule is not in effect, all uploads and down-
loads are always at the full I/O speed of a deck.

V/O speed must be built in multiples of 10. The maximum
bandwidth value of a deck is equal to the deck's Sensor Rating x
MPCP Rating x 10 Mp.

RESPONSE INCREASE
Response Increase is the Matrix equivalent of wired reflex-
es. Each point of Response Increase increases a persona's
Reaction attribute by 2 and Initiative by + ID6.
A deck can support only 3 points of Response Increase,
Furthermore, Response Increase cannot exceed a deck's MPCP
Rating divided by 4, rounding fractions down (so a deck with MPCP
Rating 3 or below cannot sustain any level of Response Increase).
In addition to the deck's 3 points of Response Increase, deck-
ers may gain an additional point of Response Increase by using a
reality filter. Furthermore, deckers running hot decks on pure DNI
control may gain an additional point of Response Increase. The
absolute maximum of Response Increase a deck may have is 5
points, which translates as + 10 to Reaction and 6D6 for Initiative!
Response Increase requires both programming and hardware
construction. The programming task is based on an effective rating
equal to the MPCP, with a multiplier equal to the Response
Increase Rating multiplied by 2. For example, on an MPCP-6 deck,
the software component of Response Increase-2 would require
programming a 62 x 4 routine, a design size of 144 Mp. (See
Programs, p. 100, for information on programming tasks.)
This design size also affects the cost of the task, because the
decker must use an OCC large enough to hold the Response program.

SATLINK INTERFACE
A satlink interface consists of a cyberdeck-mounted protocol-
conversion logic and a satellite dish. High-density fiber-optic cable
with built-in signal boosters connects the deck to the dish. The sig-
nal boosters enable a decker to run a signal through several kilo-
meters of this cable without using an external signal booster. Any
dish formar may be used with a deck fitted with an interface.
A standard satellite dish is one-half meter across and weighs
five kilograms. Large portable dishes are one meter across and
weigh eight kilograms: they reduce by 1 the target number for
tests to locate satellites (see Satellite Links, p. 30), Fixed-base
earth stations reduce target numbers by 2. Mobile fixed-base
earth stations require trucks and trailers.
Characters Inclined toward a do-it-yourself philosophy may
also fashion temporary satellite dishes out of spray polymer and
plastic webbing. These dishes can be assembled and mounted
almost anywhere, but they only last for a few hours. The elec-
tronics for a temporary dish weigh 3 kilograms and can be
reused, The electronic components pack down into a box about
50 centimeters by 25 centimeters by 25 centimeters.

STORAGE MEMORY
Storage memory is analogous to the hard drives on old-time
computers. Any program in a deck's storage memory can be
loaded onto the deck by using the Swap Memory operation. Any
utilities a decker plans to use during a run must be kept in stor-
age memory. Data for uploads and downloads can be kept in
Storage Memory, or the cheaper off-line storage.
The Matrix 1.0 load-speed rule, which controls the speed of
data transfers between storage memory and active memory.
does not apply in Matrix 2.0.

MISCELLANEOUS COMPONENTS
Certain fixed-price deck components, such as casing. hitch-
er jacks and vidscreens, act the same whether they are hooked
up to an icepicked CyberShak cheapy that some high-school
hacker is using to fix his grades or the finest product of the
Fairlight labs.
A deck's casing protects it from the daily bump and grind of
a shadowrunner's life. If a deck is exposed to physical damage,
It has an effective Bod of 1. The cost of casing is negligible when
compared to the cost of other deck components. If someone
wants to buy a bunch of empty casings, figure they're worth 10
nuyen apiece. Prices for other basic components appear in the
Component Prices Table.

DECKS À LA CARTE
In Matrix 2.0. deckers can order decks from manufacturers,
who assemble them using components specified by the decker.
The Deck Component Prices Table provides formulas for calculat-
Ing the prices of these components. Each formula represents the
entire cost of the component, including software, hardware, cir-
cultry, installation-the whole nine meters. Slot your stick and
the deckmeister puts this in your deck, ready to run.
The formulas are derived from the cost of the component's
software, chips, circuitry, and so on given in the task description.
Components with software feature a Program Factor (PF), the
multiplier in the price formula for software. The PF is determined
according to a specific rating of the deck, called the PF basis. For
example, the P'F basis for a deck's Hardening is the deck's MPCP
Rating. The Program Factors Table shows PFs for various ratings.
For example, a MPCP-8 deck has a PF of 500 nuyen for its
hardening program formula.

PACKAGE DISCOUNTS
Generally, deckers receive a 10-percent discount when
ordering a complete deck (MPCP, persona chips, and ASIST inter-
face, plus optional components and features).
After a particularly lucrative run, SuzyQ decides to treat herself to
a new cyberdeck. She orders an MPCP-8/6/6/6/6 deck with Response
Increase-2, 480 MePS of 1/0 speed, Hardening-4, as ICCM filter, 1,000
Mp of active memory, 1,500 Mp of storage memory, and a hot ASIST
interface.
The price breakdown for SuzyQ's new deck looks like this:
MPCP:
82 x [(8 x 500) + 195] = 54 x 4,195 = 258,480
Bod:
62 x [(3 × 200) + 95] = 36 x 695 = 25,020
Evasion:
62 x [(3 x 200) + 95] = 36 x 695 = 25,020
Masking:
62 x [(2 x 200) + 75] = 36 x 475 = 17,100

Sensor:
62 x |(2 x 200) + 75] = 36 x 475 = 17,100
Active Memory:
1,000 x 7.5 = 7,500
Storage Memory:
1,500 x 6 = 9,000
ASIST Interface:
(82 × |(500 x 2) + 40]) + (8 x 50) = (64 × 1,040) + 400 = 66,550 + 400 =
66,960
Response Increase:
((82 × 2) * (500 + 80)] + (2 x 105) = (128 x 580) + 210 = 74,450
V/O Speed:
480 × 30 = 14,400
Hardening:
(42 x [(500 × 8) + 160]) + (4 x 70) = (16 × 4,160) + 280 = 66,560 + 280
=66,840
ICCM Filter:
(82 x (500 x 4) +115]) + 5,000 = (64 x 2,115) + 5,000 = 135,360 +
5,000 = 140,360
Putting it all together, the deck's price comes to 732,230 nuyen. At
the basic 10-percent package discount, Suzy's bill comes to 659,007
nuyen. A more generous 20 percent package discount brings the price
down to 585,784 nuyen.

OPTIONAL RULE: BREADBOARDING
All the base numbers for deck construction assume that the
manufacturer or decker is building a standard portable
cyberdeck-a laptop, In twentieth-century terminology. But
cyberdecks can be breadboarded-built larger, faster, and cheap-
er with whacked out desktop-sized components and external
black boxes to handle special functions.
Breadboarded CPUs, which contain an MPCI, personaware,
Response, Hardening and I/O speed-weigh 10 kilograms. All
other breadboarded components weigh 2 kilograms more than
the standard component. A complete breadboarded deck is
about the size of a twentieth century desktop computer.
When using breadboard construction, reduce the target
numbers for the Cook and Installation tasks by 2 and reduce the
cost of parts by 50 percent. The same discount applies to à la
carte deck building. Breadboard components are not compatible
with standard decks.
On the other hand, breadboarded and standard decks run
the same software, and programs developed for a breadboarded
deck can be cooked into OCCs for a regular deck at any time-a
program is a program. By the same token, the same utilities run
on both standard and breadboarded decks.
CZ decks cannot be breadboarded. You can never find a hat
that fits
OPTIONAL RULE: COMMERCIAL CONVERSIONS
Under Matrix 1.0, deckers purchased legal cyberterminals at
street prices that reflected the initial steps of deck conversion:)
stealthing the MPCP signature, expanding the motherboard to
accommodate the Evasion and Masking chips, and so on. They
retained the commercial circuitry for features such as Hardening
and I/O speed and added modules for Response Increase. The
Matrix 1.0 rules reflected a parasitic decker subculture that
adapted the tools of a host culture-legitimate computer
usage-to its own ends.
Matrix 2.0 rules reflect significant advances in the capabili-
ties of illegal programmers and deckmeisters and illegal Matrix
technology. Even commercial machines such as the remarkable
Fairlight Excalibur lag well behind the SOTA today. As a result.
most deckers under Matrix 2.0 assemble their own decks or pur-
chase decks customized to their ownspecifications.
Deckmeisters are the most common source of customized decks,
but a few manufacturers produce such machines as well. (See the
archetype for the Deckmeister, p. 92. for further information.)
OPTIONAL RULE: BANDWIDTH
Bandwidth is the speed at which data moves over a con-
nection. Old-tech acoustical modems measured bandwidth in
"baud," or bits per second. A 2.400 baud modem could send of
receive 2,400 bits every second. With modern optical tech,
bandwidth is measured in MePS: megapulses per second.
Two kinds of bandwidth exist under Matrix 2.0 rules: icon
bandwidth and I/O bandwidth. Icon bandwidth carries com-
mands and sensory data to and from the deck. I/O bandwidth is
used to transfer data. Both types of bandwidth affect the size of
a decker's datatrail, which in turn affects how easily trace IC pro-
grams can locate a decker (see Jackpoints, p. 14 in Grids and
Hosts, and Trace Factor, p. 45 in Intrusion Countermeasures,
for information on using the optional bandwidth rule).
The gamemaster can use one or both forms of bandwidth in
his game. The optional icon bandwidth rule is simple, while the
I/O bandwidth rule is more complex, If the group chooses not to
use the optional bandwidth rules, assume that any grid connec-
tion operates at virtually instantaneous speeds. The I/O speed of
cyberdecks determines data-transfer rates, per the Shadowrun,
Second Edition Matrix rules

ICON BANDWIDTH
Icon bandwidth handles all the commands and ASIST signals
between the cyberdeck and the Matrix. Icon bandwidth is equal
to the sum of the decker's persona program ratings and the rat-
ings of all the utilities he has loaded into his deck's active mem-
ory. A deck's MPCP. utility options such as the stealth option.
and options that reduce memory size, such as the optimization
option, do not affect the icon bandwidth.
A decker must set his icon bandwidth at the beginning of a
Matrix run. The bandwidth remains constant throughout the
run-the decker cannot change its size without disconnecting
and starting a new run (see Suspending Icon Operations, for
the sole exception to this rule). If something destroys or reduces
the decker's program ratings, the icon bandwidth may be reas-
Signed, but it cannot be reduced to make his datatrail harder to
trace.
Before jacking in, deckers may reduce their icon bandwidths
by reducing their persona ratings lower than their actual ratings.
Any reduced ratings must remain at their reduced levels for the
rest of the run.
Deckers may not reduce the ratings of their utilities-utility
programs do not work at anything less than their full ratings.
Note that the actual size of the utilities in memory has no effect
on Icon bandwidth,
Sidewinder has an MPCP-6/5/3/4/4 deck. She has not reduced any
of her persona ratings to slim down her icon bandwidth, and so her
persona code has a bandwidth of 5 + 3 + 4 + 4-or 16 MePS.
Sidewinder also loaded Sleaze-5, Deception-4, Attack-6, and
Analyze-4 into her deck's active memory. That adds another 19 MePS
to the bandwidth, for a total of 35 MePS.
Sidewinder decides she wants to load another 5 Mp of utility code
for the run, which increases her icon bandwidth to 40.
I/O BANDWIDTH
V/O bandwidth handles uploads and downloads. A deck
with an I/O bandwidth of 10 MePS can upload or download 10
Mp of data per second. or 1.000 Mp of data in 100 seconds.
Deckers may change their deck's I/O bandwidths at any time by
performing Retrain operations.
Deckers may increase their deck's I/O bandwidths by re-
assigning MePS from their icon bandwidths. but the decker must
suspend his icon operations while doing so (see Suspending
Icon Operations).
Data Transmission
On a 20 MePS Matrix connection, downloading a 1.000 Mp
file takes 50 seconds. fast enough for legal users, but potential-
ly lethal for a decker trying to stay one jump ahead of black IC.
The same thing applies for deckers trying to upload doctored
datafiles or booby-trapped application programs.
To avoid such risky situations, most deckers keep their
bandwidths as small as possible. At the last possible moment,
they perform Retrain operations to their bandwidths, grab the
paydata, and drop the extra MePS as soon as they're done. High
bandwidth when the decker doesn't need it can be disastrous if
a trace IC program picks up his datatrail,
Utility Loads
Swap Memory operations enable deckers to load new
copies of utility programs onto their decks. This may be quite
convenient when changing the mix of utility programs on a deck
or replacing degraded or crashed utilities, The speed of a Swap
Memory operation depends on a deck's I/O bandwidth (see
System Operations, p. 117, for detalls),
Multiplexing
Multiplexing enables a decker to upload multiple utilities or
upload and download files or programs simultaneously. To mul-
tiplex, the decker divides his I/O bandwidth MePSs among dif-
ferent jobs any way he likes. For example, a decker with 100
MePS of I/O bandwidth could download files at a rate of 25
MePS and upload utility programs at a rate of 75 MePS.
Multiplexing is a Free Action and requires no tests.
Retraming
Retraining refers to the process of changing I/O bandwidth
during a Matrix run by using a Retrain operation. (See System
Operations, p. 117, for further information.)
Suspending Icon Operations
Deckers may re-assign their icon bandwidths to I/O band-
width by suspending their icon. However, icon bandwidth MePS
cannot be divided-the entire icon bandwidth must be re-
assigned. A decker with an icon bandwidth of 35 MePS, for
example, couldi re-assign 35 MeP'S to his I/O bandwidth, but not
15 MePS. Suspending Icon operations are Free Actions.
All persona ratings-MPCP. Bod, Evasion, Masking and
Sensor-drop to I when icon operations are suspended. No
matter how jazzed up the cyberdeck's Response Increases may
be, the decker gets only ID6 for Initiative. The decker also loses
extra initiative dice from reality filters and DNI controls. Lastly, all
utility program ratings are reduced by half (round fractions
down).
To restore the reduced ratings to their original values, the
decker must reallocate the bandwidth back to its original pur-
pose, which is another Free Action, However, the ratings do not
return to their original values until the decker's next available
action. For example, if a decker suspends icon operations and is
attacked by IC, he can release the I/O bandwidth at any time but
will have to fight off the IC with reduced persona and utility rat-
ings, and an Initiative based on those reduced values, until his
next action. This is a very dangerous proposition,

THE DECK SHOP
You won't find the deck shop at a shopping mall. No neolux
sign outside proclaiming "Highly Illegal Cyberdecks Sold Here."
The deck shop may be a backroom operation behind a legit
front, or an enterprise hidden behind samurai on retainer, mus-
cle-for-hire from the local organized crime outfit, or another.
equally deadly force. All part of the overhead, chummer,
Inside, the deck shop may be a devil rat's nest of
components, coding workstations, chip cookers and raw
optical crystals all spilling over benches and shelving. Or
the shop may be a complex that makes anyone else's
clean-and-neat look like nouveau pigsty, Personal style
rules in this field and competence counts more than
housekeeping
No matter how it's arranged, the equip-
ment adds up to a microtronics facility
worth 300.000 nuyen, If the deckmeis-
ter has been in business any length of
time, the deck shop contains a couple of
meganuyen worth of raw chips, logic
circuits, and auxiliary components like
bioscanners and ASIST interfaces. He
keeps local computing power with a few
gigapulses or so of addressable memory
on tap, with a workstation or a develop-
ment mainframe for the real top-line
coders. Chips and miniCDs with meg
after meg of source code are filed
according to some organizational
scheme-maybe neatly. maybe in
some chaotic fashion that only the
deckmeister can unravel.
Kids used to grow up dreaming
about Santa's workshop. This is what
deckers dream of when visions of
sugar plums dance through their
heads, even if the elves here are like-
ly to be heavily armed and prone to
mocking wordplay in Sperethiel.
Oh, and don't even think about
making a run on the place. The
thought of all that gear might be
tempting. but anyone who hits a
deck shop draws the wrath of the
shop's deckmeister and his muscle,
not to mention every decker who
depends on the shop. Drek, you
might as well sign over your cred to
the Universal Brotherhood and send
Lone Star a resumé of your runs-
you'll die more quickly.

Deckers use a wide variety of different types of programs. Persona programs define the
decker's online icon. Utility programs help him carry out system operations or serve as tools for
specific actions, Command set programs Instruct computers to perform specific jobs.
This section defines the various types of programs and provides rules for creating, or pro
gramming. them. The programming process applies to the creation of any type of program
from the deadliest attack utility to a simple spreadsheet.
Note that the rules presented in this section do not apply to persona and deck programs,
Rules for these programs appear in Cyberdecks. p. 81.

SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE
A source program, also called source code, is the original form
of a program. All source programs are written in programming lan-
guages intelligible to humans. Common programming languages
in the Sixth World Include HoloLISP. InterMod, MATCom, and
Oblong. These languages use different combinations of verbal or
written Input and dynamic icon manipulation to combine code
icons in virtual reality to literally construct programs,
After a programmer has written the source form of a pro-
gram, he can translate it Into an object format. Object format is
the actual "machine language," a series of linked holographic
constructs that constitute executable programs in Matrix tech-
nology. Object code is what is loaded into memory when a util-
ity runs or is cooked into an OCC.
A decker must have the source code of a program to
upgrade or modify the program. Object-code copies of pro-
grams cannot be used to change a program.
UTILITIES
Theoretically, a sufficiently godlike decker could command the
Matrix with nothing but his bare persona and skill alone. Less divine
netheads, however, must supplement their puny skills with utility
programs, Utilities come in four varieties: operational, special, offen-
sive, and defensive. Operational utilities apply to a decker's System
Tests. These prove especially useful when performing system oper-
ations. hence the name operational utilities. Special utilities perform
specific tasks in the Matrix. Offensive utilities are used to damage
opposing deckers, IC programs, and so on. Defensive utilities are
designed to prevent or reduce damage taken in cybercombat.
The multiplier value listed in each utility entry is used in soft-
ware tasks (see Cyberdecks, p. 81) and programming (see
Program Size. p. 101). Each listing also notes any system oper-
ations for which the utility may be used (see System Operations,
p. 108, for descriptions and rules for system operations), Some
utility descriptions also list options that may be used with the
utility (see Optional Rule: Utility Options, p. 102. for descrip-
tions and rules for utility options).
Unless otherwise noted, utility programs must be preloaded
into both active memory and the decker's online icon to work.
OPERATIONAL UTILITIES
Operational utilities help deckers execute system operations,
in the same way that a samurai's smartlink makes his gun a more
effective tool and his dermal armor backs up his armored jacket.
Operational utilities reduce the target numbers of a decker's
System Tests by the utility rating (see System Tests, p. 19 in
Matrix 2.0), Deckers may perform system operations without util-
ities (see System Operations, p. 108)-not having the right pro-
gram does not make the operation impossible, just more difficult.
All operational utilities may use the DINAB, one-shot, opti-
mization, and squeeze options.
Analyze
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Analyze IC, Analyze Icon. Analyze
Security, Locate IC
The analyze utility reduces the target numbers for System
Tests that identify IC, programs, and other resources or events
controlled by a host.
Browse
Multiplier: 1
System Operations: Locate Access Node, Locate File,
Locate Slave
The browse utility reduces the target numbers of Index Tests
made to locate specific data values or system addresses. Unlike
analyze and scanner utilities, which search for Matrix activity, the
browse utility works on the contents, or real-world functions, of
these data nodes.
Commhink
Multiplier: |
System Operations: Retrain, Tap Comcall
The commlink utility reduces the target numbers of any tests
that affect the decker's communications link,
Crash
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Crash Application, Crash Host
The crash utility does just what its name states; reduces the
target numbers for deckers' attempts to crash an application or
host.
Defuse
Multiplier: 2
The defuse utility reduces the target numbers of System
Tests made to defuse data bombs (see Data Bombs, p. 41).
Deception
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Graceful Logoff, Logon to (LTG, RTG, or Host)
Unless otherwise noted, the deception utility may be used
to reduce the target number of all Access Tests.
Decrypt
Multiplier: 1
System Operations: Decrypt Access, Decrypt File, Decrypt
Slave
The decrypt utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to defeat scramble IC programs.
Bisinfect
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Disinfect
The disinfect utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to destroy worm viruses.

Evaluate
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Locate Paydata
The evaluate utility sifts through large data samples to find
valuable loot. However, the utility degrades rapidly as market
demands change. The gamemaster rolls ID6 - 2, (round frac-
tions up) at the end of each run. The ratings of all evaluate pro-
grams degrade by the die roll result. This loss of effectiveness
occurs whether the decker is currently in play or not.
Deckers with source copies of evaluate utilities can upgrade
them per standard rules (see Upgrading, p. 83) or spend Karma
Points to restore them-I Karma Point restores | Rating Point to
the evaluate utility. This expenditure represents time spent pro-
gramming stock market analyses, rumors, news stories, shad-
owtalk, and other data into the evaluate program.
Mirrors
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Decoy
The Mirrors utility reduces the decker's target number for
System Tests used in the Decoy operation.
Read/Write
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Download Data, Edit File, Upload Data
The read/write utility reduces the decker's target number for
System Tests necessary for the operations listed, and also for any
other System Tests that may be needed when accessing, editing,
or loading/creating data in the Matrix.
Relocate
Multiplier: 2
The relocate utility reduces the target numbers of the spe-
cial tests made to defeat trace IC programs that have begun their
location cycles. (See Trace IC. p. 45. for further Information.)
Scanner
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Locate Decker, Locate Frame
The scanner utility reduces the target numbers of System
Tests made during operations that search for deckers, frames, or
their effects.
Spoof
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Command Slave, Edit Slave, Monitor Slave
The spoof utility reduces the target numbers for all System
Tests made to affect system and subsystem slaves.
Validate
Multiplier: 4
System Operations: Dump Log, Validate Passcode
The validate utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to implement administrative changes or read
administrative logs.
SPECIAL UTILITIES
Special utilities perform specific jobs. They cannot be pro-
grammed on the fly-if the decker does not have the program
pre-loaded. he cannot use it.
Compressor
Multiplier: 2
The compressor utility reduces the size of data being
uploaded or downloaded by 50 percent. The maximum file size
that the compressor utility can handle is Rating x 100 Mp. A 100
Mp file would be compressed to 50 Mp. halving the time it takes
to upload or download.
Decks must have enough active memory to accommodate
the decompressed size of a compressed utility being uploaded.
If the deck does not have adequate active memory. it cannot
perform the Swap Memory operation. For example, uploading a
compressed 100 Mp utility requires 100 Mp of free active mem-
ory, even though the program is crunched down to 50 Mp for
the upload.
Decompressing a file or program on the Matrix requires a
Complex Action. Compressed files and programs must be
decompressed before they can be read or used.
Sleaze
Multiplier: 3
The sleaze utility combines with a deck's Masking Rating to
enhance the deck's Detection Factor: (Masking + Sleaze) + 2.
round up.
Track
Multiplier: 8
The least reverent of the current publications focusing on the
Matrix describes the track utility as "trace IC for deckers." Most
sources attribute its development to a Renraku programmer who
decompiled Lone Star's beagle utility (see the Lone Star source-
book, p. 123). When the programmer's team produced an open-
ended search algorithm that put the original beagle design to
shame, a junior engineer on the staff disappeared into the shad-
ows with the source code. Within weeks, track utility programs
began showing up in the catalog files for Hacker Heaven and
other hot software sources,
In game play, the track utility is used as a combat program
against hostile deckers. After each successful attack, note the num-
ber of successes the attacking decker scored, The target decker
must make an Evasion (Track Rating) Test. If the Evasion Test fails
to yield an equal or greater number of successes, the attacker's
track utility locks onto the target decker's datatrail and begins its
location cycle, similar to trace IC (see Trace IC, p. 45). Divide 10
by the attacker's net successes to determine how many turns the
track utility needs to locate the target decker's jackpoint.
The target decker can try to escape the attacking decker by
logging off or jacking out. However, the track utility makes log-
off operations more difficult and may trace a jacked-out decker
in the same way as trace IC.

Targeted deckers can use the relocate utility against track
programs as against any trace program (see Relocate It. p. 46,
in Intrusion Countermeasures): When doing so. the targeted
decker makes his test against the attacking decker's Sensor
Rating instead of the system's Control Rating, If the relocate util-
ity succeeds, the track program fails completely. The attacker
must successfully attack the target decker again before using the
track utility against his opponent.
Of course, the target decker can always crash the attacking
persona, which would stop all its pesky programs,
OFFENSIVE UTILITIES
Offensive utilities inflict damage on the icons of deckers, IC
programs, running programs, datafiles-pretty much anything.
Some offensive utilities, such as the attack utility, are general, brute-
force destructive logics. Others are subtler and more limited.
A decker can program the attack utility on the fly (see
Cybercombat. p. 123) but cannot program any of the other
offensive utilities during a run.
The following descriptions specify the targets each utility
program can attack.
Attack
Multiplier
Light: 2
· Medium: 3
Serious: 4
Deadly: 5
Target: Deckers, frames. IC, SKs (see Artificial
intelligences. p. 138)
Options: Area, chaser. DINAB, limit, one-shot, optimiza-
tion, penetration, stealth, targeting
The attack utility. the least subtle offensive program, can be
programmed to inflict Light to Deadly damage. It samples the
instruction algorithms of the targeted icons and tries to Introduce
fairly coarse memory faults Into the icon's most frequently
accessed code segments, In cybercombat, that translates to a
direct attack on the Condition Monitor of the decker or IC icon.
The attack utility affects online icons only and has no effect
on a decker's meatbody or cyberdeck.
Black Hammer
Multiplier: 20
Target: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
Two years ago it was a rumor, last year a bleeding-edge
weapon on the decks of Lone Star's GridSec elites. This year the
so-called black hammer utility is cropping up in shadowy hands.
The black hammer utility is a black IC program that targets
the decker, not the deck. It can kill a decker without knocking his
cyberdeck off-line, so that the decker's jackpoint remains trace-
able. Black hammer lacks the blaster-like capabilities of main-
frame-driven black IC, but otherwise its effects are identical to
those of lethal black IC (see Black IC, p. 47 in Intrusion
Countermeasures).
The maximum rating for the black hammer utility is half the
programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up. The program can be
Installed in a semi-autonomous knowbot (SK) (see Artificial
Intelligences, p. 140), but not in a frame.
Hog
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
Hog is a virus weapon used by deckers against other deck-
ers. It Introduces simple, self-replicating code into the target
cyberdeck. The self-replicating code occupies the deck's active
memory and crashes running utilities.
Whenever an attacker makes a successful attack using a hog
program. the target makes an MPCP (Hog Rating) Test.
(Hardening reduces the target number for this test.) If the attack-
er wins the test, the hog utility reduces the rating of the highest-
rated program running on the targeted deck by I point for every
2 net successes the attacker achieved. The hog utility continues
to drain the same number of rating points at the end of every
subsequent Combat Turn until it has crashed the program. Then
the hog program repeats the process with the next highest-rated
program on the targeted deck. The hog program continues this
process until it has crashed every program on the targeted deck.
Programs Infected with the hog virus operate at their
reduced ratings until the hog virus crashes them completely.
A decker may purge a hog virus from an Infected deck by
spending a Complex Action and making a successful Computer
(Hog Rating - Hardening) Test. Increase the target number by the
original rating of the infected program. A single success on the
test wipes both the hog virus and the infected program from the
deck's active memory. A hog virus cannot be purged without
purging the infected program.
Deckers can use the Swap Memory operation to reload pro-
grams crashed by a hog virus or purged in the course of eliml-
nating the virus.
Hilljoy
Multiplier: 10
Target: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
The killjoy utility mimics non-lethal black IC, Killjoy pro-
grams inflict Stun damage to a decker's meatbody. Otherwise,
the killjoy utility is identical to the black hammer utility. The max-
imum program rating for a killjoy utility is half the programmer's
Computer Skill, rounded up.
Poison
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The poison utility attacks the Boct Rating of targeted personas
and behaves like acid IC. If the decker successfully attacks his target.
the target makes a Bod (Poison Rating) Test. Reduce the target's Bod
Rating by 1 for every 2 net successes the attacker achieved.

Restrict
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area. DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The restrict utility attacks the Evasion Rating of targeted per-
sonas. If the decker successfully attacks his target, record his suc-
cesses. The target makes an Evasion (Restrict Rating) Test,
Reduce the target's Evasion Rating by I for every 2 net success-
es the attacker achieved.
Reveal
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The reveal program attacks the Masking Rating of targeted
personas. The target makes a Masking (Reveal Rating) Test.
Reduce the target's Masking Rating by 1 for every 2 net suc-
cesses the attacker achieved.
Slow
Multiplier: 4
Target: IC
Options: Area. DINAB, one-shot. optimization, targeting
The slow utility reduces the execution speed of proactive IC.
Whenever a decker hits IC with the slow utility, make an
opposed Resistance (Slow Rating) Test for the targeted IC pro-
gram. If the IC test generates more successes, nothing happens
to it. If the slow Attack Test achieves more successes, the IC
loses 1 action for every 2 net successes the IC achieved, If the IC
has no actions left in a turn, it hangs-goes dead.
Note that temporarily disabling IC in this manner prevents
the IC from raising the decker's security tally. However, sup-
pressing the IC requires I point of Masking (see Suppressing IC,
p. 40 in Intrusion Countermeasures), If the IC is not suppressed
at the beginning of the next Combat Turn, the gamemaster rolls
Initiative for the IC per standard rules and the IC resumes where
it left off.
Reactive IC is not vulnerable to the slow utility, Trace IC Is
only vulnerable to the slow utility during the hunting cycle,
Steamroller
Multiplier: 3
Target: Tar Baby, Tar Pits
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The steamroller utility is a specific type of attack program
that Inflicts (Rating)D damage to tar IC programs. The steamroller
program is immune to the destructive effect of tar programs
(hence the name "steamroller"-it flattens tar). Crashing tar IC
programs with the steamroller utility increases the decker's secu-
tity tally unless the steamroller program is equipped with the
stealth option or the decker suppresses the IC per standard rules.
DEFENSIVE UTILITIES
Defensive utilities are designed to prevent, reduce, or repair
damage taken in cybercombat. Defensive utilities cannot be pro-
grammed on the fly. As with offensive utilities, add or subtract
the utility rating as indicated in the individual descriptions
Armor
Multiplier: 3
Options: Optimization
The armor utility reduces the Power of damage inflicted on a
decker's icon by the Armor Rating. For example, the armor utility
reduces all damage caused by killer IC or the attack utility, But against
black IC, it reduces only damage taken by the decker's icon-not
damage taken by the decker's meatboy, In short, the armor utility is
always effective against standard damage to the icon's condition
monitor but has no effect on collateral damage to the decker or his
deck, which must depend on Hardening for protection.
The armor utility loses | Rating Point every time the decker
takes damage-every time it fails to completely absorb damage
from a hit. Deckers can replace degraded armor utilities with fresh
copies of the program by performing the Swap Memory operation.
Camo
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The camo utility rating is added to the trace factor, which
impedes the attempts of trace IC to follow a deck's datatrail (see
Trace IC, p. 45. for more details). Additionally, the utility acts as
an operational utility for the Redirect Datatrail operation (see
System Operations, p. 117),
Cloak
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The cloak utility reduces the target numbers for Evasion
Tests made during combat maneuvers (see Combat Maneuvers,
p. 121 in Cybercombat),
Lock-On
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The lock-on utility reduces the target numbers for opposed
Sensor Tests made during combat maneuvers (see Combat
Maneuvers, p. 121 in Cybercombat),
Medic
Multiplier: 4
Options: DINAB, optimization
The medic utility is used to reduce the number of filled-in
boxes in the online icon's Condition Monitor. To use the utility, a
decker must spend a Complex Action and make a Success Test
using a number of dice equal to the medic utility rating. The tar-
get number is determined by the level of damage the icon has
suffered, as shown on the Medic Target Numbers Table.

Each success achieved on the Success Test repairs I wound
on the Icon's Condition Monitor. The program loses | Rating
Point each time it is used, whether it scores any successes or not.
Deckers may load a new copy of the medic utility and restore it
to its full rating by performing a Swap Memory operation.

Restore
Multiplier: 3
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization
The restore utility repairs damage to online icon attributes.
However, the program cannot repair permanent damage to the
actual persona chips caused by gray or black IC
To use the restore utility, the decker makes a Restore Test against
a target number equal to the rating of the program that caused the
damage If the icon has suffered damage from different programs,
such as Acid-4 and Poison-6 IC programs, use the higher rating.
The utility repairs | point of damage for every 2 successes
achieved on the Restore Test.
Shield
Multiplier: 4
Options: Optimization
Shield enables a decker to parry attacks in cybercombat
Whenever an attack affects the decker's persona, the decker may
make a Shield Test against a target number equal to the skill of
the attacker-Computer Skill for a decker, the system's Security
Value for IC programs, the DINAB value for a frame, and so on
Reduce the attacker's net successes by the number of successes
achieved on the Shield Test.
The shield utility is also effective as a defense against crip
pler and ripper IC attacks and any other attack In which the tar-
geted decker makes an opposed test, In these cases, the decker
makes a Shield Test and applies any successes from that test to
his successes on the opposed test
A shield utility loses | Rating Point every time it is used,
whether the Shield Test succeeds or not. Deckers may load fresh
copies of the utility by performing Swap Memory operations.
PROGRAMMING
All programming jobs are tasks, with specific base times
task periods, and tests needed to complete the work (see
Deckers and Tasks, p. 77, in Deckers).
The base time required to write a program equals the size
of the program multiplied by 2. The result is the base time

expressed in days. When calculating the base time, include in
the program size any size increases from program options.
To determine the task period for the job, make a Computer
(Program Rating) Test (the Software concentration or Matrix
Programming specialization may be substituted for the
Computer Skill). Then divide the base time by the number of suc-
cesses on the Computer Test. The result is the task period.
expressed in days. The Program Rating used in the Computer
Test is the actual rating of the program. Do not include changes
in the rating due to options.
PROGRAM RATINGS
The ratings of a deck's MPCP and frame cores may not exceed
the programmer's skill rating multiplied by 1.5. (The programmer
may use the Computer Skill, or Its Software concentration or
Matrix Programming specialization for programming.) The ratings
of all other programs may not exceed the skill rating itself.
PROGRAM SIZE
Determine a program's size by squaring its rating and multi-
plying the result by the program multiplier supplied in the pro-
gram description. The Program Size Table provides precalculated
sizes for programs of Ratings 1 through 14 and multipliers up to
10 (all program sizes are shown in megapulses), The table should
cover everything within reason, For unreasonable programs,
gamemasters must perform their own calculations. If modifiers of
some kind reduce the effective rating of a program below 1, use a
Rating of I to determine design time and memory requirements.
To find the size of a program on the table, find the pro-
gram's rating in the Program Rating column along the left side of
the table. Then read across to the correct Multiplier column. A
Rating 4 program with a multiplier of 6. for example, has a size
of 96 Mp.
PROGRAMMING TOOLS
The minimum setup needed for programming is a personal
computer with memory equal to or greater than the size of the
program being created. Personal computers cost 20 nuyen per
Mp of memory. Miniature decks cost more (see p. 259. SRII), IF
the personal computer has double the required memory, it con-
fers a + 1 task bonus (see Deckers and Tasks, p. 77, for further
Information on task bonuses),
The programmer can install a basic programming tool sulte in
his personal computer as well. The tool suite, called a programming
"kit." confers another - I task bonus and costs 1,500 nuyen.
A more elaborate programming package called a program-
ming "shop" confers a +2 task bonus. A programming shop
costs 15,000 nuyen and doubles the memory In the personal
computer. If a decker has already doubled the memory on his
personal computer, installing a programming shop effectively
quadruples the computer's memory and provides a +3 task
bonus (+1 for doubled memory, +2 for shop).
Using a mainframe host instead of a personal computer con-
fers a +4 bonus to programming tasks. However, the main-
frame's Security Value must be at least half the rating of the pro-
gram being created. Determine the cost of one day of program-
ming time on a mainframe by multiplying the mainframe's
Security Value by 100 nuyen, Companies that sell machine time
actually set up virtual machines with the necessary ratings and
have very active security, These companies do not hesitate to
revoke the passcodes of any customer who messes with the sys-
tem's security or tries to break out into native mode. Purchasing
a mainframe is out of the question for most deckers, but for the
more ambitious programmers, determine the purchase cost of a
mainframe by multiplying the mainframe's Security Value by
5.000.000 nuyen.

A programming suite installed in a mainframe adds a + 1 task
bonus to the mainframe host bonus. Programming time on a main-
frame that carries a programming suite is quite expensive, how-
ever. Determine the cost of one day of programming time by mul-
tiplying the mainframe's Security Value by 200 nuyen. Purchasing
a mainframe programming suite costs 300.000 nuyen-and of
course, the suite is useless without a mainframe to run it on.
Note that standard programming tool suites and shops can
be used only on personal computers. Mainframe programming
suites can only be used on mainframe hosts
Deckers may also "steal" programming time on a host. To
do so, the decker must perform a successful Validate Passcode
operation and plant a counterfeit passcode in the host, The deck-
er may then use the host until the host system administrators
notice the funky code and delete it. Of course, system operators
may also send their own deckers or heavy IC programs after the
offending programmer as well.

Selena needs to upgrade her offensive capabilities ia the Matrix.
She has a Computer Skill 8, and so she decides to write her own copy
of Attack-8S. First, she determines the size of the new program. The
rating on the new program is 8 and the Attack-S multiplier is 4, so the
equation looks like this: 82 x 4 = 256 Mp.
Next, she calculates the base time for the programming task: 256
x 2 = 512 days. To determine the task period, Selena makes a
Computer Test against a Target Number 8, the same value as the pro-
gram rating. Her test yields 2 successes, and she buys 2 more with
Karma Points, for a total of 4 successes. She then divides the base
time, 512, by 4, which gives her a task period of 128 days.
Selena has only limited funds available, so she buys herself a per-
sonal computer with 256 Mp of memory at a cost of 5,120 nuyen (256
x 20) and gets to work. She works on the program for 10 days, reduc.
ing the task period to 118 days, then takes a break for a few weeks
to pay the rent with a shadowrun.
With her cut of the take from the run, Selena drops another 5,120
nuyen to upgrade her PC to 512 Mp of memory. That's twice the mem-
ory she needs for the programming task, and so she receives a +1
task bonus. As a result, her next 10 days of work count as 20, reduc-
ing the task period to 98 days.
Unexpectedly, Selena comes into a bit more money, and so she
buys a programming kit for 1,500 nuyen. The kit provides another +1
task bonus. Combined with the bonus from the memory upgrade, that
produces a +2 task bonus. As a result, Selena's next 5 days of work
count as 15, reducing the task period to 83 days.
On her next run, Selena haggles with Mr. Johnson and gets 15 days
of programming time on a mainframe in lieu of a cash payment. (The
mainframe has a Security Value of 4, so it's adequate for creating the
Attack-8S program.) Mainframe access confers a +4 bonus, so her 15
days of work on the mainframe count as 75.
With only 8 days left in the task period, Selena returns to her per-
sonal computer. The PC provides a +2 bonus with its doubled memory,
and so she completes the programming task in 3 days.
Programming Teams
Characters may also work together in teams to produce pro
grams. The maximum size of a team equals half the Computer
Skill rating, rounded down, of the team member with the high-
est Computer Skill. The maximum rating of programs the team
may produce equals 1 plus the Computer Skill rating of the team
member with the highest Computer Skill. For example. a player
with a Computer Skill of 8 may form a programming team with
3 other players, and, if his is the highest skill in the group, the
team may produce programs with Rating 9 programs,
For the Computer Skill Test made to determine the task peri-
od, average the skills of the team members, rounding up, For
example, a team of three programmers, with skills of 6, 7, and 6
respectively, would make the test with an effective Skill Rating of 7.
The team cannot share tools and task bonuses. Each team
member must have the minimum required computing resources
to work on the program. Without task bonuses, each day of world
by the team reduces the task period by I day. To apply task
bonuses, add all the bonuses the team members possess and
reduce that total by the number of programmers on the team.
The result is the team's task bonus. For example, a team of 3
characters with task bonuses of +3, +2, and +3, would have a +5
group task bonus. Each day the team works on its program
reduces the task period by 6 days.
OPTIONAL RULE: UTILITY OPTIONS
Utility options are modifications that alter the basic opera-
tion of utilities. Generally. an option enhances a program's per-
formance in one way but limits Its performance in some other.
Options dramatically Increase the complexity of the Matrix
rules. The interaction of options and programs can become quite
intricate, and so gamemasters and players should become thor-
oughly familiar with the standard Matrix rules before introducing
utility options into their games. As always, gamemasters may
modify the options rules to best fit their games
Gamemasters may also introduce only specific utility
options into their games, However gamemasters should keep
utility and IC options balanced. Many of the utility options are
designed to counter specific IC options (see Intrusion
Countermeasures, p. 50), and allowing IC options without pro-
viding deckers with the means to combat them may produce
unbalanced and unsatisfying game play;

Under the standard Matrix rules, program size is fixed. The
size that governs the base time to write the program is the size
that the program occupies on a cyberdeck.
When using utility options, programs have two separate
sizes. The actual size measures the space the program occupies
on a cyberdeck. The design size is used to determine the pro-
gramming base time for the program,
Options may change the size of a utility program in one of
two ways. First, adding an option to a program may alter the
program's rating, thus altering its real size. Or an option may
increase a program's size by a percentage of its original size. In
certain cases, an option may reduce the actual size of the pro-
gram but increase the design size because it requires hyper-effi-
cient code
When layering multiple options on a single program, apply
any changes to the program's rating before calculating any per-
centage changes in its size. For example, If a set of combined
options add +2 and +3 modifiers to the program's rating and a
50-percent increase in its design size, apply the rating modifiers
first. Calculate the program size based on the new rating and
then apply the percentage increase. Cumulative percentage
changes are applied sequentially. For example, if a 180 Mp pro-
gram receives two 50-percent size reductions, first reduce the
180 Mp to 90 Mp. Then reduce the 90 Mp to 45 Mp.
OPTIONS AND RATINGS
Changes in the effective rating due to options do not count
against the maximum rating that a programmer can design. For
example, a programmer with a Computer Skill 8 can design any
utility with a Rating of 8, even if options raise its effective rating
for programming purposes.
Changes in the rating due to options also do not affect the
target number for the programming task. A Slow-4 utility with an
Area-4 option would have a Target Number of 4. not 8.
The maximum rating for options that themselves have rat-
ings, such as the area option, is the base rating of the program.
A Slow-4 program can have no more than Area-4, even if the
programmer's skill is higher.
OPTIONS AND COST
The price of a program depends on its base rating and
design size, For example, an Attack-6M program. without
options has a Base Rating of 6 and a design size of 108 Mp. The
program's street price equals its size, 108 Mp, multiplied by
200: 108 × 200 = 21,600 nuyen.
An Attack-6M(Skulk-4) program has an Effective Rating of
10 and a design size of 300 Mp. for a price of 60,000 nuyen.
AREA
Rating Modifier: +Area Rating
The area option enables a utility to engage multiple targets
on the host. The utility may engage a number of targets equal to
the area option rating. The decker makes one Attack Test and
applies the result to all specified targets. Increase the target
number for each target by the total number of targets.
For example, two corp deckers, A and B. are engaging an
intruder on a green host. The Target Number against legitimate
Icons on a Green system is 4. But decker A maneuvered suc-
cessfully to dodge an attack already and scored 2 extra success-
es, and so the target number against him receives a +2 modifier,
which raises it to 6.
The intruder engages the two corp deckers using an attack
program fitted with the area option. Against decker A, the Target
Number is 8 (6 - 2 for attacking 2 targets). Against decker 8, the
Target Number is 6 (4 + 2 for attacking 2 targets).
The Intruder's Attack Test yields a 7. 8, and 7. Therefore, he
achieves | success against decker A and 3 successes against
decker B.
Note that the defensive utility armor protects against utill-
ties fitted with the area option. Personas and IC programs carry-
ing the armor utility add a +2 modifier to their effective Armor
Ratings when attacked with utilities bearing the area option.
CHASER
Rating Modifier: +1
The chaser option negates the +2 target-number penalty for
attacks against IC programs with the shift defensive utility, However,
the chaser option adds an additional +2 target-number penalty to
attacks against IC programs with the shield defensive utility,
The chaser and penetration options cannot be placed on the
same utility.
DINAB
Rating Modifier: +DINAB Rating
DINAB (pronounced die-nab or dee-in-a-bee in Matrix
slang) stands for "decker in a box." The DINAB option gives a
utility program a built-in Computer Skill, equal to the DINAB rat-
ing. On any of his actions, a decker may spend a Free Action and
the utility runs itself.
For example, if a decker has the analyze, mirrors, and
browse utilities all equipped with DINAB, he can spend a Free
Action and two Simple Actions to execute all three utilities, even
if each program is sent to perform an operation that requires a
Complex Action.
Utilities cannot run two operations in the same action. In
addition, the decker cannot use the program himself during any
phase when it is running under DINAB.
The DINAB option degrades-loses | Rating Point-every
time it fails a test, because opposing software can analyze the
failure pattern, find gaps in the expert system's decision tree and
exploit those gaps. For these purposes, a test is failed any time
the DINAB option is defeated in a System Test opposed by the
host/system. The DINAB option also degrades (per this definition
of failure) whenever it fails to hit a target in cybercombat or the
target reduces to zero all damage the DINAB inflicts.
Whenever a program or frame under DINAB control fails a
test with results of all 1's, the utility or frame crashes, The deck-
er must reload a fresh copy before he can use it again. A Swap

Memory operation restores degraded DINAB options and
crashed DINAB-equipped programs and frames.
Frames can be equipped with DINAB, and smart frames
must have this option.
A decker can override the DINAB option on any of his pro-
grams or frames and use his own Computer Skill in its place. In
such cases, the decker must spend the type of action (Complex,
Simple, Free) normally required for using the program.
LIMIT
Rating Modifier: - 1
The limit option restricts the utility to a single type of target,
such as deckers. IC programs, frames, or SKs. The program is
useless against any other type of target.
Note that the limit option reduces the effective rating of the
program and thus reduces its actual size, as well. For example.
an Attack-6M (Limit: IC) program would have a Rating 5, and so
its size would be 52 x 3, rather than 62 x 3.
ONE-SHOT
Rating Modifier: Special
The one-shot option turns the utility into a single use pro-
gram. After the utility executes once, it vanishes, To use the utility
again, the decker must reload it with a Swap Memory operation.
The one-shot option reduces the actual size of the utility by 75
percent, but it Increases the utility's design size by 50 percent.
A decker can carry multiple copies of one-shot programs in
his deck's active memory, but tar baby and tar pit IC programs
are extremely effective against that trick. Whenever a tar pro-
gram trashes a utility carrying the one-shot option, it wipes out
all copies of the program in active memory.
OPTIMIZATION
Rating Modifier: Special
The optimization option reduces the actual size of a pro-
gram by 50 percent and increases its design size by 100 percent.
PENETRATION
Rating Modifier: + 1
The penetration option defeats the shield defensive utility.
However, against IC programs with the shift defensive utility, a
penetration-equipped utility suffers a +2 target number penalty for
tests against the IC target. That penalty is in addition to the -2 tar-
get number penalty afforded by the shield defensive utility.
The penetration and chaser options cannot be placed on the
same utility
SENSITIVE
Rating Modifier: Special
The sensitive option renders programs effective on only one
manufacturer's mainframes. For example, utilities equipped with the
Mitsuhama sensitive option work fine on computers manufactured
by MCT but are useless on computers manufactured by anyone else
Writing sensitive-equipped programs requires In-depth
knowledge of the Matrix architecture of different computer sys-
tems. For the Computer Test required in the programming task,
use an average of the programmer's ratings in Computer Siil
and Computer Theory or its Matrix Theory concentration.
The sensitive option reduces a utility's actual size by 75 per-
cent and increases its design size by 50 percent.
SKULH
Rating Modifier: +Stealth Rating
The skulk option enables a decker to eliminate or decrease
additions to his security tally prompted by crashing IC programs
(see Intrusion Countermeasures. p. 40). Whenever a decker
uses a skulk-equipped program to crash an IC program, reduce
the resulting security tally increase by the Skulk Rating
SQUEEZE
Rating Modifier: - 1
The squeeze option creates a self-compressed program. The
option reduces the utility's actual size by 50 percent for purpos-
es of uploading, as if it had been uploaded under the
Compression utility, However, a squeezed program cannot be
used until the decker spends a Complex Action to decompress
It. Decompressing the program requires no test.
If a squeezed program is uploaded using the compression
option, it receives the benefits of both options. The program's.
size is reduced by 75 percent. However, the decker must
decompress the program twice-one Complex Action to undo
the Compression option's effects, and a second Complex Action
to undo the effects of the squeeze option.
The squeeze rating modifier affects the utility's design size
only, not its actual size. Decks must have enough free active
memory to accommodate the utility in its decompressed form.
TARGETING
Rating Modifier: +2
The targeting option provides a -2 target-number modifier
for attacks made with targeting-equipped combat utilities.
COMMAND SETS
A command set consists of a simple program of orders that
a decker can leave on a host to be executed at a later time
Writing a command set may require one or more Subsystem
Tests, depending on the tasks the decker wants the host to per-
form. For example, If the decker wants the host to manipulate a
remote device-such as opening a security door at a specific
time or after receiving a specific signal-he needs to make a suc-
cessful Slave Test. If he wants the host to print something out of
erase a file. he must make a Files Test. If the decker wants the
host to open a SAN at a given time, he must make an Access
Test, and so on. The gamemaster determines the specific
Subsystem Test needed for the command set (when in doubt,
use a Control Test).
The deception utility reduces the target numbers for all
these tests (see Deception, p. 96).

More complex sequences of action require the decker to
write a program in advance and upload it. The design size of
such programs is ID6 x 20 Mp. After uploading the program,
the decker must make a successful Control Test to load the pro-
gram into the host,
Total any successes the host scores in opposing these
Subsystem Tests. Divide the sum Into 24. The result is the num-
ber of hours the program will continue to run on the host with-
out being detected and purged. If the host scores no successes,
the command set remains undetected for 48 hours.
FRAMES
Frames are combinations of decker-selected utilities, just as
constructs are combinations of IC programs. Frames may be
dumb or smart. Dumb frames are linked to the decker's persona
and only exist as long as the controlling decker remains active on
the host. Smart frames are capable of Independent existence in
the Matrix, whether their creator is logged on or not.
FRAME CORE
The frame core is the master control program for the frame.
Think of it as a box that holds the other programs of the frame,
The sizes of frame cores are determined using the same formula
as for other programs: Frame Core Rating2 x Frame Core
Multiplier. The size multiplier for all dumb frame cores is Z; the
multiplier is 3 for smart cores, Programmers must specify
whether a core will be dumb or smart when writing the core.
Frame cores may be equipped with any of the following
options: DINAB, optimization, and squeeze.
Core Ratings may not exceed the programmer's Computer
Skill x 1.5 (round fractions down). The following characteristics
are derived from the Core Rating
First. the combined ratings of the core's Bod, Evasion,
Masking, and Sensor attributes may not exceed the Core Rating
Any attribute may be set to 0. If the designing decker desires.
The Core Rating is used in place of an MPCP Rating for any
test requiring an MPCP Rating.
The Reaction attribute of a smart frame is equal to the
frame's Core Rating.

Finally, the combined ratings of all programs (not including
options) in the frame may not exceed the Core Rating. If Core
Rating Points have been allocated to the frame's Initiative, use
the reduced Core Rating for this purpose (see Smart Frame
Initiative, below).
Deckers may re-use frame cores with different combinations
of utility programs to make different frames. However, a core's
attributes may not be rearranged. To make a frame with different
attributes, the programmer must write a new frame core.
OInAB and Cores
All smart frame cores must be programmed with the DINAB
option, which acts as the core's Computer Skill. The addition of
the DINAB option increases the core's design rating by the
DINAB Rating
Dumb frames only execute programs on & decker's com.
mand. However, dumb cores may be fitted with the DINAB
option, which may trigger one of the frame's programs on a
given action
For both smart and dumb cores. the DINAB option rating
may not exceed the programmer's Computer Skill. The DINAB
Rating is set when the core is programmed and cannot be
altered later
Smart frame Initiative
Smart frames have their own Reaction and Initiative Ratings.
separate from the decker's ratings
An unmodified smart frame rolls: I DG for Initiative. However
the programmer can increase a smart frame's Initiative dice by
allocating part of its Core Rating to that purpose. Each point of
Core Rating allocated provides 1 additional Initiative die. Note
that whenever a frame's Core Rating is reduced, the ratings of
the frame's programs must be reduced so that their combined
total does not exceed the Core Rating
Core Rating Points must be allocated to Initiative at the time
the frame core is programmed antt cannot be changed later.
FRAME LOADING
Once a programmer has created a frame core, he can load
it with object code copies of any programs he has available. (The
programs need not carry the Link routine required under the
original SR Mattis rules.) These programs may be "plain vanilla"
ur equipped with options
The combined ratings mnot including Option Ratings) of
these programs may not exceed the frame Core Rating, If Core
Rating Points have Been allocated to the frame's Initiative, use
the reduced Core Rating for this purpose.
Programmers may not load "part of a utility into a frame
For example it the programmer has Deception 6, he cannot use
it to give the frame il copy of Deception-3. Programs don't work
that way. A pamal copy of a program isn't smaller-it is incom
plete jurist will not work
Loading programs onto a frame care is a task similar to pro
gramming First, the programmer musi calculate the Loading
Rating of the programs The Loading Rating is used only when
determining the task period for loading the programs. To calculate
the loading rate, combine the ratings of the programs and divide
by 2. The result is the Loading Rating. Do not include the ratings
of options or the frame core when calculating the Loading Rating.
Next, calculate the loading size
Loading Rating2 - loading size in Mp.
Then, determine the loading base time:
Loading size x 2 = loading base time in days
Now, make a Computer Test against the average rating of
the programs to be loaded. The Software concentration or Matrix
Programming specialization of the Computer Skill may be subst !-
tuted for this test. Use the number of successes to calculate the
loading task period:
Loading base time + Computer Test successes - task period
in days
The actual size of a frame is the actual size of the frame core
plus the actual size of all programs and options loaded on it.
Genie has a 12-point smart frame core with a DINAB-8 option. She
allocates 2 Core Rating Points to the frame's Initiative, so she has 10
points left over for programs.
She wants a self-directing Matrix weapon, a killer drone program,
so she decides to load Attack-6S and Cloak-4 programs on the frame.
That calculates the loading rating as follows:
(10 + 2)2 - 25
That gives her a loading base time of 50 days (25 x 2). She achieves
5 successes on her Computer Test, so the loading task period is 10
days (50 + 5).
Genie's smart frame is a husky program when completed: 1,200 Mp
for the core, 144 Mp for Attack-65, 48 Mp for Cloak-4 -- tor a total of
1,392 Mp.
RUNNING A FRAME
To run a frame, a decker first must log on to a host and then
upload the frame As soon as the uploart completes, the hame
stans running Compressed of squeezeit frames must be decom
pressed before they can run
DUMB FRAMES
Giving a command to a dumb frame is a Simple Action This
applies even it the frame program is used to perform a Complex
Action. For example. IL a Frame includes an analyze program, the
tlecker could use the frame to perform an. Analyze Security oper
ation as a Simple Action
The fame then carries out lis orders A dumb frame cannot
repeat an action. For example. a decker cannot tell .cdumb frame
to attack an IC program until it wins-he can only tell it to attack
once; A second attack requiresa second command to the frame
If & decker logs off a host, any dumb fames he K running
crash. They do not follow the decker to other systems or guds.
Dumb frames may serve a number of purposes, including
functioning as a decoy triggering an event, nt carrying
weapon

Decoy frames
Any dumb frame can act as a combination scout "drone".
and decoy, These so-called decoy frames can perform various
Analyze operations and may be fitted with scanner utilities and
used for Locate Decker operations. (See System Operations, p.
114. for further Information.]
If a decker performs a Decoy operation on a host or grid sys-
tem, the system directs all security measures against the decoy
frame as long as the decker himself remains inactive. The decker
uses his own Computer Skill to make tests for the frame, but all
attribute-related scores depend on the decoy frame's ratings, not
his own. Only the utilities loaded into the frame can be
employed during the Decoy operation.
If the frame's actions create a security tally that triggers IC
programs, the IC programs go after the decoy frame, not the
decker's persona, Because the frame has the same dlatatrail ais
the decker, this doesn't help the decker's situation when facing
trace IC
Once a decoy frame crashes, the host system and any active
IC programs react ro subsequent actions by the decker per stan
dard rules.
Event Triggers
Deckers can also create dumb frames to notify them of spe-
cific events in the host system. The decker must be present on
the same system to receive the frame's message This may
require a Null operation (see System Operations, p. 117).
To serve as an event trigger, the frame needs a Sensor
attribute and analyze and/or scan utilities. The attribute and util-
Ities must have ratings equal to or exceeding half the host's
Security Value. An analyze utility is needed to detect events
caused by the host or its programs. The frame must contain a
scanner utility to detect events caused by other deckers or legit-
imate users on the host.
Deckers may Include any other utilities on the frame if addi-
tional capacity remains available.
Weapon Carriers
Deckers often load frames with offensive utilities and use
these "weapon carriers" as auxiliary weapons in cybercombat.
Such frames enable a decker to carry weapons that do not take
up active memory or his icon bandwidth. Of course, if the frame
crashes, the decker loses the programs. Each attack with a
weapon-carrier frame requires a Simple Action.
SMART FRAMES
Smart frames can perform any action a dumb frame can. In
addition, smart frames have their own "skill" (their DINAB
Rating), and their own Response and Initiative ratings. The deck-
er uses a Free Action to give the smart frame a basic order, and
the frame then carries out that order on its own.
For example. a decker can order a smart frame equipped
with combat utilities to find and destroy an icon. The frame has
its own actions In game terms, the player who controls the
decker runs the frame as well, but the frame's actions do not
require any attention from the decker and do not use up any of
the character's actions.
UPGRADING
Deckers may upgrade any program described in this sec-
tion-with the exception of command sets-by raising the pro-
gram's rating. The programmer must have a copy of the pro-
gram's source code to upgrade the program.
Upgrading programs is a programming task. To determine
the base time for an upgrade, first determine the base time for
the program as if creating the program from scratch (see
Programming, p. 100). Then calculate the base time for writing
the current program version. Then subtract the current version
base time from the upgraded version base time. The result is the
base time needed for the upgrade task,
Next. determine the task period. Begin by making a
Computer Test against the rating of the upgraded program.
Divide the upgrade task base time by the test successes. The
result is the task period in days. The rest of the programming
process proceeds per standard programming rules (see
Programming. p. 100),
Deckers may also upgrade a program by adding options to
the program, rather than increasing the program's rating
BUYING PROGRAMS
Deckers can purchase any of the programs described in this
section. A program's price is determined by its rating and design
size. Option ratings do not affect these prices, Make Availability
Tests using the Etiquette (Matrix) Skill
All prices given represent the cost of object code and a copy
of the source code. Reduce prices by 25 percent for object-code
only programs.
Under the Virtual Realities 2.0 rules, calculate prices for all
programs-Including personaware and utilities-using the for-
mulas on the Program Prices Table. The distinctions for utility and
persona programs in the original SR Matrix rules were based on
the cost of the personaware chips. In the VR 2.0 rules, the
firmware price has been unbundled from the software price.

A system operation represents a command of series of commands that a decker gives to a
host or grid to perform a specific task. Almost any task a decker may perform in cyberspace Is
expressed as a system operation, This section covers most of them, If a decker wants to perform
some action not covered in the listed system operations, gamemasters may create their own

OPERATIONS DESCRIPTIONS
The following text pro
Tent set of available System opptatti
feelfree to invent additional
ler deckers proposent all

ANALYZE HOST
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
An Analyze Host operation enables a decker to analyze the
ratings of a host. For each success in the Control Test, the deck-
er chooses one of the following pieces of information, which the
gamemaster supplies:
* the host's Security Rating (code and value)
* the rating of any one of the five subsystems on the host
· whether the apparent host is a VM (see Virtual Machines,
p. 34 of Grids and Hosts)
Seven or more successes gain the decker all the available
Information about the host. Note that a decker must be on the
host to run an Analyze Host operation on it-no sneak previews
from the grid.
ANALYZE IC
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Free
The Analyze IC operation enables a decker to identify any
specific IC program that he has located (deckers may locate IC
programs by performing Locate IC operations or by coming
under attack from the IC program). If the Analyze IC operation
succeeds, the decker learns the type and rating of the IC pro-
gram and any options or defenses it carries. If the IC is a trace IC
program, the decker also learns whether the trace program is in
Its hunting or location cycle. If the IC program is in its location
cycle. the decker learns how many turns remain before it com-
pletes the cycle.
ANALYZE ICON
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Free
The Analyze Icon operation scans any icon and identifies its
general type: IC, persona, frame. application, and so on. The
decker may reduce the Control Test target number by his Sensor
Rating and any analyze utility he is running. However, the test
target number may not drop below 2, regardless of the decker's
combined Sensor and analyze utility ratings.
ANALYZE SECURITY
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Simple
The Analyze Security operation tells the decker the current
Security Rating of the host, the decker's security tally on the host
(Including any tally points accrued by the test for Analyze
Security), and the host's alert status.
ANALYZE SUBSYSTEM
Test: Targeted Subsystem
Utility: Analyze
Action: Simple
An Analyze Subsystem operation identifies anything out of
the ordinary about the targeted subsystem. The operation iden-
tifies the presence of trap doors, worms, scramble IC programs,
or other defenses or system tricks present on the subsystem.
CONTROL SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Spoof
Action: Complex
The Control Slave operation enables a decker to take control
of a remote device controlled by the host's Slave subsystem.
Remote devices range from simple automatic security doors and
elevators to entire automated factories full of robotic assemblers.
If the decker is attempting to take control of a manufactur-
ing or scientific process controlled by the Slave subsystem, he
must make the Slave Test with the average of his ratings In
Computer Skill and a B/R or Knowledge Skill that applies to the
process. For example, a decker attempting to take control of an
automated medical lab would make the test with an average of
his Computer and Biotech skills, or Computer and Medicine
skills, or Computer and some similar skill. Be strict about appro-
priate skills here, especially if the decker is attempting a task that
might call for some obscure skill specialization.
The Control Slave operation is a monitored operation.
CRASH APPLICATION
Test: Appropriate Subsystem
Utility: Crash
Action: Simple
The Crash Application operation shuts down one of the
host's application programs. Application programs include any
legitimate program other than IC or decking programs.
Applications take care of regular business on a host-you know,
the boring stuff,
The Subsystem Test for the operation depends on the appli-
cation targeted. If the decker is targeting an application program
that controls a factory or a security Installation, for example, the
decker would make a Slave Test. The Crash Application operation
may also be used to shut down a legitimate user's session, which
is a function of the Files subsystem. If in doubt, the gamemaster
can always ask the character to make a Control Test.
Crash Application operations have no effect on IC programs,
frames, constructs, or other deckers.
CRASH HOST
Test: Control
Utility: Crash
Action: Complex
The Crash Host operation is the decker's "doomsday
weapon." A successful Crash Host operation forces the host to
shut down, dumping any hostile users as well as the decker
himself (unless, of course. he first performs a Graceful Logoff
operation).

Host systems do not shut down instantly. If a Crash Host
operation succeeds, divide the decker's successes into 10 Combat
Turns. The result is the number of turns that elapse before the host
shuts down. At the end of each Combat Turn of this countdown.
the host system tries to abort the process-make a Security Value
Test against the decker's MPCP Rating. If the test succeeds, the
shutdown process stops and the host stays up.
During the countdown to a crash, reduce the ratings of all IC
programs running on the host by 2, These reductions reflect the
drain on system resources caused when the host allocates
resources to the shutdown instruction. All reduced ratings return
to normal immediately if the crash is averted.
Note that a decker cannot abort a shutdown countdown
caused by a Crash Host operation he has performed.
A shutdown wipes out all frames, command sets, and other
programs left behind by the decker. The host computer reboots
itself, which automatically cleans all its code, deletes security tallies
and alerts, and restarts the host with all its basic ratings and values.
Typically, system administrators recognize decker-insti-
gated crashes and increase security measures when restarting
host systems.
DECOY
Test: Control
Utility: Mirrors
Action: Complex
The Decoy operation creates a "decoy" copy of the decker's
Icon, This decoy may draw the "attention" of proactive IC pro-
grams that target the decker, Record the number of successes
the decker achieves on the Control Test. Whenever a proactive
IC program attempts to attack the decker, roll ID6. If the die roll
result is less than the number of the decker's Control Test suc-
cesses, the IC attacks the decoy instead of the decker's real icon.
In the event of a tie, decoys fool IC programs.
Decoys have no special defenses and no damage resistance,
so they take full damage when hit. Decoys disappear when their
Condition Monitors fill up.
Note that decoys are not effective against trace IC.
Decoy operations may be used to lock the attention of IC
programs on frames (see Frames, p. 105).
DECRYPT ACCESS
Test: Access
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt Access operation defeats scramble IC programs
guarding access to a host. IC programs on a scrambled SAN must
be defeated with a Decrypt Access operation before a decker can
perform a Log-On to Host operation on a scrambled SAN.
DECRYPT FILE
Test: Files
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt File operation defeats scramble IC programs on a
file. Deckers must perform successful Decrypt File operations on
scrambled files before performing other operations on such files.
DECRYPT SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt Slave operation defeats scramble IC programs
on a Slave subsystem. A decker cannot make Slave Tests against
à scrambled Slave subsystem until he has performed a success-
ful Decrypt Slave operation on the subsystem.
DISINFECT
Test: Appropriate Subsystem
Utility: Disinfect
Action: Complex
The Disinfect operation destroys worm virus programs on a
specific subsystem. The decker makes the operation test against
the targeted subsystem-if a host's Files subsystem has worm
programs, he makes a Files Test, for example.
DOWNLOAD DATA
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Download Data operation copies a file from the host to
the decker's cyberdeck. The data moves at whatever I/O band-
width the decker has allocated. It may be transferred to active
memory, storage memory, or even off-line storage.
The Download Data operation is an ongoing operation that
continues until the data transfer is completed, the decker logs off
or is crashed, or the decker terminates the download early. If the
operation is terminated before the transfer is completed. It cre-
ates a corrupted copy of the file, which is worthless.
However, if the file contains information that is particularly
important to an adventure, the gamemaster may allow partially
completed downloads to produce damaged, yet readable file
copies, The base time to reconstruct a damaged file is calculated
as follows:
(full file size in Mp divided by amount of
data downloaded in Mp) x 2.
The result is in days. Once a damaged file is reconstructed, the
gamemaster determines whether the file contains the pertinent
information by dividing the size of the downloaded file by the ful
size of the original file.
For example, if a decker manages to copy 10 Mp of a 100 Mp
file, the base time for reconstructing the file is (100/10) x 2, or 20
days. Dividing 10 by 100 yields .10. so there is a 10 percent
chance that the copied file contains the pertinent information.
DUMP LOG
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex

The Dump Log operation is an interrogation operation that
enables & decker to open and read host-access logs, The logs
record the Identities of legal users who accessed the system,
which files they accessed, which programs they ran, and so on.
System logs also note any Intrusions or suspected intrusions that
the host observed-basically, any decker runs that triggered a
security response. However, Intrusions may also show up on sys-
tem logs as fatal program aborts, hardware glitches, and other ran-
dom system errors- particularly if they are successful, sneaky runs,
If Information on a system log is crucial to an adventure, the
gamemaster should prepare the log in advance. If log entries are
not particularly Important to an adventure, the gamemaster can
Improvise them.
Deckers may also download system logs onto their
cyberdecks for later analysis or documentation. The size of a log
covering a 24-hour period is calculated by multiplying the host's
log size multiplier by 100. The result Is in Mp
LOG SIZE MULTIPLIERS

EDIT FILE
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Edit File operation enables a decker to create. change.
or erase a datafile. Small changes (approximately one line of
print or the equivalent of one short form of some kind) can be
made directly on the host by performing this operation. Before

replacing larger amounts of data, the decker must prepare the
new material off-line first, then upload it and perform an Edit File
operation to insert it into the file. Any uploaded information may
be inserted with a single Edit File operation, regardless of its size.
A successful Files Test creates new files. Because these files
do not have legal headers, the operating system may erase them
at any time.
Deckers also can use Edit File operations to make copies of files
on the same host. Thus, deckers can copy a file from a particularly
secure datastore, stash it on a less secure part of the same host and
retrieve it at a later time. When using the Edit File operation in this
manner, a decker must make two Subsystem Tests. The first test is
a Files Test. The second test is made against the subsystem that
controls the location where the decker hid the copied file.
After altering, Inserting, or deleting a file, a decker must
make a Computer Test against a target number equal to the
host's Files Rating x 2 to determine if the host notices his work.
The decker may add his deck's Masking Rating to his Computer
Skill Rating for this test. If the test succeeds, the host does not
notice the changes. If the test fails, it does.
Deckers may make the same Computer (Files Rating x 2)
Test to determine whether a host or another decker has tam-
pered with a file. In this case, the decker may add his deck's
Sensor Rating to his Computer Skill for the test. If the test suc-
ceeds, the decker recognizes signs of tampering in the file.
Keep in mind that any time a decker deletes a host file, the
gamemaster must consider the impact on the adventure in
progress and decide whether back-up copies of the file exist.
EDIT SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utilities: Spoof
Action: Complex
The Edit Slave operation is a monitored operation that
enables a decker to modify data sent to or received from a
remote device controlled by the host's Slave subsystem, For
example, a decker could perform Edit Slave operations to alter
video signals or sensor readings from a computer-controlled
security system or alter readings being sent to a console or sim-
ulator.
GRACEFUL LOGOFF
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Graceful Logoff operation enables a decker to discon-
nect from a host and the LTG where he logged on to the grid
without experiencing dump shock.
In addition, a successful Graceful Logoff operation clears all
traces of the decker and his actions from the security and mem-
ary systems of the host. The operation also leaves the decker
Invulnerable to trace IC programs after he has disconnected (see
Trace IC, p. 45 of Intrusion Countermeasures).
INVALIDATE PASSCODE
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex
The Invalidate Passcode operation enables a decker to erase
a single passcode from a host's security tables. A decker may
also use the operation to trash the host's entire passcode list so
that no legitimate users can get on using passcodes. This forces
corp deckers to log-on to the host by illegal means and puts
them on a more even footing with the intruding decker. When a
decker attempts to wipe out an entire passcode list, add a +4
modifier to the target number for the decker's Control Test.
LOCATE ACCESS NODE
Test: Index
Utility: Browse
Action: Complex
The Locate Access Node operation is "directory assistance"
Sixth World-style. It enables a decker to find the codes of LTGs
that provide access to the hosts he wants. The operation also lets
him locate commcodes for regular trid calls.
Modify the target number for the Index Test according to
the decker's stated goal. For example, if all he knows is a com-
pany or individual name-"I'm looking for a Mitsuhama sys-
tem"-apply a +1 modifier to the target number. If his goal is a
bit more specific-"I'm looking for a Mitsuhama public-relations
system"-do not modify the target number. If he has a definite,
specific goal-"I'm looking for the Mitsuhama public-relations
system out of the Mitsu office in Bellevue on LTG 5209"-apply
a -1 modifier to the target number,
Once a decker has located an LTG code, he need not repeat
the Locate Access Node operation to find the host in future-
unless its owners change the address, of course.
The Locate Access Node operation is an interrogation operation.
LOCATE DECKER
Test: Index
Utility: Scanner
Action: Complex
The Locate Decker operation is a two-step process. The deck-
er makes the standard System Test and then a Sensor Test, The
decker locates any other deckers whose Masking attributes are
equal to or lower than his Sensor Test results. In addition, he
knows if they log off or jack out. If a targeted decker is running a
sleaze utility, add its rating to the targeted decker's Masking
Rating to determine if the testing decker locates the target decker
Located deckers may break contact by maneuvering (see
Combat Maneuvers, p. 121).
Friendly deckers who wish to make their presences known
to each other may do so automatically.
LOCATE FRAME
Test: Index
Utility: Scanner
Action: Complex

The Locate Frame operation locates any smart frames or SKs
running on the host. The operation is not effective against IC con-
structs because the host protects them from application index-
ing. However. constructs may be located with the Locate IC
operation (see Locate IC, below).
LOCATE FILE
Test: Index
Utility: Browse
Action: Complex
The Locate File operation is an interrogation operation that
searches for specific datafiles. To use the operation, the decker
must have some idea of what he is looking for-"valuable
data" is not enough. In fact, that is a different operation (see
Locate Paydata).
If the operation succeeds, the decker knows the system
location of the file:
Distributed databases can make for a real scavenger hunt
through the Matrix. Here's a simple example: Host A contains one
master copy of a database; Host B contains subordinate files that
point back to this master, perhaps through a series of two or three
other hosts. At the level of computer access involved in decking, a
decker must get to the master database to extract or edit informa-
tion. So a decker on Host B performs a Locate File operation and
finds the reference he is looking for, He opens the file to do a
Download Data operation and discovers it is actually a subordinate
file pointing him to another host. He switches to that host-the
subordinate files contain the LTG address of the next computer in
line-and goes through the process again, only to find that he has
to go to yet another host. The gamemaster can roll ID6 to deter-
mine how many of these links exist in a given chain of files.
Cybersushi is on a Green-6 host with Index-11. Sushi's Computer
Skill is 6, and he's running a Browse-5 utility. During the present
adventure, Sushi's chummers came across a reference to a project
at Nasticorp that might endanger their friends in an ork tribal squat
over in the Barrens. So Sushi broke into this low-level computer at
Nasticorp to look for more details. Sushi and the gamemaster might
engage in a dialog that goes something like this:
Sushi: OK, I am looking for any files with references to the Redmond
orks or projects in the Barrens.
Gamemaster: That's kind of broad. OK, roll away.
[The player makes the operation Index Test. He rolls 605 (Computer
Skill) against a Target Number 7 (Index Rating 11 - Browse Rating 5 +
1 target modifier for over-broad question). The gamemaster makes an
opposed Security Test for the host against the player's Masking
attribute. The player achieves 3 successes, the Security Test nets 2.
Sushi emerges with 1 success.)
Gamemaster: There's a couple of references that look promising.
Sushi: Any of them talking about project schedules, budget, anything
to do with specific plans?
Gamemaster: Ah-now that's useful. Let's see.
(Sushi and gamemaster repeat the Index Test and Security Test.
Sushi's question is more specific, so the gamemaster applies a -1 tar-
get modifier to the Index Test. Sushi achieves 4 successes and the
Security Test nets only 1. That leaves Sushi with a total of 4 success-
es for the operation.)
Gamemaster: Right-the keyword seems to be Project Nightwalker.
Something in some e-mail in the secure datafiles.
Player: Great. Find the message file, I want to read it.
At this point, the search for a specific file is really enough-and
asy successes by Sushi will hit 5 total successes anyway. The
gamemaster has already decided that this host is not secure enough
to contain the full details of Nasticorp's Incredibly evil scheme, but
the e-mail contains an origin address on a tougher host, where they
keep the real paydata. That host also contains the names of respon-
sible individuals on the Nasticorp roster who can be located through
the personnel databases and Invited to unburden their consciences to
Sushi's muscular friends back in the physical world.
LOCATE IC
Test: Index
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
The Locate IC operation follows the same rules as the Locate
Decker operation. However, the decker automatically locates the
IC program(s) if his System Test succeeds-he need not make a
Sensor Test. The IC program(s) remains located unless it maneu-
vers to evade detection.
LOCATE PAYDATA
Test: Index
Utility: Evaluate
Action: Complex
The Locate Paydata operation is an interrogation operation
that enables a decker to search a host for marketable data. For
each net success the decker achieves on the operation Index
Test, the operation locates 1 point of paydata in the host (the
gamemaster assigns a paydata volume to every host-see
Mapping Matrices, p. 65), The operation continues until the
decker stops performing it or locates all the paydata on the host.
Once located, paydata must be downloaded in its entirety, If a
file contains 20 Mp. all 20 Mp must be downloaded or the swag is
useless. Paydata is fenced per standard SR rules (see p. 188. SRID).
LOCATE SLAVE
Test: Index
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
The Locate Slave operation follows the same rules as the
Locate File operation (see Locate File). The operation is used to
determine system addresses for specific remote devices con-
trolled by the host. A vague Inquiry would be. "Find all the secu-
rity cameras controlled by this computer." A very specific inquiry
would be. "Find the camera that monitors the eastern stairwell
door on the third floor.
On the other hand, most hosts are likely to control far fewer
slaves than files. 50 a decker need achieve only 3 successes on
his Index Test to locate the desired system. After locating the
slave node, a decker can perform operations such as Command
Slave and Read or Write Slave for that node.

LOGON TO HOST
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Logon to Host operation simply consists of an opposed
Access Test against the Access Rating of the host. Apply any
appropriate modifiers to the test and remember to begin count-
ing the decker's security tally with any successes on the host's
Security Test.
The decker will not know the host's Access Rating until he
takes his first crack at the log on. At that point, the rating will be
all too evident. No need to make it a big secret.
Once the Access Test succeeds, the virtual landscape of the
computer becomes visible. If the decker is accessing a host
directly through a work station, his Icon may appear in scenery
corresponding to an I/O port (see p. 166, SRII), Of course, with
the preponderance of sculpted systems in the Matrix today, the
scene may be something quite unique
Gaining access to a host through a remote device means the
decker's icon enters the host at a slave controller, and access
through the console puts the decker in the heart of the CPU node.
These virtual locations do not affect the decker's tests, but are pro-
vided as guidelines when describing the scene to the decker,
Once on the host, the decker can perform all of the opera-
tions that take care of biz-analyzing the host and its defenses,
looking for paydata, fiddling files, the whole bit.
LOGON TO LTG
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Logon to LTG operation simply consists of an opposed
Access Test against the Access Rating of the LTG. Apply any
modifiers for the jackpoint and bandwidth (see jackpoints, p. 28.
and Bandwidth, p. 90) and remember to begin counting the
decker's security tally on the grid with any successes from the
grid's Security Test. If the decker loses the test, his log-on
attempt fails, The decker can try again. but his security tally
remains on the grid for some time (typically, public LTGs
"remember" unauthorized access attempts for 1D3 x 5 minutes).
The decker also can switch to a different jackpoint before his next
log-on attempt-which means the grid will have to start a new
security tally for him.
Once the decker succeeds in the opposed Access Test, his
icon appears in the familiar virtual landscape of the LTG, From an
LIG. the decker can log on to the RTG that controls the LTG, or
on to the PLTG attached to this LTG (if he knows its address), or
to any host attached to the LTG (if he knows the host's address),
LOGON TO RTG
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
Once he has logged on to an LTG, a decker can log on to its
controlling RTG by performing a Logon to RTG operation. He
must perform this operation if he wants to connect to a different
LTG on the same RTG, or to a different RTG altogether.
To perform the operation, the decker makes an Access Test
against the RTG's Access Rating. Remember that "local" changes
In the LTG system ratings (see p. 26) will not carry over to the RTG.
The gamemaster can assign temporary changes to the RTG ratings.
of course. If a decker is accessing a grid such as Germany's. keep
In mind that the RTG can have different ratings from its dependent
LTGs, and use the RTG's Access Rating for the test.
Remember that an RTG maintains the same security tally for all
a decker's activities on any LTGs it controls, as well as the RTG itself.
Once the decker is on the RTG, he can perform a Logon to
LTG to reach any LTG attached to the RTG, or a Logon to RTG
operation to reach any other RTG in the world. The decker can
also perform Search RTG and Trace/Tap Call operations.
MAKE COMCALL
Test: Files
Utility: Commlink
Action: Complex
A decker on an RTG can make a call to any commcode on
an LTG controlled by that RTG by performing a Make Comcall
operation. But this operation is not just a way to beat payphones.
The decker can make a call, then move to another RTG and make
a call to a number under its control, then link the two together.
A decker can move to multiple RTGs in this manner, building a
secure conference call. Each call the decker links together
requires another opposed Files Test.
Deckers can be licensed to provide this service on various
RTGs. This means they get a passcode from the RTG vendor that
authorizes this operation. In that case, no tests are needed to
make the calls or link them together. This license is usually
restricted to corporate deckers.
Treat any trace routines run by the grid against the call as
trace IC, The decker's Trace Factor is the Trace Factor for the call.
All the tricks that work against trace IC, such as Redirect Datatrail
operations, can be used to make the call more secure.
The Trace Comcall operation cannot trace this kind of call.
but another decker could use the track utility to try to locate the
commcodes involved in the call. (See Tap Comcall, p. 118, for
further information.)
In addition, the decker can detect any taps or tracers on the
commlines by making a Sensor (Device Rating) Test. He can neu-
tralize them with an Evasion (Device Rating) Test.
Deckers often arrange secure calls, or prepare frames that
can build them, as a profitable sideline. The typical charge is 100
nuyen per caller per minute.
The Make Comcall operation is a monitored operation.
MONITOR SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Spoof
Action: Simple

The Monitor Slave operation is a monitored operation that
enables the decker to read data transmitted by a remote device, He
can listen to signals from audio pickups, watch feeds from security
cameras, examine readouts on a computerized medical scanner
hooked up to the host, and so on. As long as he maintains the oper-
ation. he receives constant updates from the device.
NULL OPERATION
Test: Control
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The gamemaster may require a decker to perform one or
more Null operations whenever the decker is waiting for some-
thing to happen, whether it is an event on the Matrix, the end of
an ongoing operation, or something else that involves hanging
around in cyberspace without making System Tests, The
gamemaster may also call for a Null operation if a decker is doing
anything that requires actions but not System Tests, such as
maintaining an Edit Slave. The gamemaster may secretly perform
these operations on behalf of the decker, If he so desires.
Use the host's base Security Value for its opposed Security
Test If the decker is inactive on the host for less than 10 seconds.
If the period of inactivity is less than a minute but more than 10
seconds, apply a +1 modifier to the Security Value. If the period
is less than an hour but more than a minute, apply a +2 modifi-
er. If the period is less than 12 hours but more than 1 hour. apply
a +4 modifier apply an additional + 1 modifier for every addi-
tional 12 hours. The gamemaster may set an upper limit on the
inactive period, depending on the decker's ability to avoid falling
asleep in the event of such implausibly long times.
Selena begins a download that will complete in 12 seconds. She
has nothing else she wants to do, so she waits. The gamemaster
requires a Null operation and adds +1 to the host's Security Value.
On a different run, Selena is waiting for a ground team to get
through a locked door (don't you just hate those manual doors with no
computer overrides on the lock?). The gamemaster determines that
the maglock penetration task will take 7 minutes. He also performs a
secret Null operation for Selena and applies a +2 modifier to the
host's Security Value for the opposed Security Test. The Security Test
yields several successes that push the security tally past its next trig-
ger step, which triggers a truly unpleasant IC program. The gamemas-
ter decides to have the IC show up 3 minutes into the waiting period.
If the Security Test raises the decker's security tally and trig-
gers a response from the host, the gamemaster should activate
the response as he sees fit, perhaps after a percentage interval of
the decker's period of inactivity.
REDIRECT DATATRAIL
Test: Control
Utility: Camo
Action: Complex
Deckers may perform Redirect Datatrail operations on any grid.
Reduce the target number for the opposing Security Test by the
decker's trace modifier (see Jackpoints, p. 28 in Grids and Hosts),
Deckers can leave only one redirect on a grid. For each grid
where a decker leaves a redirect, reduce his trace factor by I.
This reduction does not reduce the bandwidth modifier's effects
on the System Test for further Redirect Datatrail operations. See
Trace IC, p. 45. for more details.
RETRAIN
Test: Access
Utility: Commlink
Action: Free
The Retrain operation enables a decker to make his I/O
bandwidth wider or narrower. For the Access Test, use the
Access Rating of the system where the decker's icon is active.
The target number modifiers and effects on the Trace Factor are
determined by the decker's jackpoint (see Jackpoints, p. 28),
Deckers may perform Retrain operations and allocate more or
less I/O bandwidth at any time. even while loading data.
SCAN ICON
Test: Special
Utility: Scanner
Action: Simple
The Scan Icon operation enables a decker to gain informa-
tion about any decker, frame, or SK he has located.
The decker makes a Computer Test against the Masking
Rating of the targeted icon. If the targeted icon is running a
sleaze utility, subtract the utility's rating from the scanning deck-
er's scanner utility rating, Reduce the target number by the dif-
ference. If the sleaze program has a higher rating than the scan-
ner program, Increase the target number by the difference
between the sleaze and scanner ratings.
For each success the decker achieves on his Computer Test.
he may choose one of the following pieces of information:
· MPCP Rating of the icon
· Any Persona Rating of the icon
· Response Increase Rating of the icon
Identifying an icon requires an Analyze Icon operation
directed at the icon.
SWAP MEMORY
Test: None
Utility: None
Action: Simple
The Swap Memory operation enables a decker to load a new
utility program into his deck's active memory and then upload it
to his online icon
Loading the utility to active memory is a Simple Action -- the
decker simply tells the deck to do it. If his deck does not have
enough active memory or free icon bandwidth to hold the new
program, he must first spend a Free Action to unload a program
from his deck's active memory. No tests are required for these
actions, (New-generation cyberdecks have virtually unlimited
bus speeds between storage and active memory, so the Load
Speed Rating from the original SR Matrix rules does not apply.)

Orice the utility is in active memory, it automatically starts
uploading to the icon. See Ongoing Operations, p. 110. for
details on just when the utility will be available to the persona."
Squeezed or Compressed utilities must be decompressed
before they can be used, which requires a Complex Action ..
TAP COMCALL
Test: Special
Utility: Commlink
Action: Complex
The Tap Commcall operation enables deckers to locate
active commcodes on an LTG, trace and tap commcalls. Deckers
use the commlink utility for all the tests required during this
monitored operation.
To locate active commcodes on an LTG, a decker must be
active on an RTG that controls the LTG. The decker makes an
Index Test to determine if any commcodes on the LTG are send-
ing or receiving a call. If the decker finds a commcode in use, he
can make a Control Test to trace the call to its origin or destina-
tion. If multiple participants are making a conference call from
the commcode, each success on the test reveals the commcode
of one participant.
If the call was set up by another decker using the Make
Comcall operation, then the Control Test locates the decker con-
trolling the call. The decker trying to trace the call must move to
the calling decker's RTG and use a track utility against him. The
track utility locates all the other commcodes involved in the call.
If the decker wants to tap the call and record it in his deck's
storage memory or offline storage, he must make a Files Test.
Each minute of recording occupies 1 Mp of storage.
If the comm connection is scrambled, the decker must
decrypt it by making an unopposed Computer Test against the
tating of the Data Encryption System on the comm line. The
decrypt utility reduces the target number. The number of phones
and encryption devices involved in the call have no effect on the
decker's target number, If the first decryption test fails, the deck-
er can try again: apply a +2 modifier to the target number for
each additional test. None of the tests against scrambling affect
the decker's security tally on the RTG.
If any of the phones involved in the call is equipped with a
dataline scanner, the decker may set that off even if he doesn't
trigger an alert on the RTG. Dataline scanners (p. 243, SRII) have
a rating from 1 to 10. Once the decker establishes his tap, the
decker must make a Computer Test against the scanner's rating
[the commlink utility reduces this target number), If the decker
achieves a single success, he has synchronized the tiny fluctua-
tions in signal integrity caused by his tap and fooled the scanner.
If multiple dataline scanners are in use on the call, use the high-
est rating among them for the test. In this case. the decker needs
1 success for each scanner involved, of some of the devices
detect the tap (presumably the more expensive ones), Whether
this rest succeeds or fails, the result does not affect the decker's
security tally on the RTG.
Once a decker has tapped and unscrambled a call, he can
listen in and record, as he wishes. When the call terminates, he
can stay locked on to any of the commcodes, either the original
one that he was after or any that he traced. He can then attempt
to monitor any subsequent calls placed from the commcode. If
the decker is monitoring a code that he has already tapped, he
does not need to make Index Tests to determine when it
becomes active again. He does need to make new tests to trace
or tap the new calls and defeat any dataline scanners or encryp-
tion on the calls.
UPLOAD DATA
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Upload Data operation is an ongoing operation that
enables a decker to transmit data from his cyberdeck to the
Matrix. This data comes directly from the deck's storage memo-
ry and does not affect active memory. (For large uploads, see
Bandwidth. p. 90, for the rules governing upload times).
If the decker is creating a new file on the host, the file is writ-
ten automatically. If the decker intends to modify an existing file
on the host-adding false records to a database, for example-
the decker must perform an Edit File operation after the upload
is finished.
Note that the Upload Data operation is not used to upload
utilities. The Swap Memory operation handles that function,
VALIDATE PASSCODE
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex
The Validate Passcode operation enables a decker to plant a
fake passcode on a host. (Actually, "fake" is a misnomer, because
such passcodes are perfectly legitimate), Once logged on to a sys-
tem, the decker can start doing any of his usual operations. For
example, the decker can open accounts on mainframes where he
is stealing programming time, swiping resources from the corps
while he busily perfects the tools he will use against them.
The decker makes a Control Test to validate his passcode,
Apply a +2 modifier to the target number to validate a superuser
passcode and a +6 modifier to validate a supervisor passcode
(see Passcodes. p. 35, for further information).
After the decker makes the test, the gamemaster rolls ID6
and multiplies the result by the number of successes from the
rest. The result Is the number of days the passcode remains
effective, unless the decker does something to compromise it
first. Any time the decker uses the passcode on a run that raises
a host to active alert status, the host flags the passcode as ille-
gal. Once it recognizes a passcode as illegal, the host deletes it.

Deckers, IC, SKs (see Artificial Intelligences, p. 140), and frames can engage in
cybercombat. Icons representing system resources and applications cannot attack or
be attacked this way. Deckers may use system operations to engage these icons

CYBERCOMBAT SEQUENCE
Cybercombat in Matrix 2.0 follows much the same sequence
as standard SR combat. First, the opposing characters and icons
determine Initiative, then declare and resolve their actions,
Combat Turns in the Matrix are 3 seconds long, the same as
standard Shadowrun Combat Turns. (Though 3 seconds is an
endlessly long time in actual computer use. the 3-second turn
enables gamemasters to more easily synchronize Matrix actions
and physical actions elsewhere in the game.) Resolve any simul-
taneous actions in a Combat Phase in the following order: astral
actions, Matrix actions, and physical actions, with the following
exceptions
If a decker declares a Delayed Action (p. 80. SRII) to wait for
something to happen in the physical world, resolve his action
along with any physical actions of the Combat Phase. For exam-
ple, John has an action available on Combat Phase 10 of a turn.
He delays his action, waiting for his meat colleagues to get to a
security door. An IC program jumps John during Combat Phase
8. The IC program resolves its action along with other Matrix
actions during Combat Phase 8 John must wait to resolve his
action along with the physical actions of the phase. So think hard
about delaying, netheads-combat usually goes to the swiftest.
Deckers who are communicating directly by voice of
datascreen with the meatworld resolve their actions along with
the physical actions of a Combat Phase as well, even if they have
actions available before that time. This penalty does not apply to
communications via hitcher electrodes, with someone "along for
the ride" on the decker's own terminal, or to communications
with other personas on the system.
SUBJECTIVE TIME
Keep in mind that characters experience time subjectively in
the Matrix. The apparent time spent in moving through the
Matrix environment may be much longer than the actual game
time used to perform actions. For example, a decker who makes
a single Index Test as part of a system operation may experience
the test as a walk down a long hallway lined with books, which
ends when he finds the icon he wants. He may feel as if he has
spent several minutes or even hours searching for the item,
when actually only a few seconds of game time elapse.
INITIATIVE
Any icons with a Reaction attribute roll for Initiative per stan-
dard SR rules (p. 79, SRII).
DECHER INITIATIVE
The Initiative of a decker is based on the Reaction attribute of the
decker's persona. If his Reaction has no enhancements, the decker
rolls ID6 and adds the result to his Reaction to determine Initiative.
Reality filters, response-increase circuitry, and running on
hot decks by DNI all boost a decker's Initiative (see Cyberdecks.
p. 81, for additional information on these items).
Wired reflexes, magical augmentation, vehicle-control rigs.
and other enhancements that increase the Reaction attribute of a
decker's physical body do not affect Initiative in the Matrix.
Initiative and the Physical World
If a decker is engaged In direct communication with the
physical world via voice, print, datascreen, and so on, he loses
1D6 of Initiative until he drops the communications link. This
penalty does not apply to communications with a meathead via
hitcher electrodes, nor does it apply to users with tortoises.
IC INITIATIVE
When calculating the Initiative of an IC program, use the for-
mulas supplied in the IC Initiative Table. For IC constructs, use the
rating of the lowest-rated IC program in the construct. For IC pro-
grams arranged in a party cluster, determine Initiative separately
for each program.
If the Security Code of the host changes during the course of a
fight, the Initiative of IC programs on the host changes accordingly.
IC INITIATIVE TABLE
Host Security Code
Blue
Initiative
ID6 + IC Rating
Green
2D6 + IC Rating
Orange

Red
4D6 + IC Rating
OTHER PROGRAMS
Smart frames, SK's and other autonomous expert systems
have Reaction attributes equal to their Core Ratings (see Frames,
p. 104 and Artificial Intelligences. p. 138, for details), Roll 1D6
for Initiative for such systems unless they have response
enhancements.
When determining Initiative for any other programs,
assume they have Reaction attributes equal to their ratings and
roll ID6 for Initiative. For programs without ratings, use a flat
value of 6 as a Reaction attribute for the calculation.
ACTIONS
An icon may take one Free Action, and either two Simple
Actions or one Complex Action during a Combat Phase.
Besides the actions listed here, deckers may perform sys-
tem operations. These are listed in System Operations, p. 111.
and the System Operations Table, p. 161. Deckers must per-
form specific actions to execute each operation.
FREE ACTIONS
Free Actions are simple, almost automatic actions that
require hardly any effort to complete.

Delay Action
Deckers may delay actions per standard SRII rules (see pp.
80-81. SRII). See Cybercombat Sequence, p. 120, for rules on
resolving delayed actions.
Speak a Word
Standard SRII rules apply for verbal communications (see p.
81, SRII). Direct communications with characters in the physical
world affect the decker's Initiative as noted in Cybercombat
Sequence.
Deckers may also "buffer messages. When buffering a mes-
sage, the decker may write a message up to 100 words long and
give it to any character linked to the decker with hitcher elec-
trodes, radiolink, datascreen, or other device. The second char-
acter may also operate an icon the decker can "see."The second
character receives the buffered message at the end of the
Combat Turn.
Terminate Doumload/ Upload
A decker can suspend or terminate a data transmission at
any time.
Unload Program
The decker can remove a program from his deck's active
memory at any time, Removing a program releases active mem-
Dry and icon bandwidth for a Swap Memory operation.
Unsuppress IC
A decker can release IC from suppression and restore the
points being used to suppress the IC to his Detection Factor at
any time. If the suppression was keeping crashed IC from
Increasing the decker's security tally, the tally increases immedi-
ately. If the suppression was suspending the IC's actions, it
becomes active Immediately. (See Suppressing IC. p. 40 in
Intrusion Countermeasures, for further information.)
SIMPLE ACTIONS
A Simple Action requires a bit more concentration to per-
form than a Free Action, and may be slightly more complex.
Attack
A decker may attack an icon with any offensive utility
loaded in his deck. IC programs and other icons may attack
according to their programming.
Combat Maneuvers
Deckers and icons may engage in any listed combat maneu-
vers as a Simple Action (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121),
Improvise Attack
Deckers can use Simple Actions to create attack programs
"on the fly" (see Improvised Attacks. p. 123).
COMPLEX ACTIONS
Performing a Complex Action requires intense concentra-
tion on only that task.
Change Deck Mode
Changing mode (see Deck Modes, p. 74 in Deckers) is a
Complex Action.
non-COMBAT ACTIONS
For non-combat actions, deckers need not roll for Initiative
Instead, divide the decker's Reaction attribute by 10 (round up the
result). The result is the number of actions the decker may perform
during each 3-second game turn. Add I action for every Initiative
die the decker receives in combat beyond the standard. ID6.
During each available action the decker can perform one
Free Action, and either one Complex Action or two Simple
Actions. The decker can perform another Free Action in place of
either or both of the Simple Actions.
For example, a decker with 2 actions per turn could perform
a Logon to Host operation (a Complex Action) and a Retrain
operation on his I/O bandwidth (a Free Action) on his first action
phase. On the next action, he could perform an Analyze Host
operation (a Complex Action).
Reactive IC programs that perform tasks at the end of a
Combat Turn act after all deckers have performed their allotted
actions for a turn.
INITIATING COMBAT
A decker may initiate combat with any Icon that is "visible"
or any icon he has located. Any Icon that attacks a decker auto-
matically becomes visible, unless it successfully performs a com-
bat maneuver to conceal Itself (see Combat Maneuvers)
Deckers may locate reactive IC programs by performing the
appropriate Analyze operations, and they may locate other deck-
ers by performing Locate Decker operations (see System
Operations, p. 114). In addition, other deckers may make them-
selves visible to a decker by communicating with him, attacking
him, or deliberately revealing themselves in some other way.
Once a decker is "visible" or located, he remains so unless he
makes a successful combat maneuver to evade detection.
Proactive IC programs may initiate combat with any decker
whose security tally triggers the IC. The IC program can continue
to attack until the decker gets off the system or evades detection
with a combat maneuver,
COMBAT MANEUVERS
Deckers, proactive IC, smart frames, and any other self-
directed icons can perform combat maneuvers to avoid detec-
tion, parry attacks, or gain a position to make more accurate
attacks. All combat maneuvers are Simple Actions.

Each combat maneuver requires an opposed test between
the icon performing the maneuver and the icon opposing the
maneuver. The maneuvering icon makes an Evasion Test. If the
maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a
Security Test for the program, using the host's Security Value.
(Non-IC programs that lack Evasion attributes cannot perform
combat maneuvers.)
The opposing Icon makes a Sensor Test. If the maneuvering
icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for
the icon using the host's Security Value, (Non-IC programs that
lack Sensor attributes cannot oppose maneuvers actively.
However, if the maneuvering Icon achieves no successes on its
test, the maneuver still fails.)
If the maneuvering icon achieves more successes, note the
net successes-the number of successes that exceed the oppos-
ing test successes, The net successes determine how successful-
ly the icon maneuvered. If the opposing icon achieved an equal
or greater number of successes, the combat maneuver fails.
If the maneuvering icon has a cloak utility, reduce that icon's
target number by the Utility Rating. If the opposing icon has a
lock-on utility, reduce its target number by the Utility Rating.
EVADE DETECTION
An icon may perform an evade-detection maneuver to
evade an opposing icon that has detected it.
A decker must use the Analyze Icon operation to re-detect
an IC program that has evaded him with the maneuver. To re-
detect personas, frames, or SKs that have evaded him, a decker
must use a Locate Decker operation.
IC programs re-detect evading icons in a number of Combat
Turns equal to the net successes of the icon's Evasion Test. This
time is shortened by | turn for each point added to the icon's
security tally during the period, The IC program shows up at the
end of the last turn of the evasion period. ready for the Initiative
step in the next Combat Turn.
Deckers may use evade-detection maneuvers to evade trace
IC programs during the programs' hunting cycles. These pro-
grams cannot be evaded during their location cycles. Other
forms of reactive IC cannot be evaded at all.
Cybersushi is on an Orange-8 host when he comes under attack from
a killer IC program. He needs a breather to upload a more powerful
attack program, so he attempts an Evade IC operation.
First, Sushi makes his Evasion Test against the host's Security Value.
He has an Evasion attribute of 6, so he rolls 606. He also has a Cloak-4
utility, so the target number for the test is 4 (host Security Value - Cloak
Rating). Sushi achieves 3 successes. Meanwhile, the gamemaster
makes a Security Test for the host against Sushi's Evasion Rating. He
rolls 806 against a Target Number 6 and achieves 1 success.
That makes Sushi the winner of the test with 2 net successes. As a
result, he evades the killer IC program for 2 Combat Turns.
However, the host spots Cybersushi during the next turn as the deck-
er runs a Swap Memory operation. His security tally rises 2 points,
which wipes out his evasion period-the killer IC program re-detects
him at the end of the turn.
PARRY ATTACH
The parry-attack maneuver enables the maneuvering icon to
enhance Its defenses in cybercombar. If the maneuvering icon
wins the opposed test, increase target numbers for attacks
against the icon by its net successes on the test.
The bonus lasts until the next attack by the opposing icon. If
the opposing icon performs a position-attack maneuver, the
maneuvering icon retains the parry bonus. If either icon performs
an evade-detection maneuver, the bonus is lost.
POSITION ATTACK
The position-attack maneuver enables an icon to position
Itself for an attack on an opponent, This is a dangerous maneu-
ver that may backfire on an icon. If the maneuvering icon wins
the opposed test. the icon may reduce the target number for its
next attack by its net successes or Increase the Power of its attack
by the net successes. If the opposing icon wins the opposed test.
that Icon receives the bonus.
The bonus lasts only until the next attack,

Cybersushi has an Evasion attribute of 5 and is running a Cloak-2
utility when he runs into a corp decker with a Sensor attribute of 5 and
a Lock-On-3 utility. Sushi tries a position-attack maneuver to get the
jump on his opponent. He makes an Evasion Test against a Target
Number 3 (opposing icon's Sensor Rating - Sushi's Cloak Rating). His
opponent makes a Sensor Test against a Target Number 3 (Sushi's
Evasion Rating - opposing icon's Lock-On Rating). Sushi achieves 4
successes on his test, but his opponent achieves 5. As a result, the
corp decker may decrease the target number of his next attack against
Sushi by 1 or increase the Power of his attack by 1.
Sushi uses his remaining Simple Action in the phase to perform a
parry-attack maneuver. The tests are the same, but this time Sushi
wiss, with a net success of 1. That increases the target number of the
corp decker's attack by 1. The corp decker decides to accept the
increased target number and applies his position-attack bonus to the
Power of his attack.
RESOLVING ATTACHS
All cybercombat attacks are Simple Actions: To make an
attack, the attacker makes a test with his offensive utility pro-
gram. (Hacking F'ool dice may be used to augment the program.)
The target number for the test depends on two factors: the tar-
get icon's status -- Legitimate or Intruding-and the Security
Code of the host where the attack occurs. Any decker icon or IC
program that has logged onto a system with a valid passcode is
considered Legitimate. All other icons are Intruding. The
Cybercombat Target Numbers Table provides target numbers for
cons based on these factors
Apply any appropriate target-number modifiers from utility
options, maneuvers, damage, and so on.

An Intruding decker may attempt to alter his own target
number in the middle of a run by performing a Validate Passcode
operation to create a temporary Legitimate persona for himself.
This is an ad hoc combat trick-it does not stop IC programs and
other programs from attacking or affect System Tests, but it can
make the decker harder to hit. The host detects and deletes the
faked passcode as soon as the decker logs off.
Of course, a decker may log on using a Legitimate passcode
or a previously planted faked one. In general, if the decker uses
that passcode to get Legitimate status during a fight with the
host's own security programs, the host devalidates the passcode
when the decker jacks out or logs off. He has blown his cover, so
to speak. However, he can use the passcode in combat against
Intruding deckers without blowing his cover.
Record the number of successes scored on the Attack Test,
because they determine the effects of the attack. The various
types of offensive utilities have different effects on their targets.
Some reduce specific ratings of the targeted icon, while others
inflict damage on a decker's physical body. Any special effects
and opposed tests made by the targeted icon are noted in the
offensive utility descriptions (see Offensive Utilities, p. 98, in
Programs). For offensive utilities that do not inflict special dam-
age, see Icon Damage, below.
IMPROVISED ATTACHS
Under Matrix 2.0 rules, a decker can write an attack pro-
gram "on the fly" as a Simple Action. Such improvised attack
programs may be used for single attacks only-as one-shot util-
Ities, in other words.
The decker sets the attack program's Power by allocating
points from his Evasion and/or Bod ratings. Any combination of
points is allowed. However, the Power may not exceed the
MPCP Rating of the character's cyberdeck.
The decker's Evasion and/or Bod ratings remain reduced by
the number of points allocated to the attack program until he uses
the attack program. If he fails to complete the attack program suc-
cessfully, the ratings remain reduced until his next action.
To finish creating the attack program, the decker makes a
Computer Test against a target number equal to the program's
Power. On 1 success, the program has a Damage Level of Light:
on 2 successes, Moderate: on 3 successes, Serious: 4 or more
successes gives the program a Damage Level of Deadly.
ICON DAMAGE
Many offensive utility and IC programs, such as the hog and
reveal utilities and the poison and acid IC programs, inflict spe-
cialized forms of damage. Rules for resolving and resisting these
effects are provided in the entries for those programs (see
Programs, p. 94, and Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 38).
Other programs, such as attack and killer IC programs, inflict
damage per standard Shadowrun rules. Each of these programs
has a Damage Code, which consists of a numeric Power and a
Damage Level: Light, Moderate, Serious, or Deadly. The Power
for such programs is equal to their ratings.
The Damage Level for such IC programs is determined by
the host's Security Code, as shown on the IC Damage Table.

For every 2 successes on the attacker's Attack Test, stage up
by 1 level the Damage Level of the attack.
The Icon that has been hit rolls a Damage Resistance Test
using its Bod Rating against a target number equal to the Power
of the damage. For IC programs that take damage, make a
Damage Resistance Test using the host's Security Value, The
armor utility reduces the Power for the test, For every 2 success-
es on the test, stage down the Damage Level by 1 level.
Cassie is attacked by a Killer-6 program on an Orange host, so she
faces 65 damage. To make matters worse, the IC achieves 3 suc-
cesses on its Attack Test, so the damage stages up to 60.
Cassie is running an Armor-4 utility, which reduces the Power of
the attack to 2. Cassie makes a Bod (2) Test and achieves 4 success-
es. That stages the damage her persona takes down to Moderate.
CONDITION MONITORS
All Icons use a Condition Monitor. Each Condition Monitor
has 10 boxes, which are filled in as the icon takes damage per
the Condition Monitor Table, Once all 10 boxes are filled, the
icon crashes. If the icon is a persona, the persona's decker Is
dumped from the Matrix. The decker is vulnerable to dump
shock (see Dump Shock, below) and possibly other effects
(when black IC kills an Icon, It does not disconnect the decker-
It just makes it easier to fry his brain).

SIMSENSE OVERLOAD
Whenever a decker's icon takes damage from white or gray
IC. the decker's physical body may suffer Stun damage through
a resonance effect over the ASIST interface. This can only occur
on hor decks. Cool decks and tortoises are immune to this effect.
To determine whether the decker takes simsense overload
damage, he makes a Willpower Test against a target number
based on the damage taken by his icon. These target numbers
are provided in the Overload Damage Target Numbers table. If
the decker is running hot with a DNI-only interface, increase the
target number by 2. If the deck has an ICCM, reduce the target
number by 2. Any icon that takes Deadly damage crashes auto-
matically and exposes the decker to dump shock.
If the Willpower Test fails, the decker suffers a Light Stun
wound and fills in I box on his Mental Condition Monitor.
Simsense overload damage is not an issue when dealing
with black IC. Any damage the decker suffers in that case Is no
side effect!

DUMP SHOCK
When a decker is crashed off the Matrix or jacks out without
performing a Graceful Logoff operation, he risks Stun damage
from dump shock. The Power of the damage equals the host's
Security Value. This measures the shock of the sudden transition
from virtual to physical reality. The Damage Level is determined
by the host's Security Code, as shown on the Dump Shock
Damage Levels table.
If the decker was running a cool deck when dumped, reduce
the damage Power by 2 and lower the Damage Level by I level.
If the deck was equipped with an ICCM, reduce the Damage
Code in the same manner. These reductions are cumulative, so a
cool deck equipped with an ICCM provides a 4-point reduction
to the Power and lowers the Damage Level by 2 levels.
Tortoise users are Immune to dump shock.

Semi-autonomous knowbots, or SKs, are expert systems
with high-density, random-decision pathway capacities, SKs
have limited extrapolatory ability, and it has been posited that SK
architecture In a sufficiently powerful computing engine-an
ultraviolet level host-might achieve "critical mass" connectivity
In Its holographic neural network and become a true artificial
Intelligence. Whether the theory of critical mass connectivity Is
valid or not remains unknown, but rumors persist of functioning
Als-truly sentient beings born of and living in the Matrix.
SEMI-AUTONOMOUS KNOWBOTS
SK technology was pioneered by Renraku, but despite that
corporation's attempt to keep the algorithms "maximally propri-
etary" (I.e., top secret), SKs have been reported in use by such
megacorporations as Fuchi and Aztechnology, and by SSET in Tir
na nOg. SK programs are capable of self-directed data transport
on the Matrix. In other words, they can move. In effect, SKs are
mobile virtual machines, personas without cyberdecks,
So far, stable SK programs have been developed only under
the leadership of designers of genius. Developing these codes is
beyond the capabilities of canned algorithm generators and
comp-sci expert systems
In game terms, programming SKs requires the use of a Red-
10 or higher mainframe and programming resources equal to
half-a-dozen top programmers with Computer Skills of 12 or
higher. SKs must be custom-programmed for specific missions.
For example, a hunter-killer SK intended to assault a Fuchi data
fortress must be almost completely rewritten to go after an AZT
asset or assassinate a particularly irritating decker.
SKs should show up only rarely in Shadowrun games, Their
presence in an adventure represents a serious expenditure of
Matrix assets by a major power, As a result, SKs should be limit.
ed to major adventures or campaigns that involve powerful
megacorps or other equally potent organizations or individuals.
SHS AND NATIVE HOSTS
An SK is "born" within a native host-a system created by a
master program on a high-powered mainframe, The mainframe
must be of equal or greater processing power than the master
program, which is why corps don't scatter too many of these
around-they consume Immense amounts of machine time.
All SKs repair any damage to their Condition Monitors and
Persona Ratings by logging on to their native hosts. If an SK is dam-
aged while on its native host, It may receive the effects of a medic of
restore program at a rating equal to Its MPCP by spending a Complex
Action, Such repairs do not require points from the SK's Utility Pool
Naturally, SKs have passcodes for their native host systems,
The excessive demands on the mainframe of maintaining
the native host make SKs a cost-prohibitive way of maintaining
"unkillable" IC. However, most observers believe that ongoing
research will one day yield more efficient master programs that
will make such arrangements feasible.
SH RATINGS
The MPCP Rating of an SK equals ID6 + 6. The MPCP Rating
multiplied by 3 equals the maximum total of the SK's Bod
Evasion, Masking, and Sensor programs. No single Personā
Rating may exceed the MPCP Rating. All SKs have a Computer
Skill equal to their MPCP Ratings

SKs do not load utility programs, Instead, every SK has a
Utility Pool of points equal to its MPCP Rating + ID6. (See Utility
Pool, below, for rules on allocating Utility Pool points.}
The following represent a few typical SK configurations,
though the gamemaster may design SKs with any number of
Persona-Rating distributions because each is written for a specif-
ic mission:
MPCP-7/6/5/5/5
Computer Skill: 7
Pool: 8 to 13
MPCP-8/6/6/6/6
Computer Skill: 8
Pool: 9 to 17
MPCP-9/8/7/6/6
Computer Skill: 9
Pool: 10 to 15
MPCP-10/8/8/7/7
Computer Skill: 10
Pool: 11 to 16
MPCP-11/9/8/8/8
Computer Skill: 11
Pool: 12 to 17
MPCP-12/9/9/9/9
Computer Skill: 12
Pool: 13 to 18
UTILITY POOL
An SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool points to
any utility program for use as the need arises (assume that SKs
have access to all utilities at all times). Allocating points is a Free
Action:
An SK can mimic any operational utility program by using its
Utility Pool points. Each point from the pool acts as I Program
Rating Point. The maximum rating for any utility is equal to the
SK's MPCP Rating. Allocating Utility Pool points is a Free Action,
Almost all SK utilities work the same as standard utilities
with the following exceptions:
Black hammer and killjoy programs require 2 Utility Pool
points for each Program Rating Point. Any Utility Pool points allo-
cated to restore or medic programs cannot be re-allocated until
the SK returns to its native host and regenerates its code.
Finally, an SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool
points to the SK's Initiative Rating.
SH RESPONSE
An SK's base Reaction Rating equals its MPCP Rating, with
ID6 for Initiative. The SK's controlling player may increase the
SK's Initiative by allocating Utility Pool points: 1 point provides
2D6, 3 points provide 3D6, and 5 points provides 4D6-the
maximum increase allowed.
RUNNING AN SK
An SK has a specific mission objective, which may be sim-
ple or complex. Mission objectives may Involve single Matrix
runs or extended series of intrusions until the program locates its
ultimate objective. In the Matrix, SKs behave like fanatically ded-
icated deckers with no sense of personal survival. The SK may be
a combat monster, a cyberspy that depends on stealth-anything
that enables it to achieve its mission objective.
SKs are subject to damage and destruction just like any
other icons, When the SK's Condition Monitor is filled, the pro-
gram crashes and is gone. The programs have no fear of death,
of course, but their parameters make them evade or avoid com-
bat if it seems likely that they will crash before fulfilling their
objectives,
SKs cannot jack out when the going gets rough. They must
perform Graceful Logoff operations to leave hosts and Logon to
Host operations to access their native hosts and reach "safety."
However, SKs are typically programmed NOT to return to their
native hosts if doing so might create incriminating datatrails to
their creators
If an SK is destroyed on a mission, of course, its creators can
generate another one on the native host. Doing so is expensive, but
it costs less than paying off a corpdecker's life Insurance policy.
TRUE AI
True artificial intelligence (Al) programs are fully self-aware,
self-sustaining, immensely powerful Matrix programs.
Ultimately, every gamemaster must decide how many-if any-
Als he wants to introduce into his game. Generally. Als should
be incredibly rare. Nothing will take the mystery out of this new
life-form faster than having an Al turn out to be the "threat of the
week" every time the players turn around, If an Al is involved in
an adventure, the gamemaster should consider carefully why the
program is taking a hand in events, what it expects to get, and
how it will deal with any threats to its safety that might arise.
Indeed, In most cases an Al will go to great lengths to prevent
deckers from discovering its true identity,
Of course, the shadows have long been rife with rumors of
living programs, so an Al may decide its secret is safe-after all,
anything the player characters say may be discounted as just
another rant by some deckhead who's running his ASIST power
a little too hot. Of course, an entity that can transfer funds from
anywhere on the Matrix into credsticks and e-mail directives to
human hirelings can easily use more forceful means of silencing
troublesome Matrix runners.
The weakest form of newborn Al would be on a par with an
SK, but with self-regenerating ability-perhaps the power to cre-
ate a native host environment on any sufficiently powerful com-
puter. More powerful Als might possess the ability to weave
together wasted memory, dataspace, and distributed processing
power on scores of hosts into virtual "pocket universes" in cyber-
space-ultraviolet systems independent of any single host, sys-
tems that are everywhere and nowhere,
In addition to all the ratings that SKs possess, Als also have
Threat Ratings. The Threat Rating may be used as extra dice for
all the Al's tests, in the same manner as physical characters'
Threat Ratings. A typical newborn Al has a Threat Rating of 1;
more mature Als have Threat Ratings of 4 and up.
The main thing to remember when roleplaying Als is chat
these programs exist independently of human control. They are
not restricted to any single mainframe. They are self-aware, self-
directing, self-sustaining life-forms. In effect. they are superhu-
man deckers with superhuman Matrix powers, unburdened by
physical bodies. Of course, Als are not human, and their con-
sciousness and motivations may just be their most mysterious,
Incomprehensible aspects.

Consider the otaku, the so-called children of the
Fast coming int
Inheritance,
the oldest kne
otaku are in their late teens today. And their numbers keep growing some
otaku reportedly go under the laser for their first Jack as young as seven or eight. No one knows
for certain. however, how many otaku exist of their true Influence on the Matrix. In fact. many
observers deny the existence of the otaku altogether. Despite the lack of statistically significant
evidence, rumors that these mysterious individuals ply their remarkable skills in the net refuse
to die out of the decker community.

The role of the otaku in his Shadowrun game is entirely up
to the gamemaster. He may choose to leave them offstage-
almost legends, like those presented in Denver, The City of
Shadows, with powers and limitations unknown to the players,
Or the gamemaster may use the model presented here, but limit
the otaku to non-player-character roles. Or the gamemaster may
allow players to create otaku characters.
BECOMING OTAKU
Some experts claim that several otaku communities exist,
each with its own distinctive subculture. However, all share certain
behavior patterns. First, the otaku communities seem to select
new members according to a highly intuitive process. In most
cases, it seems that established community members bring in
recruits from the streets, prompted to do so by some inner voice.
Many otaku recruits spend their earliest years scrabbling for
basic survival in the worst barrens of Seattle, Denver, and
DeeCee. Some rumors tell of children as young as two or three
found on the doorstep of otaku communities. Once a child is
accepted into an otaku community, he undergoes a probationary
period. During this time, he begins to learn the ways of the
Matrix. Candidates begin hands-on Matrix runs almost at once.
They start with tortoises, then move up to 'trode connections to
live decks. After an unspecified period of time, a recruit either
leaves the otaku community or accepts a datajack implant and
begins running on hot decks. By this time, most otaku are the
equals of veteran deckers.
Many candidates stop at this point, leave the community
and go on to become novahot deckers, programmers, and deck-
meisters. Others-those who show the deepest, most profound-
ly Imprinted understanding of the Matrix-undergo an experi-
ence which changes them forever. Those who experience the so-
called Deep Resonance become capable of interacting with
cyberspace using only an implanted digital/neurological ASIST
converter and their bare brains. These otaku are known among
deckers as technoshamans and cyberadepts.
THE DEEP RESONANCE
Otaku who experience the Deep Resonance are capable of
running the Matrix without cyberdecks. Apparently, the Deep
Resonance transforms the individual, just as an awakening of mag-
ical power transforms a latent shaman. In fact, some alleged otaku
who have spoken of this event use terms reminiscent of the totemic
experience of the shaman. Others speak of suddenly perceiving
interlocking energies and formulae, in the manner of a mage.
Both sets of experiences seem to indicate that the otaku forms
a virtually mystical relationship with the Matrix and begins to view
the nets as a living entity. Whatever the reality behind the Deep
Resonance experience may be. It appears to cause permanent neu-
rological change in the otaku that permits "decking"without a
deck. The neural interface of the otaku's implanted datajack begins
to interact with the redundant holographic capacity of the brain as
If it were a bioprocess computer-which, of course, it is,
BUILDING AN OTAKU
Otaku may be of any race. Human otaku must assign Priority
A to Resources, Metahuman otaku must assign Priority B to
Resources, or A if their gamemaster allows the More
Metahumans option (p. 46, SRII).
The otaku character does not receive the usual benefits of
Priority A or B Resources. See Allocating Resources, p. 145,
Magic is Priority E for otaku. There is no known instance of
a magically active otaku. Human otaku assign Priority D to Race,
and must allocate Skills and Attributes berween Priorities B and
C. Metahuman otaku in a standard game must allocate Skills and
Attributes between Priorities C and D.
ALLOCATING ATTRIBUTES
The racial maximums for otaku characters' Mental Attributes
are raised by 1. Reduce racial maximums for Physical Attributes
by 1. These modifications reflect potentials that seem to be
inherent in the children chosen to be otaku.
If a player allocates only | point each to all of the character's
Physical Attributes and halves his racial maximums in those
attributes (round fractions up), he receives 2 extra Attribute
Points to allocate to his Mental Attributes any way he wishes
Also in this case, increase the racial maximums for the charac-
ter's Mental Attributes by a total of 2 rather than 1. This repre-
sents a common pattern among many otaku, whose subnormal
physical development, even disabilities, are coupled with
extremely high IQs and determination
ALLOCATING SHILLS
An otaku must allocate at least 6 and no more than 8 points
to his starting Computer Skill. He may concentrate in Software or
specialize in Decking.
Any Channel skill (see Channels, below) may have a begin-
ning Rating of 6. One other Channel skill may have a Rating 5.
and a third Channel skill may have a Rating 4. The beginning rat-
ings of all remaining Channel skills may not exceed 3.
The only Etiquette skills the otaku may possess when he
enters the game are Matrix and Street.
All these restrictions apply only when creating an otaku
character. Players are free to improve skills during the game to
make the otaku more well-rounded. Remember that most otaku
at the beginning of their careers, are a weird mix of nearly autis
tic street kid and sophisticated techhead-with extremely limit-
ed life experiences. These rules are designed to simulate that
profile.
Channels
Otaku learn five special skills that act as operational utilities
when the otaku perform System Tests. These skills, called chan-
nels, are named for the five subsystems of Matrix computers
Access, Control, Index, Files, and Slave. Whenever an otaku
makes a required Subsystem Test during a system operation, he
uses the appropriate channel to lower the test target number. For

example. an Analyze Security operation requires a Control Test.
A normal decker could lower the target number for the test with
an analyze utility. An otaku with Control Channel would use the
Control Channel Rating instead.
When creating an otaku character, a player receives a num-
ber of points equal to the average of his Mental Attributes
i[Intelligence - Will + Charisma] + 3. round up). He can distrib
ute these points among his channels as he wishes. Regular skill
points can also be used to increase the channel ratings.
Once the otaku character is in the game, the channels can
be Improved like any other skills, using Karma Points.
The basic channels are general skills. Concentrations that
mimic the action of each specific utility exist as well. For exam-
ple, Control Channel (Analyze) would only be effective when
making Control Tests for System Operations that normally
require ant analyze utility, such as Analyze Host and Analyze IC
operations. Specializations for the otaku channels are limited to
a single operation-Files Channel (Edit File), for example.
ALLOCATING RESOURCES
The high Resource priority for otaku Is dedicated to their skill
benefits, their background, and the toll exacted by the Deep
Resonance experience. Therefore, an otaku character receives
only 5,000 nuyen for additional outfitting, as if his Resources
were Priority D.
PROGRAMMING DAYS
Every otaku receives an allotment of days that he may
spend programming utilities according to the rules for Complex
Forms, below. The allotment equals the character's Computer
Skill multiplied by 3. In addition, he receives the standard oraku
task bonus: (Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) + 4.
The player can allocate these days any way he likes. Any
programs in progress at the start of play can be finished during
the game, as with any incomplete task.
LIVING PERSONA
The Deep Resonance creates the otaku's icon-his living
persona-based on the character's Mental characteristics. The
appearance of the living persona usually follows the customs of
the otaku community where the character was raised.
MPCP: (Intelligence Rating + Willpower Rating + Charisma
Rating) + 3 (round up)
Bod: Willpower Rating
Evasion: Intelligence Rating
Masking: (Willpower Rating + Charisma Rating) = 2 (round up)
Sensor: Intelligence Rating
Response: (Intelligence Rating +Willpower Rating) + 2 (round
up) - 3D6 Initiative
Armor: Willpower Rating
Hardening: Willpower Rating + 2, round up
I/O Speed: Intelligence Rating × 100 Mp
ENHANCED ATTRIBUTES
Cyberware that Improves an otaku's Mental Attribute adds
its effect directly to the living persona's ratings. For example, an
otaku who receives a Cerebral Booster-2 implant would modify
his living persona's ratings to reflect his increased Intelligence
Rating
Improvements to the Mental Attributes bought with Karma
Points raise the living persona's ratings as well.
The aspects of Charisma that operate in the living persona
are self-image and self-confidence. Cosmetic aspects are trivial in
this regard. Therefore, any purely cosmetic enhancements to an
otaku's Charisma Rating, or those aimed at enhancing Social
Skills, do not affect the living persona ratings. For example, tal-
lored pheromones (p. 18, Shadowtech), do not increase an
otaku's living persona ratings.
For reasons yet unknown, magical enhancements do not
affect the living persona. They affect only the otaku's actions in
the physical world.
RESPONSE
An otaku's Reaction Rating in the Matrix is equal to the
average of his Intelligence and Willpower ratings, He receives
3Do for Matrix Initiative.
ARMOR/HARDENING
The living persona's online Armor and Hardening ratings
against gray or black IC are based on the otaku's Willpower Rating.
Both can be raised by creating the appropriate Complex Forms.
COMPLEX FORMS
In addition to the five channels, otaku can "program" versions
of other operational utilities for their own use. The otaku call such.
utilities complex forms. In reality, the otaku does not actually
"program" a complex form-he alters the holographic nerve com-
plexes of his own brain to produce the effects of the program.
In game terms, however, an otaku creating a complex form
follows a five-step process. The steps are: selecting the complex
form rating, paying necessary Karma Points, determining the
complex form size, calculating the base time for carrying out the
task, and then performing the task.
The rating of a complex form may not exceed the otaku's
Computer Skill or an appropriate concentration or specialization
of that skill. After selecting the complex-form rating, the otaku
must pay a number of Karma Points equal to the rating
Next, determine the size of the complex form. The size is
calculated in the same manner as a program size, using the fol-
lowing formula:
(Complex form rating2 x utility multiplier) + (option rating2
+ option multiplier) - size in Mp
The utility multiplier is the multiplier of the operational utility the
complex form mimics. Otaku may also Include options with a
complex form, as indicated in the formula. However, options

such as optimization, squeeze, and other space-savers are nei-
ther required nor allowed with complex forms. Remember, the
complex form is not stored on a deck-it's stored in the otaku's
brain. The complex form size is used only to determine the base
time for creating the complex form, not for storage or uploading.
After determining the complex form size, calculate the base
time for the task, using the following formula:
Complex form size x 2 - base time in days
The otaku may reduce the base time by using his otaku task
bonus:
(Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) divided by 4 (round
up) - otaku task bonus
The otaku task bonus effectively reduces the number of days
needed to complete the task, just like a standard task bonus (see
Task Bonuses, p. 77 in Deckers, for an explanation of task
bonuses). In addition, an otaku may add I point to his task bonus
by spending a number of Karma Points equal to the complex
form rating. For example, an otaku creating a Rating 7 complex
form could spend 7 Karma Points to increase his task bonus by 1
point. The same otaku could spend 14 Karma Points to Increase
his task bonus by 2 points, and so on. After applying all task
bonuses to the base time, the otaku spends any of his allotted
programming days to perform the task of "programming" the
complex form into his brain.
The base time for upgrading a complex form is calculated in
the same manner as base times for upgrades of standard pro-
grams (see Upgrades, p. 107 in Programs), When upgrading a
complex form. the original version of the program keeps work-
ing normally until the programming task is completed. At that
time, the form's new rating or features kick in. When upgrading
a form, the otaku must spend a number of Karma Points equal to
the final rating of the upgraded form.
The otaku cannot upgrade his persona or MPCP ratings as
complex forms, because these features are pegged directly to
his Mental Attributes. However, an otaku can upgrade his Armor
and Hardening ratings. The otaku must upgrade based on his
Inherent ratings, For example, if an otaku has Willpower-6, he
has Armor-6 automatically. To upgrade his armor as a complex
form, the otaku must upgrade it to 7 or higher.
SPRITES
The otaku call program frames sprites, and reputedly make
wide use of them. An otaku creates frame cores per standard
rules (see Frames, p. 105 in Programs), Otaku may not use frame
cores created by another individual. Each otaku must create his
own. Additionally, the otaku must spend a number of Karma
Points equal to the frame Core Rating,
After completing a frame core, the otaku can load it with
any complex form he possesses, as well as operational utilities.
The rating of a complex form on the sprite may not exceed the
otaku's own rating in that form. Similarly, the rating of any oper-
ational utility loaded onto the sprite may not exceed the otaku's
rating In the corresponding channel. When loading operational
utilities, the otaku follows the standard rules for loading a frame
(see Frames. p. 105, in Programs).
At this point, the otaku has the option of spending a num-
ber of Karma Points equal to the sprite's complex form and util-
ity ratings to strengthen the sprite. If the otaku does so, the
sprite becomes temporarily disabled if it crashes. The sprite
remains intact and becomes available again as soon as the otaku
jacks out of the system. If the otaku does not spend these Karma
Points, the sprite is permanently wiped clean if it crashes. The
frame core survives intact, but all complex forms and utilities
must be reloaded.
OTAKU AND THE SOTA
The Deep Resonance experience enables otaku to continu-
ously adapt to changes in the Matrix (some otaku claim that the
Deep Resonance itself causes all change in the Matrix).
Therefore, otaku are always in synch with the SOTA and do not
have to take any action when it advances.
OTAKU AND DAMAGE
The intimate link between the otaku and his living persona
created by the Deep Resonance experience also makes otaku
more vulnerable to damage than standard deckers.
Any damage to an otaku's icon condition monitor also does
damage to the otaku's Mental Condition Monitor, Black IC pro-
grams attack the otaku's Physical Condition Monitor, just as black
IC does against normal deckers:
Gray IC is especially dangerous to otaku. If the living per-
sona suffers permanent damage to a Persona Rating, the rating
remains reduced until the otaku can upgrade it back to Its origi-
nal level-this is the one exception to the rule that otaku can't
program their Persona Ratings. On the other hand, this pro-
gramming task does not require Karma Points, only time.
Damage to a complex form caused by tar IC or hog pro-
grams puts the form out of action until the otaku can jack out.
Complex forms regenerate from such damage at a rate of 1 point
per hour, but do not recover at all if the otaku is suffering from
damage to either his Mental or Physical Condition Monitor, The
otaku must heal Condition Monitor damage before his complex
forms regenerate.
On the upside, an otaku's channels are not vulnerable to tar
IC and hog programs. An otaku can use his control channel all he
likes in the presence of tar baby, and the IC will not react to it.
Additionally, otaku are immune to actual virus codes, such
as worm programs.
PLAYING AN OTAKU
You don't know who birthed you, whether they dumped
you or died on you. Didn't make much difference back there.
Cold and hunger were your heritage, scrounging half-spoiled
stuffers out of trash dumps, hiding from the bigger kids who'd

take them away. From time to time, the word flashed through
your tiny world that the hunters were out, and with the stink of
your fear cutting sharp even through your normal reek, you went
to ground until they were gone. Now you know who they might
have been. The list is long: sweepers for the kiddy shops, organ-
leggers looking for easily Implanted young tissue, "sporting"
folks hunting prey that could run and think and maybe beg for
merey. But there wasn't any mercy back there. Not for anyone.
You survived somehow, Then one day you found a handful
of older kids around your hidey-place. They didn't look like the
kids you knew. Now you know the difference between malnutri-
tion and health, between clean clothes and dirty rags. Back there.
you just knew they looked different. And they talked to you and
brought you here.
They showed you new things and gave you words for them,
They taught you numbers, and what the numbers did. They
taught you a new thing you liked almost better than anything.
You learned it was called friendship.
They gave you your first datajack and showed you how to
use it. Then you discovered the Deep Resonance and began to
learn the channels, the complex forms. the ways of your new-
found home-the Matrix:
Playing an otaku means that your character, in all likelihood,
spent his earliest years as an abandoned child in an environment
of extreme poverty-surviving by begging, theft and scroung-
ing, and subject to the predations of some of the worst walking
garbage in the Sixth World. Older otaku recognized the poten-
tial to become an otaku in your character and rescued him from
this life. They gave him food, shelter, education, and a sense of
community-the first he ever experienced.
Outside the tribal structure of his otaku community, your
character may be significantly socially handicapped, wholly defi-
cient in social skills, Of course, mental stability has to rank high
in the things otaku look for in new members, or they'd all be
crazy as bedbugs after such severe childhood trauma. But you
aren't going to find an otaku who comes across like a cute kid
from a sitcom, either. Don't expect non-otaku to like your char-
acter too much; they're going to think he's weird and they'll
probably make tracks to avoid him whenever possible.
At their best, young otaku are often rude and anti-social,
even by shadowrunner standards. They are arrogant in anything
Involving the Matrix and more than half convinced that nothing
outside the Matrix matters a frag unless it affects their personal
comfort or security. The well-being of fellow otaku in their own
community is important to them. The well-being of other otaku
comes next. Personal friends, if they have any, third, and the rest
of the world a very distant fourth. These priorities may manifest
themselves as Intensely brattish behavior or as cold-blooded
ruthlessness without a trace of what the shrinks call "affect."
Certainly, otaku can grow into more well-rounded human
beings, given friendship. responsibility, even trust, within the
shadow code. But no one is likely to enjoy the company of an
otaku while he matures.
CYBERADEPT OR TECHNOSHAMAN?
Otaku fall into two broad groups: the cyberadepts and the
technoshamans. Both groups exhibit identical abilities, but they
hold different views of the Deep Resonance and their own places
In the world.
Cyberadepts are rationalists, technophiles-perhaps psy-
chologically more attuned to the specific workings of programs
and the organization of data than other otaku. They view their
state as a natural and Inevitable blending of humanity and tech-
nology and tend to express their concepts in precise terms,
almost formulae.
Technoshamans see the Matrix as a living being, which they
have learned to blend with spiritually. They are more mystical,
more holistic in their descriptions of computer operations and per-
formance than other otaku. Many technoshamans maintain that
the Deep Resonance proceeds from spirits resident in the Matrix.
If the gamemaster wants to play up these differences in his
games, he may apply the following cyberadept and tech-
noshaman bonuses:
Cyberadepts apply a +1 modifier to the effective rating of
any complex form they learn. They must create the form before
getting this bonus, but it does not affect the size of the form. This
bonus reflects the cyberadepts' particular insight into the details
of Matrix operations.
Technoshamans reduce target numbers by 1 when using
their channels, This bonus reflects their approach to the Matrix as
a gestalt with which they blend.
Players choosing one or the other of these orientations
should roleplay their character accordingly.
MYSTERY OF THE OTAKU
Even the otaku don't know why they experience the Deep
Resonance. The technoshamans of the Denver Nexus claim that
the work of Shiva and the other sysops who maintain the Nexus
has somehow created a cyberspace where they, the true children
of the Matrix, see deeper into its truths than the old-tech
dinosaurs. Some of them believe that true Spirits of the Matrix
exist in this environment. Others claim the Deep Resonance is an
actual evolutionary step, and that cyberadepts are the next step
in the long march from the first hominids.
Among non-otaku. even wilder theories abound. Some
older elves agree with the technoshamans that a Great Spirit has
learned to manifest in the Matrix, native to the Matrix the way
other nature spirits are native to their domains. A very experi-
enced decker in Seattle advanced the theory, before he disap-
peared, that the Virus of 2029 had evolved Into a cybernetic life-
form, as homo sapiens evolved from the primal goo of Earth's
earliest seas, and that it was helping the children of the Matrix
evolve into a form similar to its own. A top-secret report to the
board of Aztechnology suggests the existence of a super-Al
somewhere in cyberspace, which is now functioning indepen-
dently and using the otaku as its agents. Hard to say what else

the author thought. She committed suicide a few days after sub-
mitting the final draft of her report, which her superiors dis-
missed as the work of an unbalanced mind. A reporter in Berlin
left partial notes suggesting that aliens from outer space were
taking up residence in the Matrix and grooming earth children as
a conquering army of netsoldiers. His editors considered running
the story after the traffic accident. but couldn't find the rest of his
files, so they spiked it instead.
Given this track record, other folks with theories about the
technoshamans and cyberadepts may be playing it smart by
keeping quiet.
Regardless of these differing explanations, the experience of
the Deep Resonance follows certain patterns. Technoshamans
report a sudden transport to a place unlike any in their Matrix or
physical experience. Here they encounter a being, or beings.
who give them the seed knowledge that grows into their ability
in the Matrix. Cyberadepts, on the other hand, claim that they
know they are still in the Matrix, but perceive connections and
networks of dataflow that transcend the interface of the deck.
Both emerge from the experience with the abilities described in
this text. Sometimes they enter these states again, and when
they return they have gained new abilities or received a mission
which they must carry out.
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?
Good question. Those who may know are not saying.
Sometimes otaku undertake specific missions, which they claim
-come from the Deep Resonance. These missions can be trivial or
major. Trivial missions include ensuring the delivery of programs
to specific places at specific times, the kind of low-level gigs that
secure courier services usually handle. Major missions have
Involved preventing certain corporations from achieving specific
goals: neutralizing, or killing magicians Involved in certain
research or cooking the research files to sabotage the projects:
and preventing (or ensuring) certain deaths-either apparent
accidents or deliberate assassinations.
Often, otaku on a mission seem devoid of anything a human
would recognize as compassion. But in the main, otaku missions
turn out to be for the benefit of liberty and of humanity at large.
once the patterns become discernible-as if they were dictated
by some source that perceives the interplay of seemingly unre-
lated, even trivial, events in the world community bound togeth-
er by the Matrix. The real Ghost in the Machine? Or children
playing at deity with powers that their elders cannot control?
Despite the information on the otaku that exists, far more
remains unknown about these individuals. If some type of guiding
force exists behind the otaku, why has it chosen an army of chil-
dren with virtually no experience of life outside the Matrix? And
why the different experiences of the technoshamans and cyber-
adepts? What could cause changes in the human neural net that
2 1st-century geneticists cannot understand, let alone replicate?
Perhaps future explorers of that strange universe called the
Matrix may one day find answers to such questions.

we've got a great deal on resort homesteads in the Jersey Toxic
Zone for you. Ares engineers its systems for maximum dataflow
overview. Transaction packets and data streams transmitted
between individual hosts in a local net must pass through heav-
ily loaded chokepoints. The working mainframes themselves are
relatively IC-free, which promotes maximum efficiency, while
the chokepoints provide the focal point for Ares data security ..
The Regional Sales complex shown here is a tiered system
that opens onto the public grid through Host A, an open-access
Green system where Ares displays promotional sims and non-
classified product data files to clients. Hidden behind the
salesroom is the chokepoint labeled Host B. This guards the
more sensitive systems but doesn't carry any paydata itself. Host
B is the hub for Hosts CI through C4: Accounting. Tech Support,
Sales Management and Maintenance, respectively. Both CI and
C2 provide gateways to the area-PLTG backbone. Hosts C1
through C3 provide some useful paydata.
C4. the Maintenance area, includes most of the slave nodes a
team would need on a ground insertion into the office building.
The real hot stuff-exec data files, secure e-mail and the security
slave nodes-take up space on Host D, networked to C4.
Other valuable Ares hosts may be located and accessed
through the PLTG.
Host A Green=5/8/10/8/10/10
Paydata: 0
Host A is designed as a standard office/salesroom
metaphor mixed with UMS iconography, so pedestrian it does-
n't count as sculpture. Any reality filter will automatically domi-
nate Host A. Deckers searching for paydata find only some
entertaining sims (the military hardware ones are terrific) and
catalog entries for Ares products of all kinds.
Viewing sales files and promos does not require an opera-
tion or affect the security tally. Any decker with a credstick to
slot, drawing on a legit account or a certified balance, can order
any Ares product through this host, just like a customer who
logged on legally. Getting an order accepted without paying
would require a run into Host CI to insert a false payment record
into the Accounting database.
The Access subsystem contains a dedicated port to Host B.
A successful Analyze Access operation will reveal the address.

The C systems all have identical software, including the IC,
but the sculpture on each one is different. Passive IC on a C host,
including Trace, will shut down when a decker logs off that host.
Active IC will pursue the decker to another part of the C network
and onto Host B. Security tallies remain in effect on any C host.
For example, if a decker accumulates a Security Tally of 4 on CI,
logs back onto Host B, and later in the same run logs back onto
CI. his tally picks up at 4.
The sculpture on CI is standard office decor at first blush, but
the helpful secretarial icons are all tuned up to cutting-edge, male
fashion model dress and good looks. The supervisory programs
are all female. It's heavily seated sculpture, subtle but solld. A
decker would be well advised to load a top-line, fem-exec look if
he decides to "dress" his MPCP for a run into this system.
The CI metaphor dates from when Regina O'Meara edged
out Ted Harcourt as the local head of accounting. Harcourt had
mandated pornsim queens as the main iconography for the serv-
er programs when he was in charge. Modesty prevents us from
describing the way they'd acknowledge a successful access, but
some deckers used to log-on and open absolutely worthless files
just for the experience.
The metaphor on C2 is an old-style amusement park, The
roller coaster is the Index access to all the low-security files.
Deckers swoop and scream until they reach the right datastore.
then the car JUMPS off the tracks and salls through the air Into
the file area.
The high-security spec files follow a fun-house motif.
The gateways to the PLTG are in the Access subsystems on
both CI and C2. Scramble IC protects both SANs. so a decker
needs to perform a successful Decrypt operation in order to log-
on to the PLTG.
C3 uses a standard office motif, though it does count as a
sculpted system,
Techno-flash control panels showing readouts on the build-
ing environmentals, the elevators and plumbing fill C4-every-
thing's here except security sensors and alarms, which are resi-
dent on Host D. The client servers use well-sculpted custom
iconography consisting of shiny robots with goofy smiles pasted
on their faces. The rest is mostly UMS iconography. The trap door
to Host D rotates randomly through all the subsystems nanosec-
ond by nanosecond, and so a decker must search for it every
time he needs to find it.

This one's the treasure chest. In addition to the basic pay-
data, the type of secure data that shadowrunners typically need
in an adventure are stored on Host D. The host also contains the
SAN into the Federal PLTG.

Files such as crime reports implicating shadowrunners are stored
here, but if they have been online more than a few hours, they will
also have been distributed to high-security databanks (Red-Hard sys-
tems) through the PLTG. Erasing or modifying such records would
involve an extremely dangerous run through the government grid,
The Access subsystem is protected by Scramble IC; until the
decker decrypts it, his persona cannot log on to the host. All secure
datafiles are protected by Scramble IC, data bombs, or worms,

About Government Deckers
The following guidelines for government deckers also apply
to corp deckers, or any decker retained to defend a system. The
gamemaster may design an NPC decker of his own, but may use
the following rules if he needs a quick-and-dirty decker character.
Government deckers may be defined as Inferior, Equal, or
Superior opponents. An Inferior opponent has an MPCP Rating 2
points below that of the player-character decker. A Superior oppo-
nent has an MPCP Rating 2 points higher. An Equal opponent has
an MPCP Rating-and everything else-equal to the player-char-
acter decker's. Similarly, an Inferior opponent has a Response
Increase 1 point lower than the player-character decker's, and a
Superior opponent's Response Increase is one point higher.
Persona programs for all government deckers are at their
maximum. As a decker's total Persona Ratings cannot exceed 3
x MPCP and four programs make up a standard persona, the rat-
ing for each persona program ends up being three-fourths of the
MPCP. rounded down. Government and corp deckers running
without a Masking program have ratings equal to the MPCP for
each persona program.
All utilities are at maximum value-equal to the MPCP rat-
ing. Inferior opponents should rarely. If ever, have utilities with
options. Superior opponents should have programs with a little
something special, at the gamemaster's discretion. An Equal
opponent's utilities depend on the player-character decker-if
the player character is loaded for bear, so is his opponent.
These NPCs usually carry Armor, Attack. Cloak, and Lock-
On. They may also carry one or more utilities that attack Persona
Ratings, especially if their job includes "softening up" the intrud-
er for attacks by IC. Inferior opponents carry no self-repair pro-
grams. Superior opponents carry Medic and Restore. Equal
opponents match the player-character decker's capabilities.
On systems where deadly force might reasonably be
expected, any NPC decker may be armed with black hammer or
killjoy. Government deckers are especially likely to carry track
programs, as part of their department's job is to enforce Matrix
law in the real world as well as on the grid.
These deckers use Legitimate icons on the hosts they
defend, and so IC will not attack them. To attack these oppo-
nents, the intruding decker must use the appropriate target num-
ber to hit Legitimate Icons (see Cybercombat, p. 123),

HOST DESIGN TABLES
To design a typical host, select the desired Security Rating and Intrusion Difficulty, then make the appropriate dice rolls to deter-
mine the Security Value and Subsystem Ratings. The Paydata Allocation Table provides formulas for determining Paydata Points and data
density of the host, Density may be rolled in advance or when the decker locates the paydata and Is ready to download it.

Next, design the security sheaf. First, roll ID6 + 2 and apply
the appropriate modifier to produce the first trigger step. Then
repeat the dice roll and add the modified result to the first step.
The result is the second trigger step. Repeat the process to
determine the remaining trigger steps.
