IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN
It's hard to believe that a year has already gone by since we posted the last State of the Art
folio. We've seen a lot happen with various dragon maneuverings, corporate infighting, the
founding of the NEEC, a brewing mob war in Europe, and the continuation of civil warfare in
Poland and the Philippines. The screamsheets have not been lacking for newsworthy material-
which means that our line of biz is doing just fine.
But let's not get cocky. With the changes our world goes through every day, it's becoming
an increasing challenge to keep up with the latest developments. If you don't suspect that an
adept might try running across water to sneak up behind you or that a spook might have a taser
concealed in that hollowed-out credstick, then you're not doing your job. We all know that stay-
ing alive means keeping ahead of the game, being prepared so that we can laugh at our oppo-
nent's "big surprise" and tell him that was last week's vaporware.
Once again, as roll over our calendars to the big '64, I present you with a file collection that
compiles some of the latest advances that you should be watching out for. some intel on the cut-
ting edge. Just like last year, I've focused on five areas of particular interest to shadowrunners. This
time, I've chosen to feature modern espionage, adept paths and magic, police operations,
European magic traditions and the perennial favorite, that slop that passes as "culture" these days.
The spy game material is a friendly reminder that nation states still play in our sandbox just as
much as corporate agents do. The material on adepts is a bit overdue, as there are many types of
adepts out there who haven't gotten the recognition they deserve, and they have plenty of nifty new
powers up their sleeves. The material on cops just seems a necessity, as they are the number one
opposition shadowrunners need to keep an eye out for, so we should all know what they're up to. The
exploration of Euro magic is an add-on to the Shadows of Europe folio we recently posted, since so
many of you have had run-ins with magicians who didn't fit the North American norms. And finally,
the culture section should give you some ideas on where to look for work, as well give you a heads-
up on world events in case you've had your head buried in a Matrix game node for the past year.
Remember kids, it's not just enough to scan this information-it's how you use it that counts.
There are plenty of items here that can save your hoop in the right situation, and plenty of facts
that can lead to you cashing in on a sweet run. So quit slacking and get to work.

ou know the cliché: information is the only valuable commodity in the world. As annoying
as it sounds, it's true, especially for us in the shadows. We'd be out of a job were it not for
people trying to find out things they're not supposed to know.
No one knows this better than intelligence agencies around the world. They were plying
the trade of info-hoarding long before the megacorps even knew the meaning of "propri-
etary information." And because one wrong move can spark a war no one really wants, the
spooks have learned how to be real quiet about it.
I put out a call for the scoop on the spy scene, and Spavin agreed to put something
together. Spav used to cruise the grids of Shiawase's spy department, the MIFD, before a lit-
tle disagreement forced them to part ways. So listen up, because if someone else told you
this, they might have to kill you.

The Great Game. Ever since Kipling coined the phrase in Kim, diplomats have adopted
this euphemism to beautify an ugly exchange of betrayal and treachery. Still, old Rudyard cap-
tured the essence of intelligence and covert operations. In espionage, there are rules to follow
and conventions to uphold. Most important, make sure you never get caught cheating.
RULES OF THE GAME
The technological innovations of the last century, not to mention magic's return, have
radically altered the ways intelligence agencies go about collecting information. While dou-
ble agents and dead-drop letters still have an important part to play, nowadays satellite
imagery, electronic signal collection, Matrix taps, aura scans, detection spells and many other
measures overshadow the old-fashioned cloak-and-dagger methods.
When it comes to methodology, most intelligence-gathering boils down to one of three
categories: signals intelligence (SIGINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT) and human intelligence
(HUMINT). Here's a look at the current trends in playing the spy game.

SIGINT
Ya gotta love technology. Whether it's radio, telephone,
trideo or the Matrix, electronic transmission has made it
ridiculously easy to send information from one far-flung cor-
ner of the world to another. This has made electronic com-
munication the favorite form of media, which subsequently
makes SIGINT the biggest portion of many intelligence agen-
cies' operational budgets.
As any technoweenie fanboy will tell you, signals intelli-
gence consists of two major categories. The collection and
interception of electronic data falls under the category of elec-
tronic intelligence, or ELINT. The other side of the coin is com-
munications intelligence, or COMINT, which involves decrypt-
ing and decoding of the data.
. Depending on which agency you're talking about, there's
also a third type of electronic intelligence called GRIDINT that
covers Matrix-based intelligence gathering. It incorporates ele-
ments of collection and decoding, so it's a hybrid of ELINT and
COMINT. Spavin didn't mention it, partly because he's a purist,
but also because it's far from universal. The Russians, for exam-
ple, still haven't completely embraced the Matrix and so rele-
gate GRIDINT ops to a different department in the UGB from
conventional electronic warfare. On the other hand, the UCAS
takes the attitude that "data is data" and integrates Matrix
operations seamlessly with other signal collection under the
umbrella of the National Security Agency.
· Melkon
· When it comes to encryption and coding, broadcast encryp-
tion tends to be a lot more difficult than data encryption. At
least with data encryption, the data's going to stay the same
over time, but in broadcast encryption, the signal is changing,
and more often than not, so is the coding. You're making an
on-the-fly effort, so the odds really stack up against you.
· MC Jammer
Bugs in the System
The traditional hidden microphone has come a long way in
the past seventy years. Not only do the listening devices keep
getting smaller, but they also collect a variety of other data.
Video, trideo, chemical spectrography, GPS coordinates, ambi-
ent temperature, you name it-if it can be recorded, there's a
bug out there that will track it.
· The UCAS Nuclear Regulatory Commission has a specialized
bug to fight illegal trafficking in radioactive material, particu-
larly for home-brewed nukes and so-called "dirty bombs." The
bug is an ordinary activate-on-demand voice microphone, but
it also contains a GPS receiver and micro-sized radiometer for
measuring radiation levels. Whenever they suspect someone of
trafficking, they plant this "glow bug" on him. That way they
can monitor whatever suspicious characters he's talking to.
and can also pinpoint his location and determine whether
(and sometimes what) radioactive materials are present.
· Seabrook
· Watch out for some of the newer bugs the UGB uses for anti-
insurgent ops. These bugs incorporate inertial sensors, and If
they detect the bug moving more than a gentle nudge, they'll
trigger an explosive charge capable of considerable collater-
al damage. Since too much movement means the operation is
already compromised, or so the Russkies figure, they might as
well try to take down as many as they can.
· Zampolit
It's amazing how small a listening device can get some-
times. The smallest bug I've heard of is microchip-sized, inserted
by a hardware technician into a cyberdeck-not to monitor the
decker's online mischief, but to monitor his offline conversations
with his chummers! Keep in mind, however, there's usually an
inverse relationship between size and performance. Reducing a
bug's size also decreases other important capabilities, such as
transmission range, duration, data storage and the ability to
record other types of data like video or spectrography. If you
want a bug that does it all, don't be surprised if it ends up being
too large to hide.
· Bugging isn't just a physical operation. Many intelligence
deckers plant "bugs" in nodes by using sniffer utilities to inter-
cept data streams and copy all the data traffic being tapped.
Most of the time these sniffers send their data to a dead-drop:
a chip writer that taps into the Matrix from a public location
and writes it onto a chip that an operative later picks up. That
way, if trace IC pinpoints the destination, the trackers end up
going to a public telecom anyone could have used.
· Arclight
One feature that's becoming increasingly common on most
covert surveillance devices is activate-on-demand (AOD). Since
it isn't on all the time, AOD helps lengthen a bug's operational
duration. Furthermore, with recent advances in pattern recogni-
tion technology, newer AOD models can be programmed to
activate only under certain criteria: for example, when a certain
person speaks, or whenever certain keywords are spoken.
. The tech isn't foolproof, though. It all depends on the context,
so there's always a chance of getting a false positive. You have
to be pretty careful how you program the bug. For example, if
you program it to activate whenever it hears anything about
Seattle bombings, it'll go off if it hears, "I can't believe how badly
the Seattle Seadogs bombed last night against Kansas City."
· fhqwhgads
. Come on, fhqwhgads. Where've you been the past couple
of years? The technology isn't absolutely reliable, but the soft-
ware has gotten better at interpreting context.

Riding the Airwaves
Whether it's conventional radio, cellular phone,
microwave or satellite, the easiest way to mansmit and dis-
seminate information goes through the airwaves. Of course,
State of the Art: 2064

Page 4:

NOVATECH
it's also the easiest to monitor, intercept and sometimes even
mess with. The boys and girls in intel figured this out long ago,
which is why they maintain a lot of assets to monitor the air-
waves. And with the wireless Matrix craze starting to really
take off, with things like the European Wireless Matrix
Initiative, the airwaves are going to be even more of a play-
ground for all sides.
. By the same token, the intel agencies are reluctant to pass
highly classified information via electronic transmissions. Even
with encryption and countermeasures like frequency-hop-
ping and such, there's still a chance some unwanted party
will figure out the key and decode the data. It all depends on
how sensitive the intel is. Routine administrative traffic usually
passes through with standard encryption, but highly sensitive
data from deeply placed sources might come strictly through
dedicated landlines or even personally by courier. Of course,
these secure methods are resource-intensive and not very
timely. It's a matter of risk management. Ya rolls yer dice, ya
takes yer chances.
· Whistler
· Because so much traffic passes through the air, the watch-
ers scanning the airwaves might miss something in all the
noise. A couple of cells have figured this out and sometimes
use adolescent chat rooms and message forums to pass
coded messages. The signal-to-noise ratio is abysmally low, so
it may be easy to pass an announcement about an upcom-
ing terror strike, disguising it as gossip about the latest boy
band or teen idol.
· L-JO
Right now, the hot topic in electronic intelligence is the
revival of interest in wireless communications and technology,
such as the Wireless Matrix Initiative being developed in
Scandinavia. For a long time wireless just couldn't overcome
the hurdle of delivering full-sensation Matrix simsense at
broadband speeds, but this WMI looks like it may just make
that breakthrough. Saeder-Krupp Prime is already involved,
attempting to force its way into Erika's labs, and just recently
my old pals inside Shiawase MIFD told me it's a hot item on
Director Kiyomoto's agenda. From what I've heard, even the
NSA and the ERLA are getting in on the action.
IMINT
People say a picture is worth a thousand words. Me, I
wouldn't know firsthand, because MIFD's Imagery Surveillance
Section sucked major hoop. Others, like the CIA, have had
great success with imagery analysis, so it remains a staple of
intelligence gathering and analysis.
Nowadays, drones do the majority of the grunt work for
obtaining imagery data. Drones come in all shapes and sizes,
from handheld microdrones to giant high-altitude unmanned
aircraft. This allows them to get cameras into places no human
being (or dwarf, for that matter) can. Sometimes the drones
store the images in onboard memory, but most of the time
they transmit the footage in real time to nearby riggers.
It's actually a good idea in some circumstances for the
drone to store footage onboard and disconnect from the rig-
ger network. Even though drone networks are more secure
than most RF transmissions, the signals can still be potentially
monitored and intercepted. This is particularly true if you're
operating under EMCON (Emission Control, a.k.a. radio
silence) conditions and don't want to tip your hand with an
unidentified transmission.
· Rigger X
Because drones do most of the paparazzi work for the spooks,
counterintelligence also puts a lot of effort into training and
equipping intelligence riggers to thwart them. Spook riggers are
real damn good (they have to be to stay on top of the game),
and they employ clever uses of MIJI, with particular emphasis on
meaconing and intrusion techniques. Jamming and interfer-
ence are brute-force effective, but most spook riggers I know
think they're crude and unsubtle and shy away from them.
· MC Jammer
Though drones bear the largest share of image collection
work, manned vehicles and personnel still have a role to play.
When inserting eyes on the target is extremely difficult, an
intelligence rigger has to be on site to position the drones in a
perfectly angled yet surreptitious vantage point. Most of the
time. however, manned surveillance serves to coordinate mag-
ical overwatch with technological assets. Between detection
spells and astral projection, magical surveillance can reveal
important information that even the best sensors can't. On the
other hand, information gained this way is mostly in the magi-
cian's mind and can't be transcribed for later analysis.
Consequently, it's important to corroborate magical informa-
tion with other reproducible sources.
· Even though digital photography is ubiquitous in public life,
the Intelligence community still uses traditional film photogra-
phy quite a bit. Intelligence analysts frequently enhance, clean
up and otherwise hand-wring image data to find obscure
details. Film photography, with a resolution that's practically on
the molecular scale, holds up better to such scrubbing than
digital images.
· Ansel A
· Intelligence agencies also use a lot of specialized film for
capturing emissions on normally invisible spectrums. For exam-
ple, they frequently use infrared film for shooting photography
at night without the use of flash or low-light imagery (usually the
case when operatives are working undercover).

. One of the latest advances in the intelligence community is
astral-sensitive film photography. Back in the nineteenth centu-
ry. when photography was in its infancy, a number of plates
revealed phantom images of otherworldly people in the pic-
ture. (For example, the Cottingley fairies, first regarded as a
hoax, were later vindicated by post-Awakening magiclans as
real.) At the time, these spectral photos were blamed on bad
developing, but since the Awakening, psychometric analysis
has revealed that the images were indeed ghosts, or rather,
astral imprints left by the recently departed.
Now before you head down to your local camera store, I
should point out a few things. First, the tech's still classified, obvi-
ously. Also, the equipment is bulky and difficult to use. To cap-
ture astral imprints on film, the technicians had to revert to early
daguerreotype cameras, often with long exposure times. The
models being fielded are impractical for casual snapshots, but
with advance preparation, they can provide invaluable cover-
age of critical areas.
· Holgrave
Eye in the Sky
The biggest gun in the arsenal of imagery intelligence,
without question, is the spy satellite. Only a small number of
agencies actually possess their own spysats. The UCAS (part-
nered with Ares), Russia, Imperial Japan, Novatech and Saeder-
Krupp have the most significant satellite networks.
Aztechnology, Shiawase, the CAS, Israel, MET2000/Argus,
India, Yamatetsu, Amazonia, the Pueblo and Great Britain also
own spy satellites, but their capabilities are substantially limited.
. Though only a few agencies own satellites, many of the oth-
ers can "borrow" satellites from them, usually through favors,
strategic alliances and so on. Mitsuhama, for example, doesn't
own any satellites, but they often call on Shiawase for assis-
tance, usually appealing to Japanacorp solidarity against
common gaijin adversaries.
· Metsuke
· Given the pitiful state of Shiawase's satellites, I'd say MCT
would be better off without it.
· Naginata
With scant exceptions, the large majority of spy satellites
operate in low earth orbit (LEO), staying close to the surface to
maximize scanning resolution. With LEO, however, the satellite
can't perpetually loiter over a location (the usual time ranges
between 12 and 60 hours). This means agencies often have to
pray for luck that they'll have a satellite with the right capabili-
ties in the same general zone of coverage. (Not to mention that
the weather will cooperate as well!)
Satellite scanning comes in three different flavors. Optical
satellite scanning has the best resolution, capable of reading
the license plate of a passing vehicle. Furthermore, it's the only
one that can scan in full color. On the other hand, optical scans
have severe line of sight limitations; they can't scan at night,
and the least bit of cloud cover will block them.
. Though the image quality is so good it's like looking over
someone's shoulder, more often than not the conditions
required to get that are less likely than finding honest, unbiased
reporting during an election year. I've heard many veteran
spies don't bother to request satellite imagery, because nine
times out of ten, it'll either be too cloudy, too dark or not in the
right position to get anything useful.
· Orbital Bandit
· Yes, but on that tenth try, the picture quality is so clear that it
can often make or break a case. As with anything, patience
and a little bit of luck is what's needed to play the Game.
· Agent Midnight
The next level down from optical scanning is infrared
imaging. Infrared scanners function just as well at night as they
do during the day, and they also have limited ability to pene-
trate cloud cover. (A partially overcast day won't hinder them,
but a good storm will.) The image is monochromatic, howev-
er, and the resolution isn't as good. An infrared scan can pick
out the front-page headline of a screamsheet fax, but it's
doubtful any spy could read the actual text of the article.
The lowest rung on the satellite scanning ladder is con-
ventional radar and millimeter wave imaging. You can forget
about pretty pictures for this one, unless you consider teleme-
try data artistic, but by the same token, it's also the least
impeded by weather and visibility. This one mostly has mili-
tary intelligence applications, because metal vehicles show up
real well on radar.
· Radar imaging is pretty much useless for spying in urban,
industrial and other built-up areas, but it's very useful for areas
where there shouldn't be a lot of metal. Counterterrorist oper-
atives, for example, use satellite radar to locate terrorist training
camps in the wilderness. All those explosives, vehicles and
cyberware give distinct signatures that don't resemble rocks or
trees. The same holds true for border patrols, which find satellite
imagery useful in watching for smugglers over large regions,
particularly places with lots of dead spots that local ground
radar tends to overlook.
· Ryan
HUMINT
For all their fancy gizmos and gee-whiz devices, some-
times the only way the intel boys can figure out what's going
on is by asking the man on the scene. This is especially true in
counterterrorist and counterinsurgent operations, where mem-
bers rely on secrecy and word-of-mouth to evade the authori-
ties. Despite all the advances in technology over the past cen-
tury, human intelligence remains a critical component.
Because HUMINT relies on secrecy and deception, it
involves lots of the disguised gadgets that are the staple of
James Bond and other simflicks. Advances in microtronics and
miniaturization technology permit an amazing variety of spe-
cial electronics to be fitted into ordinary handheld objects, like
a ballpoint pen, pocket secretary or digital reader. Additionally,

with contact chemicals like DMSO, many pharmaceutical
agents such as truth serum or NeuroStun can be disguised as
personal hygiene products. And I could go on at length about
the variety of disguised weapons used for wetwork.
. Naturally, most of these gee-whiz toys stay in the hands of
their various agencies, but every now and then a few make
their way into the shadows. Sometimes an agency hires runners
to steal gadgets from a rival agency, and as part of the pay-
ment, they get to keep a portion of the plunder. Also, like
everyone else, the various intel groups have their own private
list of runners on retainer, who get access to these toys in
exchange for their souls-excuse me, loyalty.

· Simchips are popular with intelligence operatives in main-
taining cover identities, particularly personafix BTLs, since they
subsume the user's actual personality to that of the chip. A
chipjack is a dead giveaway to counterintelligence officers, so
most of these are uploaded through induction datajacks into
headware memory. Espionage personafixes (sometimes known
as "aliaschips") probably wouldn't be popular on the black
market. Instead of roleplaying Neal the Ork Barbarian, you'd

Magic Cloak and Enchanted Dagger
Of all the methodologies employed, HUMINT has seen
the greatest amount of change from the Awakening and the
resurgence of magic. This shouldn't surprise anyone. With
spells like mind probe, trid phantasm and invisibility wielded
even by street magicians, the presence of magical support
can make or break the most sophisticated HUMINT operation.
No surprise that the large majority of magicians working in
intelligence specialize in HUMINT operations.
· Don't forget spirits as well. Watchers are common with intelli-
gence conjurers, and spy types are the only ones I know of who
use foci and formal rituals to make watchers smarter and more
effective. Air elementals are also very common, because they
aid detection spells. There aren't a lot of shamans in intelli-
gence work, so nature spirits are pretty rare. This is true even in

metic mages than the rest of the Sioux Council.
· Cardinal
· Intelligence agencies love to use aspected magicians, such
as sorcerers and conjurors. The spooks rely heavily on compart-
mentalized information to prevent and minimize leaks, and a
full magician that can do it all has a lot of resources to find out
more than he's supposed to know. He may be a more effective
spy, but the full magician is also a bigger liability.
· Silicon Mage
Going Deep
While most HUMINT operatives maintain a cover role for
only a short time, a few are in it for the long term. Called deep
cover agents, these operatives play their cover identities to a
tee, sometimes not even consciously aware of their secret role.
Most of the time, deep cover agents don't come into play: by
maintaining their roles as ordinary Joe and Jane Wageslave,
they strengthen their aliases as something other than spies.
When the time is right, the agency activates the agent, who
over time will have wormed his or her way into secrets an ordi-
nary operative could never access.
Because magic makes it really easy to read someone's
mind, deep cover agents undergo extensive brainwashing to
hold up to the rigors of mind probes and psychometrical analy-
sis. These techniques utilize a combination of programmable
ASIST biofeedback and magical psychometrical alteration. It's
expensive, torturous and not always successful, but if done
right it's indistinguishable from the real thing.
. Even to its victims. One tactic the Seraphim have recently
adopted is "recruiting" unwilling personnel for brainwashing. A
Seraph operative is inserted as a clerk into Human Resources,
Social Services, Payroll or other offices with access to personnel
records. From there, he identifies people with access to target-
ed areas that Lucien Cross wants to spy on. Once the
"recruiter" makes and refines the short list, a Cross team kid-
naps those people, brainwashes them into deep cover agents
and then returns them. All they remember is being sick with a
bad flu for the past few days.
· Fallen Angel
This sort of extensive brainwashing makes it very likely
that deep cover agents will forget their real selves, so agencies
often program a memory "key" to unlock the agent's real per-
sonality, which is sublimated deep below the unconscious
mind. Often the key is linked to a strongly emotional event
from the past, and the spooks make sure it's completely irrel-
evant to the agent's current cover so that no one can invoke
the key accidentally. When it's time to bring the agent back,
the agency handler uses a phrase or picture to invoke the key,
and the agent's true self re-emerges.
It's not always that simple. Most of the time after extraction,
an agent still has to go down for rehab, to erase any residual
personality traces and false memories. Skipping rehab is usual-
ly a bad idea, because there's a good chance the cover will
start to "leak" into the real personality-usually at the wrong
time, like the middle of a gunfight or interrogation.
· Quaid
· One new trick performed with deep cover agents by the
Cuban intelligence agency, la Dirección General de
Inteligencia (DGI), is hiring voodoo initiates. These houngans
wield their metamagic to possess personnel with access to sen-
sitive information and use them to get into secure areas.

PATRIOT GAMES
If you really think about it, espionage is a broad term that
describes just about everything that ever takes place in the
shadows. To some degree, we are all freelance covert opera-
tives. using anonymity and deniability as cover while we dig
out secrets, wreak sabotage or perform other kinds of covert
mischief.
THE PRIZE PURSE
The methodologies described above-SIGINT, IMINT,
HUMINT-are just means to an end, the tactics of the battle-
field. Just like war, however, a strategy guides these tactics and
dictates where to fight the battles. Intelligence takes place in
different arenas, each of which has its own goals and some-
times its own rules.
Political Intelligence
Political intelligence is old-school espionage: back-room
meetings at the embassy ball, bugged prostitutes sleeping with
politicians, staff moles and so on. Basically, it's all about people:
spying on prominent figures to uncover hidden agendas.
Of course, in the Byzantine landscape of the Sixth World,
political intelligence extends beyond embassies and politicians
to include megacorporations and non-governmental organiza-
tions like the Draco Foundation. What distinguishes this type of
operation from the typical shadowrun is that the subject mat-
ter tends to be more societal than technological: the CIA does-
n't spy on Mitsuhama to get the scoop on their latest drone
program, for example, but cares a whole lot about an organi-
zational reshuffling that moves jobs out of the UCAS into
CalFree. Even though the scope has expanded beyond nations,
politics and social intrigue remain central in the realm of polit-
ical intelligence.
· Speaking of social intrigue, what happened to Spook, our res-
ident joygirl-turned-spy-turned-shadowrunner? I would have

· Actually, a mutual chummer found out Maria got picked up

ested again after fifteen years. Maybe something she knew
from way back when, or maybe they needed her for one last
mission. Anyway, she hasn't been heard from since. Hope she
manages to come back.
· Clever Dan
One of the peculiarities of political spying is that, to a lim-
ited degree, it's expected, even tolerated. Political asylum,
extraterritoriality, diplomatic immunity-it's all part of the Game
governments have developed over the centuries. These things
began as a means to keep a country's legitimate ambassadors
safe from legal entrapment while abroad, but over time, they've
evolved into convenient excuses to place spies somewhere.
. Diplomatic immunity is a double-edged sword. It may make
you safe from prosecution, but that doesn't always mean you
can brazenly walk the streets. They might not arrest you, but
they'll definitely follow you around. The cops can also temporar-
ily detain you while they're "verifying your credentials," usually at
the most inconvenient time. Lastly, to possess diplomatic immu-
nity, your name has to be on file somewhere, which means all
your dirty little secrets are there for public inspection.
· spudman
. Also, if a country or corp is going to grant you something as
valuable as diplomatic immunity, five will get you ten that
they've done a background check and know lots of little
secrets you might not know yourself.
· Bourne
. And just because the authorities can't arrest you doesn't mean
they can't hire deniable assets like shadowrunners to take you
out. Diplomatic immunity is no protection against a bullet.
· Murtaugh
One item that a lot of people forget about is the diplomat-
ic pouch. Legally speaking, a foreign official can't open a diplo-
matic pouch; it's sealed from the moment it leaves its home
country until it arrives at its destination embassy or consulate. In
theory, there's no limit to the size of a diplomatic pouch; you
could mark a modular cargo container as a "diplomatic pouch"
and no one gets to open it. In practice, though, most diplomat-
ic pouches don't get much bigger than a large briefcase
. A diplomatic pouch may legally protect its contents from
being searched, but they can still be snatched. A couple of
months ago the FBI hired me and other mates to intercept a
CAS diplomatic pouch going to the Confederation consulate
in Boston. The Feds suspected someone on the staff was using
the pouch to smuggle in BTLs from Nashville to sell on the
Southie streets. When we intercepted the pouch, we inserted a
tracker chip into it, which helped to finger the culprit.

place, just about all of Europe's intelligence services couldn't
resist the temptation to throw in a few ringers to eavesdrop on
conversations. Heck, even some outsiders like the CAS and
Israel have a few agents crashing the parties to get the scoop
on what's going down.
. The CAS angle isn't too hard to figure out. Ever since
Ghostwalker took up roost in Denver, Saeder-Krupp has been
getting pretty cozy
with the Confederation. The
Confederationists aren't dummies, however, and they proba-
bly trust Lofwyr as far as they can throw him. The ERLA has been
leading negotiations with Saeder-Krupp, so I guess they placed
a few agents on the Grand Tour to make sure the CAS didn't
get double-crossed by the dragon.

Ibn Elsa: Damn the fool who set up that assassination
attempt on Ibn Eisa. Up until that point, most of the intelli-
gence circles had almost managed to figure out what was
going on in the Middle East. But ever since someone took a
shot at the head of the Islamic Unity Movement (IUM), Ibn
Eisa's a new man, and everything we thought we knew about
the Middle East has been turned on its head. All the intelli-
gence work over the past thirty years has now amounted to
nothing. On behalf of all the spooks risking their necks in the
Middle East, frag you very much.
· Though everyone initially suspected Mossad of doing the
deed, most intelligence agencies have pretty much ruled them
out. I don't know why people thought of them in the first place;
it would have amounted to suicide for the Israeli state. Of course,
that leaves a tougher question: if the Israelis didn't do it, who
did? A lot of signs point to the merc group 10K Daggers in
Constantinople, but then you have to ask who hired them.

Military Intelligence
War and intelligence practically go hand-in-hand. Many of
the premier intelligence agencies today either started out as
part of a nation's armed forces or came into existence during
wartime.
Sometimes the line blurs between military intelligence, as
performed by intelligence operatives, and reconnaissance, as
performed by soldiers and mercs. Both seek information: troop
movements, operational plans, tactical communications and so

on. For the most part, military recon takes place in the field
near the front lines, while intelligence takes place further to the
rear, particularly around military headquarters, shipyards, air
bases and so on.
If you look across the globe, it might strike you as peculiar
that many countries employ two agencies for military intelli-
gence, one mostly composed of civilians, the other mostly of
service members (officers and enlisted). In theory, the two
branches are supposed to cooperate; the civilians talk to the
diplomatic attachés, while the uniforms go into the field to
coordinate with the force commanders. In practice, however,
branch rivalries and mutual suspicion often thwart any coordi-
nated effort, instead resulting in miscommunication and lost
opportunities.
. You can always use this civilian-military rivalry to your advan-
tage. Because the two sides generally don't trust the other guy
to provide the full story, they often put their own assets in the
field, resulting In a duplication of effort. Sometimes the two
don't even know the other side also has field operatives
involved in the mission.
· Arctic White
Scan that. Lockheed once hired me and my buds to steal the
plans for an attack helicopter prototype from a CAS test facility
in Dallas. After doing initial legwork, we found that the UCAS
was also Interested in this project, and both the CIA and DIA
(Defense Intelligence Agency, a civilian intelligence outfit work-
ing for the Pentagon) had sent teams down. We played both
sides by pretending to be the other agency and sending them
scurrying in different directions. From what I heard, they still
haven't figured out in DeeCee just what the hell was going on.
. Diamondback
With the North American Pacific Coast primed for war,
most of the military attention is focused there. Many of the
conflicts are advancing toward hostilities, so the intelligence
work is shifting toward battlefield support. Covert ops, howev-
er, still have first priority in the following situations:
The California Protectorate: Saito's failed attempt to
seize the Central Valley dam poured cold water (pardon the
pun) on the Little Colonel's megalomaniacal dreams. It cost
him a lot of men and resources just when support from his
backers was declining, so he's had to retrench. This situation
has created an opportunity for a three-way intelligence alliance
to form between Japan, Tir Tairngire and Pueblo. The three
share information, not only because of concern over Saito, but
also because each has a different strength; Japan has the best
chance of placing covert operatives in Saito's military, Tir
Tairngire excels in magical espionage and the Pueblo cover the
technical aspects.
UCAS-Sioux Cold War: Ever since the NAN managed to
carve out part of the American West back in 2017, the UCAS
and the Sioux have never gotten along. The border between the
two is always on guard, with each side daring the other to make
a mistake. While neither side really wants to go to war, both the
Sioux Office of Military Intelligence and the UCAS DIA probe
each other to find exploitable weaknesses should it occur.
· And caught right in between is Ares Macrotechnology, par-
ticularly Knight Errant, which handles most of Ares' intelligence
duties. On the one side, Ares Arms maintains cozy relationships
with the Defense Department and technical agencies like the
NSA and NRO. On the other side, Knight Errant's boss, Roger
Soaring Owl, is a Sioux expatriate and has lots of friends in the
Sovereign Tribal Council. Both the OMI and the CIA suspect Ares
of playing both sides, but their superiors have overruled the
agencies. If you don't mind sneaking around a bunch of military
types, there's plenty of work proving if this suspicion is real or not.
· Squire
Technical Intelligence
It's a simple truth we all know: the SOTA never stays still. If
you want to get ahead in life, you gotta stay ahead of the curve.
It's the reality of the shadows, and also of intelligence work.
Despite the name, technical intelligence actually incorpo-
rates technology and magic, plus operating methodologies
and doctrine. The focus is spycraft, the methods and tools used
to gather intelligence and be sneaky about it. As such, it cov-
ers a wide array of topics: encryption algorithms, weapon sys-
tems, new spells and ritual techniques, conventional electron-
ics, tactics and standard operating procedures and so on. If you
know what's in the other guy's playbook, you're halfway
toward beating him.
Because megacorporations do the actual research, devel-
opment and production of all the gee-whiz toys and spells,
corporate intelligence services do the grunt work of technical
intelligence. Government intelligence agencies, however, keep
a few fingers in this particular pie. Part of this is academic, the
tactics and methodologies I mentioned before. The spooks also
want to stay abreast of what the corps are doing, what tech
they're developing and to whom they intend to sell it.
One particular aspect of technical intelligence that's
always been a priority is tracking the development of weapons
of mass destruction. Whether it's biowarfare agents, nukes or
ritual blood magic. developed nations are very concerned
about WMD proliferation, particularly among those notorious
for state-sponsored terrorism. In a lot of cases, many countries
and certain corps have set up specialized agencies solely ded-
icated to tracking WMDs.
. The Sioux Office of Military Intelligence has one such depart-
ment operating under the code name Task Force: Tyee. TF Tyee
tracks the development and usage of grand ritual magic like
the Ghost Dance and Azzie blood magic, not to mention
Awakened phenomena occurring on a wide scale, like the
resurging forests in Tir Tairngire or the Mists of Brittany. Though
the NAN was the first to use grand ritual magic, their magical
edge has severely eroded to the point where it's no longer the
trump card it used to be. In particular, revelations about Azzie

ried; they used to be allies, but nowadays the Sioux see Aztlan

. Nukes are the biggie when it comes to WMD. A lot of the old
nuclear powers broke apart during the course of this century,
and so there are a lot more players in the nuke game than
there ever were before. Here's a quick rundown of the major
players by region.
North America: When the old US of A split apart, so did its
nuclear triad. The CAS inherited most of the US sub fleet, the
UCAS got the silos in the Dakotas, and the two divided the
bomber force between them. Both keep them up-to-date, the
UCAS to ward off the threat of another Ghost Dance, the CAS
to discourage the Azzies from moving further north.
Europe: Despite the changes in the political landscape
since the Manhattan Project, the European nuclear powers
(Great Britain, France and Russia) have remained mostly intact.
Russia lost a good chunk of its arsenal to the Ukraine when the
Soviet Union broke up in 1991, but the Ukrainians got rid of most
(but not all) of them. France still conducts regular underground
testing, mostly offshore from French Guyana, as a show of
bravado against Amazonia and Saeder-Krupp.
The Far East: A major earthquake in the Tai-Hei mountain
range sealed China's primary arsenal in 2017, pretty much the
final nail in the communists' coffin. Every now and then a war-
lord claims to have a few, but most of those remaining are in
the hands of the major fragmentary states: Sichuan, the
Canton Confederation, Henan and Shaanxi.
Officially, Japan has no nukes, but don't believe it for a
moment. After Korea II, Japan sent Imperial troops as "security
watch" over North Korean nukes, and the Imperial Court also
helped build up MCT's stockpile, provided that Mitsuhama put
them at the empire's service when needed.
Central Asia: A nuclear exchange with Pakistan back in
the 2020s turned most of Kashmir into a wasteland. India still
maintains a capable stockpile, not only as a deterrent against
Pakistan, but also against Sichuan and Japan. Pakistan's
nuclear program is notorious for its leaks, particularly from
unscrupulous scientists and generals selling secrets to terrorists
and policlubs.
The Middle East: When Israel nuked Libya in retaliation for
a chemical attack on Tel Aviv, it put to rest all debate about
Israel's nuclear capability. Since Israel doesn't have a lot of real
estate, most of their nukes reside on board missile subs. Rumors
say Mossad has a few underground nukes buried in strategic
points across the Middle East as a final option.
The Megacorps: While all of the Big Ten (and a few AAs)
have at least a token stockpile (a dozen or less devices), only
Ares, Saeder-Krupp and Mitsuhama possess significantly large
amounts. Saeder-Krupp has the biggest devices in terms of
yield, most of them hidden in mountain sites under the eyes of

S-K Prime. Ares maintains mostly orbital nukes for high-atmos-
phere EMP strikes, plus many low-yield devices for "surgical"
strikes, like they used against the bugs in Chicago.
· Skywarp
. Another important but often-overlooked form of WMDs is
bioweapons, like Doom, Strain-III, Ebola Plus and that old
favorite, anthrax. Unlike nukes, many of the major players in the
bioweapons game tend to be corps rather than countries:
Universal Omnitech/Aztechnology, Shiawase, Cross, Proteus
and several others. This fact alone makes many intelligence
agencies nervous, especially when you consider the top
bioweapon stockpilers have no political agenda other than
selling to the highest bidder (all too often someone who does
have a dangerous agenda).
Surprisingly, not many countries actually employ
bioweapons. Most either have nukes or powerful magic rituals
as part of their arsenals, both of which tend to be flashier and
more attention-grabbing. Bioweapons also tend to be notori-
ously unpredictable, which makes them very bad for PR.
. Daniels
Counterintelligence
As any sportsman will tell you, sometimes the best
offense is a good defense. While it's important to learn the
other side's secrets, it's just as important to the spooks to pro-
tect their own. That's the role of counterintelligence (some-
times abbreviated as CI): to suss out the moles and double
agents inside their own organizations.
. CI spooks aren't the most popular people, especially on the
inside. Because they're always on the lookout for moles, they
trust no one and suspect everyone.
· Haisley
· Counterintelligence also covers disinformation, the deliber-
ate planting of false information for other spies to report back
to their handlers. Agencies do this for several reasons. In some
cases, the agency is trying to fool the other side into believing
something that isn't true; this hopefully forces the other side to
make the wrong decisions. In other cases, the agency spreads
disinformation as a way of blowing covers. They disclose the
info to a small number of suspected moles; if the fake news
turns up elsewhere, the agency then knows where to look.
· Cardinal
Because espionage is a criminal activity in practically all
jurisdictions, CI is often the responsibility of law enforcement.
For example, the FBI handles most counterintelligence cases in
the UCAS. More authoritarian countries, however, may keep CI
together with other agency duties, effectively forming a secret
police force.
· With civil unrest rising in many countries, like Tir Tairngire and
Great Britain, many intelligence agencies are getting pressed
into service to help catch agitators and infiltrate resistance
movements.
· Little Drummer Girl
Like HUMINT for external operations, CI has transformed
significantly since the Awakening. With spells like mind probe
and analyze truth, it's become hideously easy to sniff out insid-
ers who shouldn't belong. With the way magic has revolution-
ized CI, many agencies have developed other tricks to counter
these techniques.
· Mind probe spells aren't as common in counterintelligence as
everyone thinks. For one thing, mages are a scarce resource;
there's only one magician for every 150 or so personnel, and
many of them are assigned to operations other than CI. Also,
mind probe spells are just as excruciating for the magician as
they are to their target. (Small comfort for anyone who's been
mind-raped.) Over time, extensive usage of mind probe erodes
the magician's own personality and results in a major psycho-
logical breakdown. Considering how scarce magicians are in
the first place. intelligence agencies don't like burning out the
few magicians they have.
. Carnac the Magnificent
. Carnac's hit it on the head. Mind probe is the magical equiv-
alent of a full-cavity strip search. Intel magicians, however,
have other, less intrusive spells that are just as effective.
Recently, the CAS's main intelligence agency, the Department
of Strategic Intelligence (DSI), developed a spell they call word
recognition. Basically, the caster telepathically transmits a
name, image or person into the mind of their target and
gauges the subject's subconscious reaction to it. For example,
if a DSI staff clerk shows reaction to the name of a CIA handler,
chances are good she's a mole reporting to the CIA officer.
· Interrupter Jones
As mentioned before, simsense brainwashing is the most
effective cover from mind probes, but it's expensive, time-con-
suming and tortuous. Also, repeated treatments tend to lose
effectiveness. Alias personachips are the next step down, but
they sometimes risk BTL addiction. Non-addictive chips are
also available, but they're less effective.
One technique agencies have hit upon lately is "flooding" a
target area with covert operatives whose sole purpose is to
decoy CI magicians. Because magicians are a scarce resource,
they can't track all those spies. With so many possibly suspicious
characters around, the spooks hope the mage locks onto a red
herring, while the real operatives get lost in the crowd.
Counterterrorism and Counterinsurgency
More than any other time in history, the threat from ter-
rorist and trans-national subversive groups has put counterin-
surgent operations high on many agencies' agendas. In some
countries, armed subversives are more of a threat than hostile
neighbors or megacorps.
16
State of the Art: 2064

Page 12:
GAMES OF STATE
NOVATECH
Though some subversives receive funding from other
nations, in many cases these groups are self-motivated by
cause and receive funding, material support and recruitment
from like-minded people. Because of these groups' highly per-
sonal nature, many agencies rely heavily on HUMINT tactics,
with electronic surveillance and image collection falling into
support roles. Many subversive groups employ a cell structure,
so placing agents among the real decision-makers is a chancy
and time-consuming effort.
· One tactic adopted by intelligence agencies in Europe and
North America is using agents to lead pseudo-subversive orga-
nizations. The British originally developed this practice during
their colonial days in Ireland and Africa. These phony groups
recruit from the disaffected and divert their anger and resent-
ment into safer, ineffective directions. This takes away the
recruitment base from the real subversives and also creates
infighting and ineffective leadership among them.
· Reilly
The subversive threat varies from region to region, but
two particular groups have been raising a bunch of red flags
with agencies around the world.
Winternight: Given their stated intent to initiate global
apocalypse and their obsession with weapons of mass destruc-
tion, Winternight ranks near the top of many agencies' priority
lists. Thankfully they still haven't eclipsed the Chicago
Shattergraves as the worst terrorist incident in history, but that
just makes a lot of people even more nervous. Statistically
speaking, they're due to stage a major attack soon. The word
out of Europe is that Winternight has put their plans for global
apocalypse on the back burner while they plan something
major against the Matrix, which Winternight hates with a pas-
sion. If the rumors are true, they're plotting something that will
make the Crash of '29 look like a minor system glitch.
Deus: When you look at it in a certain way, the Renraku
Arcology lockdown could be classified as a terrorist act.
Though the arcology has been freed, lots of questions remain.
Many of the Al's banded otaku are still at large, and not every-
one's convinced Deus itself is entirely gone. There's a good
chance of the Al and/or its otaku staging another lockdown,
anywhere, anytime.
THE PLAYING PIECES
With the fragmentation of many countries over the past
century, far too many intelligence agencies exist out there to
summarize in one upload. Instead, I thought I'd choose some
of the major players in intelligence circles today.
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
Headquarters: George H. W. Bush Center for Intelligence,
Langley, North Virginia (UCAS)
Director of Central Intelligence: Robert Henninger
One of the grand dames of the Great Game, the CIA has
garnered a reputation for being the biggest bunglers in the
intelligence community. I can tell you that ain't true. Though
the CIA has seen some pretty spectacular blunders, most of
their so-called "failures" are media spectacles to lull their foes
into a false sense of security.
As the senior UCAS intelligence service, the CIA (known
as "The Company" among UCAS spooks) provides guidance
and direction for the other specialized intelligence agencies.
The structure of UCAS intelligence is peculiar, with indepen-
dent agencies handling most specialized intelligence ops. For
example, the National Security Agency conducts all SIGINT
ops, while the National Reconnaissance Office runs most of the
UCAS spy satellites and the FBI handles domestic counterintel-
ligence. In many cases these jurisdictional disputes hamper
ongoing operations, as different jurisdictions find themselves
working at cross purposes. Nominally the CIA is responsible for
coordination and strategic leadership, but the ugly reality of
internal politics makes it hard to implement.
· Even given the strange way UCAS intelligence is subdivided,
these obstacles can still be overcome with the right leadership.
The problem is, right now there isn't any. The current DCI,
Robert Henninger, has been waging a personal feud with the
Secretary of Defense, Michael Broeder, ever since his appoint-
ment. This has resulted in a lot of infighting among the agen-
cies, with the CIA on one side and the Pentagon on the other.
The smaller sub-agencies, like the NSA, NRO and so on, have
been picking sides, allying with one and switching sides when
convenience dictates otherwise.
· Quinn
Despite all the setbacks faced by the US and then the
UCAS, the CIA still is one of the most technologically advanced
intelligence agencies, rivaled only by the Imperial Japanese and
the Pueblo. This is due in no small part to the friendly relation-
ship between the UCAS government and Ares
Macrotechnology. On the other hand, this relationship puts the
CIA in a bind, because Ares uses its government contacts to
run interference anytime the CIA turns its eyes on them. This
has infuriated DCI Henninger, since he's convinced Ares is
deliberately exacerbating tensions between the UCAS and
Sioux to profiteer on government contracts.
· Henninger is right, but he's got the wrong culprit. The first rule
of dirty tricks is "Don't drek where you eat," and the UCAS is
Ares' home base. Someone is definitely escalating hostilities on
both sides, but it's not Ares.
· Bullet
· The New Revolution?
. Poly Chromatique
One item gaining attention within the CIA is the upswing
of independent political advertising in the UCAS. 2064 is a
presidential election year, and the political machines are crank-
ing up for the lowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary. The
CIA, however, has noticed an unusual amount of smear cam-

paigning and negative advertising, most of it by policlubs
whose affiliations are a mystery. CIA analysts suspect outside
tampering, and their eyes are turning south.
. | doubt they'll find the answer here. Our political season is
starting up too, and we've spotted the same increase in mud-
slinging by dubious policlubs. Somebody's messing with the
elections of both countries, that's for certain.
· Atlanta Spy
The UGB
Headquarters: Lubyanka Square, Moscow, Russia
Chief Director: Rassily Romanov
The Upravleniye Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti, or UGB,
has as widespread and notorious a reputation as their historical
rival, the CIA. The UGB is the latest incarnation of the Russian
secret police, starting with the tsarist Okhranka and continuing
through the Leninist Cheka, the NKVD of World War 2 and the
KGB of the Cold War. The current UGB came into existence in
2010 after Chelenko came to power and reconsolidated the
various KGB departments dispersed at the end of the Cold War.
Though the UGB saw its authority reduced under the
Democratic Recovery Alliance after the Euro Wars, it remained
intact and regained authority when the National Soviet
Reconstructionists took control of Russia.
. When the DRA cut down the UGB after the Euro Wars. they
also eliminated many of the agency's dirty tricks departments,
such as assassination. Many UGB ex-assassins, however, saw the
writing on the wall and went freelance in advance, forming the
hit-group-for-hire Chimera. (In case you forgot, many folks think
Chimera assassinated Seattle Mafia Don James O'Malley.)
How's that for irony? In an effort to clean up the UGB, the
Russian democrats ended up creating the deadliest freelance
assassin group in the world.
· Anya
I think the UGB still has ties with Chimera's founding members.
Last year Pavel Surzpoi, a bishop of the Russian Orthodox
Church in St Petersburg, died from a lethal injection of ricin
delivered from a ballpoint pen. Surzpoi had a lot of political
friends and was gaining a level of influence within the NSR that
the UGB deemed a threat.
· Grigor
State of the Art: 2064

Page 14:

NOVATECH
One distinction that sets the UGB apart from other intelli-
gence services is that it runs the Border Guards, a militarized
force responsible for securing Russia's borders and providing
first-line defense against invaders. Ever since the Yakut seces-
sion, most Border Guard units have shifted east to protect the
Trans-Siberian Railway and the narrow corridor to the Russian
Far East. Because of this responsibility, UGB agents often have
easy access to heavy military weapons and vehicles. UGB intel-
ligence operations tend to be more thuggish, placing heavy
emphasis on assassination and intimidation.
· What an understatement. A couple of years ago, the UGB
suspected Colonel Piotr Ridzik, an intelligence officer with the
Russian Army, of selling information to Saeder-Krupp Prime.
They arranged for him to hook up with a dinner "escort" at a
restaurant in St. Petersburg. She got up to powder her nose and
left her purse at the table. Her purse contained a bomb that
blew up the entire restaurant, taking out Ridzik and a dozen
others! Calling the UGB thugs is way too kind.
· Tikonov
· It was a wasted effort, too, because a couple of shadowrun-
ners (I won't say who) managed to get in and spirit Ridzik away
before the bomb went off. The good colonel now works for
Saeder-Krupp under a new identity somewhere in Europe.
. Rabid Fox
In the Byzantine intrigues of Russian politics, the UGB is one
of multiple factions jockeying for advantage within the govern-
ment. The UGB, however, suffers from its own internal factional-
ism. Rassily Romanov, Chief Director of the UGB, currently heads
up the strongest faction. He has the backing of Saeder-Krupp,
which has close ties to the UGB Border Guards. Opposing
Romanov is Boris Petuchkin, head of Service R, the department
responsible for foreign operations. Petuchkin has ties to Zeta
ImpChem, who also have a significant presence in Russia, partic-
ularly around Nizhniy Novgorod. Another faction strong enough
to challenge Romanov is led by Anastasia Becherzvezda, head of
Department K, domestic intelligence. Department K has many
suspected ties to the Vory mobs, who pay off the UGB to shield
their criminal operations from the MVD.
· With the General Secretary's recent illness, the UGB has been
putting considerable thought into who should succeed the
leader of the Russian Federation should he pass away. (Which,
according to my sources, may happen very soon.) UGB sup-
porters within the NSR are garnering support for Viktor
Kamendin, the Chief Director before Romanov. Kamendin is a
consummate politician and stepped down from the Chief
Director's position only to pursue more power in politics.
· Stormavik
. One faction that hasn't gotten much notice (and probably
should) is Department Y, in charge of securing Russia's nuclear
arsenal. Department Y keeps a low profile amid all the intra-
departmental bickering in the UGB, even going so far as to
sever Matrix connections for several sites. A couple of months
ago, though, a report circulated through British intelligence
that several known Department Y operatives met with mem-
bers of the Scandinavian Aesir Society. Why should this raise
concerns? Aesir has ties to Winternight; it shouldn't be too hard
to make the connection.
· Novichok
Lately, the UGB has been directing an unusual amount of
attention eastward, toward Yakut. Since last year, the UGB
Border Guards have started hiring mercs out of Constantinople
through front companies. Reports I've heard also suggest the
UGB has been putting out feelers toward insurgents in and
around Lake Baykal. If you like traipsing around in the woods
and you speak Russian, you should probably check this out.
Something big is going to happen, and pretty soon.
. Yeah, I remember that. Picador mentioned that last year.
Didn't someone post something about a white rock or whatev-
er? Anyone figure out what that was about?
. Flak Jack
. Apparently there's a site called Sagan Zaba ("White Rock")
on Olkhon Island offshore from the western edge of Lake
Baykal, some 200 kilometers or so northeast from Irkutsk. The
Sagan Zaba is actually a cliff of white rock jutting up from the
water, and some caves have formed in the crevasses between
the rocks. In and around Sagan Zaba are some petroglyphs
(stone drawings) and other remains from an ancient Siberian
settlement dating back several thousand years. Perhaps some
relic or ancient secret there can be used against the Yakut
shapeshifters?

Mossad
Headquarters: Tel Aviv, Israel
Director: Amos Ben Yakhin
Mossad, short for Mossad le-Modiin ule-Tafkidim
Meyuhadim ("Institute for Intelligence and Special Tasks") is
Israel's primary intelligence service. Responsible for human
intelligence collection, covert action and counterterrorism, its
focus has centered primarily on Arab nations and Arab organi-
zations throughout the world. (Hardly surprising, given Israel's

perpetually precarious position.) A secondary mission is helping
Jewish refugees escape from regions where they are persecut-
ed (like the Middle East, Africa and Europe) to safety in Israel.
Because of the constant threat Israel faces from Arab ter-
rorists, Mossad has become one of the best counterterrorist
intelligence agencies in the world, often lending out its exper-
tise to allies like the CAS. Its experience gives Mossad particu-
lar insight into the workings of policlubs and armed activist
groups all over the planet. Other strengths include psycholog-
ical warfare, propaganda and assassination.
. The Israelis are adept at integrating magic into intelligence
operations as well. Ever since magic went mainstream back in
the 2020s or so, there have been rumors that Mossad had a
cell of Qabbalist magicians at its beck and call, making it one
of the first intelligence agencies to use magic in its operations.
· Malachite
. Some people suspect the Israelis also got covert support from
the great dragon Nachtmeister, before Lofwyr snuffed him out
over Frankfurt. One of Israel's biggest investors was the Frankfurt
Bank Association (FBV), and in the fallout after Frankfurt a lot of
ties have emerged between Nachtmeister and the FBV. With
Nachtmeister dead and the FBV entangled in the mess with
Proteus, the Israelis have been searching for another ally. Word
is they've been looking at Aden lately. The great dragon loves
causing trouble in the Middle East, and Israel has been nothing
but trouble since day one.
· as Sadiq
With the firestorm of controversy surrounding Ibn Eisa's
apparent death and resurrection, Mossad has found itself
under siege, from outside and within. The Israeli government
is upset that Mossad may have undertaken such a high-profile
hit without consultation, especially given the mounting threat
posed to the country. Mossad has been desperately seeking
the actual killer to back up its own claim to innocence, while
still trying to figure out what to make of the new situation. A
lot of ongoing missions in North America and Africa have
moved to the back burner while Mossad turns to its now-crit-
ical priorities: Ibn Eisa, the Islamic Unity Movement and the
New Islamic Jihad.
. Why is everyone on Shadowland willing to acquit the Israelis
of this crime? The so-called link to 10K Daggers is tenuous at
best and smells of a red herring. Tel Aviv is only mad at Mossad
because the assassination blew up in their faces.

. I'm not sure if we'll ever know just who ordered the hit on Ibn
Eisa. I don't think we can rule out the Israelis just yet, but given

Argus
Headquarters: Zentrum für Auskunftverwaltung, Baumholder,
Badisch-Pfalz (AGS)
Commandant of Intelligence: Generalleutnant Otto Seicean
In this century of megacorporate domination, it's
inevitable that some independent organizations provide free-
lance intelligence services. Argus is one such freelancer, the
intelligence arm of the mercenary group MET 2000. Though
initially formed to provide military intelligence support to MET
2000, Argus has grown to the point where it now takes on its
own intelligence contracts independent from the organization.
This has made Argus one of the world's major intelligence-for-
hire agencies, along with Aegis Cognito, Infolio and Esprit.
With more than ten thousand agents worldwide, Argus is
the largest independent for-hire intelligence agency in exis-
tence. As a derivative of MET 2000, Argus specializes in mili-
tary intelligence, and its major clients include governments and
organizations unable to maintain a standing intelligence
agency, including the United Nations and the Allied German
States. (Argus also performs the majority of non-military intel-
ligence on behalf of the AGS.)
Argus has spent most of the past year trying to figure out
the Proteus mess. After the great dragon Lofwyr bested
Nachtmeister in a death match over the Frankfurt skyline, hid-
den ties began to surface linking the dead dragon to the mys-
tery corp. With its draconic master gone, Proteus found itself
the target of a shadow war with its one-time partner, the
Frankfurt Bank Association (FBV). From there things get even
more complicated, as Ares gets dragged in, the biggest naval
battle since Jutland takes place in the North Sea and Proteus
ends up suing Ares in the Corporate Court. (They only settled
recently.) If Argus has this tangle sussed out, they haven't told
anyone yet.
. They haven't told anyone because someone inside Argus
knew too much about what was going on. Proteus paid off
someone to look the other way on certain details that would
have gotten the AGS and certain Eurocorp clients of Argus up
in arms. Even the Inspector General from MET 2000 has been
down here demanding to know what's going on, and appar-
ently the blood is running ankle deep in Baumholder.
· Jagdpanther
The Argus cover-up is just a symptom of the problem. Bitter
factionalism and rivalry within Argus often pits one depart-
ment, branch or action team against another. As a for-hire
agency. Argus often finds itself in a situation where a depart-
ment working for one client may be in direct conflict with
another Argus department working for the opposition. Of
course, Argus maintains a strict neutrality policy and has pro-
cedures in place for dealing with these conflicts of interest.
Over time, however, some ugly internecine rivalries have
erupted that literally drew blood.

. Picador, if you're out there, I've got some new information for
you. If what I heard is right, one of these factions within Argus
may have assassinated Matador last year in the Northwest.
Someone in Argus hired Matador and a couple of others for a
mission in Asia, and apparently something happened recently
inside Argus that forced Matador's employer to take him and
the others out as a means of covering tracks. This probably isn't
the best place to discuss it; drop me a line through the usual

The ERLA
Headquarters: Chambliss Center, Kennesaw, Georgia (CAS)
Chief Registrar: David Mobley
In this new world order of corporate extraterritoriality, you
really shouldn't be surprised to see at least a few agencies ded-
icated exclusively to spying on the megacorps. The CAS
Extraterritoriality Registry and Liaison Agency (ERLA), head-
quartered just outside the Atlanta sprawl in Kennesaw, is one
of them, and I have to admit they were one of the worthiest
adversaries I've ever tangled with while I was with the MIFD.
When the Confederation seceded from the infant UCAS
back in the early 2030s, no doubt they were still smarting from
the Seretech and Shiawase court decisions back around millen-
nium's end. Established under the Commerce Act of 2032, the
ERLA maintains a registry of all extraterritorial property within
Confederation borders, and it also has the unusual power of
final approval over real estate transactions with extraterritorial
entities. This gives the CAS the option of "evicting" a corp from
its facility and ending extraterritoriality.
. The CAS has only used the so-called Eviction Clause once,
back when Cord Insurance and North American Eagle were
fighting in the streets of Atlanta. When it became apparent that
Cord would outlast NAE in the war of attrition, the
Confederation invoked the clause on Eagle offices within city
limits, as a preemptive move to end the conflict. Already
wounded by its fight with Cord, Eagle subsequently broke up
and got absorbed by Cord, HKB and Aztechnology. The CAS
knows better than to try that against a healthy AA megacorp,
let alone the Big Ten, but it did nevertheless serve notice that the
Confederation was willing and able to play hardball if it had to.
· The Keynesian Kid
That, of course, is its nominal purpose, tracking the
extraterritorial corps and leading negotiations with them. In
practice, however, that purpose provides a convenient cover
for its real mission: spying on the megacorps and running black
ops where extraterritoriality would normally keep the CAS out.
In contrast to its DSI counterparts in the State Bureau, the ERLA
generally plays down electronic intelligence and prefers a
more personal touch, placing a strong emphasis on human
intelligence.
. Because of their predilection for HUMINT, the ERLA generally
has better magical intelligence assets than any other
Confederation agency. When the CAS issued its injunction
against voodoo practitioners during the early shedim scare, the
DDI (Department of Domestic Investigation) had to beg for mag-
ical help from the ERLA in tracking down houngans and mam-
bos. The ERLA has been saving that favor for a rainy day.
· Atlanta Spy
Oddly enough, the ERLA's specialty has led to some
unusual cooperation north of the border with the CIA. Ares
Macrotechnology has historically maintained a cozy relation-
ship with the UCAS government, and the megacorp uses its
connections to run bureaucratic interference every time the
Company turns a suspicious eye toward Detroit. Subsequently,
the CIA established an under-the-table relationship with the
ERLA. In exchange for any dirt dug up on Ares, the CIA pro-
vides the ERLA with secret assistance in infiltrating extraterri-
torial corps on UCAS soil. The politicos on both sides of the
Mason-Dixon aren't happy with the arrangement, but it gets
results, so they don't complain too much.
. The relationship between the ERLA and the CIA was coziest
back in the late 2040s and early 2050s, when the UCAS and CAS
were establishing a sort of détente. At one point, the CIA used
its relationship with the ERLA to bypass government oversight on
certain black ops, under the cover of a fictitious agency called
Consular Operations, or ConsOps for short. Because they tech-
nically weren't UCAS operatives, ConsOps got away with a lot
of things the CIA couldn't. After the debacle with General Trahn
in 2055, however, Secretary of State Gerald Humphrey brought
ConsOps to an abrupt end, following accusations of CAS med-
dling with the Compensation Army.
. The Chromed Accountant
. ConsOps may be history, but many of the ERLA agents the
CIA "borrowed" are still active players in the Game. Most of
them have been reassigned across the continent, to keep
them dispersed. Quite a few have been seconded to the DSI.
which uses them to keep tabs on insurgents and militia groups
in the NAN and Texas.

The Information Secretariat
Headquarters: Corvalis, Tir Tairngire
Operations Director: Prince Jonathon Reed
The Information Secretariat is Tir Tairngire's intelligence
agency. Unlike most agencies, which usually form to support
military operations, the IS grew as an extension of the Tir's
police force, the Constabulary Division, as its "secret police"
arm (with all the powers and dirty tricks that phrase conjures
up). Over time, the IS grew in size and eventually graduated to
a full-fledged spy agency.
. Spavin isn't kidding around. The Council of Princes generally
regards great dragons as potential threats, and the IS dedi-
cates a lot of effort toward keeping track of them all. Right now
the two North American greats-Hestaby and Ghostwalker-
are giving the IS the most fits. Especially Hestaby, with her now
on the Council.
· Spes
· Over the past year the Information Secretariat has been plant-
ing more operatives in California's Northern Crescent. They've
been canvassing entire regions with scads of listening posts, and
they've also been trying to insert deep cover agents into the
gypsy bands roaming the Crescent. According to the official
story being circulated in the Star Chamber and the Princes'
Council, the agents are there to keep an eye on Saito, but I think
that's a cover for the real reason: digging up more dirt on
Hestaby. Since she's on the Council, Prince Reed has to be care-
ful about what he says in his reports, official and otherwise.
· Magnificent Edward
Within the intelligence community, the Information
Secretariat is particularly well regarded for integrating magic in
intelligence operations, particularly with covert operatives and
deep-cover agents. The IS uses a lot of adepts, with favor
shown to those following the invisible way or the speaker's
way (the so-called social adepts). Some also speculate the
Secretariat has enlisted the services of a free spirit (known only
as Eidolon), but a lot of spooks are pretty skeptical.
. Eidolon's no spirit. I've met her (I won't say how or why). She's
Just an adept and a very good operative,

· Lara
Right now, the biggest item on the Information
Secretariat's agenda (next to Hestaby, that is) is the Rinelle
ke'Tesrae rebellion. As government efforts to suppress Rinelle
have been largely unsuccessful, the IS has been shifting its tac-
tics toward long-term infiltration, inserting deep-cover and
double agents over time, to improve their chances of penetrat-
ing the Rinelle leadership. To do this, they've had to persuade
the Peace Force to ease up its pressure on the group. (That's no
small feat, persuading General Gardener to change her mind.)
This has been going on for the better part of last year, so the IS
hopes that by now their agents may have burrowed deeply into
the cell organizational structure.
· The infiltration effort hasn't been entirely successful. In one
particularly gruesome case, the Rinelle members outed the IS
mole and sent her eyes, ears and tongue back to Corvalis as a
warning.
· Zora
. That took place early in the year. I haven't heard of a lot of
"examples being made" recently, but that could go either way.
Either the IS has backed off, or the moles are burrowing deeper.
· Aegis
Recently, a number of observers have noticed a lot of
internal activity roiling the Information Secretariat. Most
believe IS counterintelligence uncovered a number of Rinelle
moles in the agency. Though no one's said as much, judging by
the activity I'd guess at least one of these moles is highly
placed within the organization, perhaps even in a senior lead-
ership position. That's just my hunch, so if any of you have
more information for or against, post away.
· Oh, it's a senior position, all right. From what I heard, the high-
ly placed Rinelle mole is none other than Prince Jonathon
Reed!

popped up. No one on the Council, however, wants to investi-
gate. Reed has the High Prince's full confidence, and most of

the others are too afraid to challenge either Surehand or Reed.
The bigger question is, if Reed is involved with Rinelle, how
deep? It wouldn't be implausible to think Reed holds some key
leadership position, but I doubt he's running the show.

MI-5
Headquarters: Thames House, London, England (UK)
Director General of the Security Service: Dame Elise Cole
MI-5, officially known as the Security Service, is Britain's
domestic intelligence service. Originally formed under the
Home Office prior to World War I for counter-espionage
against German naval spies, MI-5 has evolved into one of the
best counterintelligence agencies in the world. Though nomi-
nally still part of the Home Office for administrative purposes,
it reports to the Oversight Board.
· A lot of rivalry exists between MI-5 and MI-6, the foreign intel-
ligence agency. Both jealously guard their jurisdictions; for
example, if a counterintelligence operation ever leaves British
soil (including territories like Barbados), MI-6 is quick to demand
that "Five" transfer the case to them. More than a few times,
the two agencies have hired runners to continue intelligence
operations outside of each agency's jurisdiction without their
counterparts' knowledge.
· Streak
In addition to counterintelligence, MI-5 also gathers intel-
ligence on internal groups posing a threat to the government.
The current unrest going on with the mysterious agent provo-
cateur called Pendragon and the burgeoning social movement
has kept MI-5 particularly busy.
Part of the problem is the eclectic nature of the factions
comprising the movement. Well over several dozen factions
exist, ranging from moderate to ultra-extreme, driven by dif-
ferent motives: neo-anarchism, feminism, eco-activists, anti-
corpers and so on. There seems to be no unifying theme other
than dissatisfaction with the government, and even that is
weak; some want simple reforms, others want wholesale rev-
olution. Classic counter-insurgent theory maintains that the
movement should have collapsed already, overwhelmed by
infighting. The movement is actually growing, however, and
becoming even more coordinated.
And then there's Pendragon himself. To even a junior
agent fresh out of the academy, it seems like a foregone con-
clusion that he and the movement are linked-there's even a
faction of the movement calling itself the Pendragon
Underground. But if they are, Pendragon seems to have no
interest in rallying his troops. He's never seen with them, and
on several occasions he actually refused to meet with some of
the movement organizers.
· Our King need not communicate with us. Simply seeing and
hearing him is enough to bring us all together.
· Crier
. Uh ... yeah. It's just his smile and pleasant demeanor that
keeps the movement together. This is that odd British sense of
humor, right?
· Skeptic

we've been hearing about lately? I know, it sounds like a
copout, pinning it all on magic, but it seems to be the only the-
ory that makes sense.

MIFD
Headquarters: Osaka, Japan
Director: Ichiro Kyomoto
Ah, the good old Market Information and Forecasting
Department. I gave some of the best years of my life and most
of my soul to those Shiawase bloodsuckers. So it's only fair if I
air some of their dirty laundry in public.
As the name implies, the MIFD officially serves as
Shiawase's marketing division, apparently gathering informa-
tion to forecast market trends and consumer demographics.
Under the surface, MIFD spies on everyone and everything that
has even the remotest relevance to Shiawase's businesses,
especially when it comes to industrial espionage.
. The MIFD places a tremendous amount of importance on
street buzz. On occasion they've been known to hire runners to
tail fixers and Johnsons, even those not directly involved with
Shiawase at the moment. They believe forewarned is fore-
armed, especially when it comes to street action.
· TacFire
Within the intelligence community, MIFD stands out for its
expertise in Matrix intelligence. The agency owns several hosts
dedicated expressly to collecting, indexing and analyzing the
terapulses of data the department collects. These rely a lot on
pattern-detection algorithms and sophisticated proto-Al know-
bots, and a lot of that expertise has spilled over into other
areas: applied cryptography, chaos theory and so on.
They've also taken a keen interest in developments in arti-
ficial intelligence and the otaku. During the whole mess with
the Renraku Arcology in Seattle, the MIFD brought in dozens of
experts to watch and take notes. Their interest has brought
some unwanted attention, though, particularly by Deus's fol-
lowers. Last month a bunch of otaku broke into the MIT&T
campus and kidnapped Hitomi Shiawase, the daughter of CEO
Tadashi Shiawase. The FBI tracked down the otaku and rescued
Hitomi twelve hours later, but daddy went through the roof
when he heard the news. Since then, MIFD agents have been
coming to Cambridge in droves to keep an eye on Hitomi and
track down the tribe responsible for abducting her.
. Geez, Spavin, don't you know anything? Hitomi Shiawase is
an otaku. I don't know exactly how it happened, though it
had something to do with the Matrix glitch in Seattle a few

The Seraphim
Headquarters: L'Assomption, Quebec
Chief Executive Director: Antoine Carsieur
The Seraphim, the intelligence branch of Cross Applied
Technologies, is one of the best-known corporate intelligence
agencies, at least to the public. Next to the MIFD of
Shiawase, the Seraphim are one of the most advanced cor-
porate intelligence agencies, on par with or even surpass-
ing some government agencies.
Officially (according to annual securities reports filed in
Quebec), the Seraphim are a special consulting services
division, and they do actually perform some legitimate ser-
vices, such as bodyguarding, security consultation, infor-
mation analysis and threat management. However, the rev-
enue generated from these legitimate ops is small potatoes
when compared to the illegitimate work they've undertak-
en for outside clients. When Lucien Cross was first getting
his company started, he organized the Seraphim as shad-
owrunners on retainer, contracting them out to various
Johnsons and taking a cut from their pay.
. The Seraphim still perform this "angels for hire" service,
though in a much smaller capacity than they used to. (They
need most of their agents for "in-house" projects.) The
Seraphim have a team in place in most major shadow
sprawls, including Seattle, Hong Kong, Frankfurt,
Constantinople and Vladivostok. These teams are free to
work for anyone (even Ares!), as long as they don't take a
run against Cross without clearing it first. Of course, the
retainer teams provide a major intelligence service to Cross
as well, by keeping their ears open to shadow chatter and
the word on the street.
· Fallen Angel
· If you're in Europe, watch out for a runner team called Équipe
Triade, a three-person group based out of Switzerland. The trio
is one of the best runner groups in Europe and has even land-
ed missions in North America. Two of the three-Nicole
Vertogne and Giovanni diSmarro-are ex-Seraphim, so it's a
good bet they're angels-for-hire.
· Force Majeure
Unlike many other intelligence agencies that organize
their departments based on region or assignment, the
Seraphim organize based on function and priority. Operatives
are categorized from H1 to H10, while assignments range from
C1 to C9. (I've attached a little table that summarizes this pret-
ty well.) You may notice that I've left the H10 category blank; I
have no idea what they do, nor do a lot of other folks I know
in the intel community. Some think these agents answer only
to Lucien Cross. A few wackos actually believe that Mr. Cross
alone is H10, or that H10 refers to Lucien Cross body doubles.
(Don't take my word; I'm just repeating what others have said.)
o I've heard H10 refers to the inner council that actually runs
the Seraphim. Antoine Carsieur, the Seraphim's chief executive
director, is just a public figurehead who takes his marching
orders from the H10. Nobody knows who they are exactly, but
they're referred to by Biblical names and imagery: "Gabriel,"
"Cardinal," "Angelique" and so on. They're involved in some

sort of strange mysticism and hold some interesting philoso-
phies, though I couldn't tell you what their core beliefs are.
· Kon Kan
. Another amateur fooled by smoke and mirrors. Don't believe
the Bible imagery for one second, chummers. It's a well-estab-
lished fact in intelligence circles that code names have zero
relevance to the mission or operative they're assigned to. This
keeps the brainiacs from trying to figure out the mission's true
purpose. In fact, if you do hear of a Seraphim agent or opera-
tion with some Biblical name attached, chances are it's disin-
formation CrossCorp is using to deceive its enemies.
· Ritter
. Generally true, but I wouldn't dismiss the "Gabriel" rumor too
quickly. I've heard the name mentioned too many times by reli-
able sources to dismiss it as a Seraphim deception. Kon Kan is
right that Carsieur is mostly an administrative figurehead, with
someone else calling the shots behind the scenes. The only sure
thing is that Gabriel is not Lucien Cross, but he (or she) is a very
close associate of the good doctor.
· Spavin
. It's probably worth pointing out that in Judeo-Christian-
Islamic mythology, Gabriel is the messenger of God and the
number two archangel, behind Michael. If this behind-the-
scenes head Seraphim chooses to call himself (or herself)
Gabriel, then it begs the question: is there a "Michael" in
CrossCorp, and what does he (or she) do?
· Bartholomew
For the past few years the Seraphim had been preoccupied
with internal matters, following the arrival of Nicholas Aurelius
and his loyalists from Ares. Quite a few high-level Seraphim,
thinking they knew what was best for the company, saw
Aurelius as a threat and took it upon themselves to keep a
watchful eye on him and his followers. Last year several H9
operatives ordered an unsanctioned C9 assassination attempt
against Aurelius, who survived thanks to some independent
runners he had on retainer.
When Lucien Cross found out, he was furious. (They said
you could hear his screaming as far away as Ottawa.) Cross fired
the then-chief director (literally, according to some) and
replaced him with Antoine Carsieur, whom he ordered to initi-
ate a massive inquisition) within Seraphim ranks. Most of the
bloodletting is done now, but I still think a few surviving "Fallen"
(as the rogues have been called) have gone into hiding.
. That's because Gabriel was behind the attempt. Lucien was
so pissed that Gabriel had no choice but to let the purge run its
course. So she protected the key organizers from exposure, bid-
ing time until the opportunity presents itself to try again.
· Dominic
With most of the Seraphim's attention turned inward dur-
ing the past few years, the aency has lost a lot of ground in
external operations. Ares, for example, found out about the
purge and used the distraction to uproot many Seraphim infil-
trators within its own ranks. CrossCorp's attempt to expand its
presence in Russia has similarly stalled, as many needed
Seraphim agents got caught up in the intrigue and deprived
Cross of the ability to outmaneuver Zeta-ImpChem and the
Russian Orthodox Church. It's likely CrossCorp will be spend-
ing the next two years catching up.
The Watchers
Even though Dunkelzahn's been dead and buried (well,
dead) these seven years, I have to give a nod to his spy orga-
nization, a loose informal group known simply as the Watchers.
Not only was the wyrm abreast of current events, in many
cases the Watchers kept him several steps ahead. Of course, it
helps having a wizwyrm mastermind the organization, but
without the Watchers there's no way the Big D could still be
manipulating events from the Beyond.
Dunkelzahn ran his organization similar to the classic cell
setup. The dragon was at the top, and communicated to a
small group of people he knew. Each individual in that group
knew their own set of people, and each individual in the sec-
ond tier knew their own set of people. And so on and so on,
down to the lowest level: the shadowrunners doing the actual
grunt work.
A couple of things, however, set the Watchers apart from the
rest. First, Dunkelzahn divided his people into two categories: fix-
ers, who hired runners to do things, and watchers, people on the
lookout for information. Most of us know about fixers already
from our shadow work; they weren't too much different in
Dunkelzahn's organization. Watchers were something else; they
watch, but they don't act. Sure, on occasion, a watcher might hire
runners to break into somewhere and find out something, but
that was it: no extractions, no sabotage, no wetwork.
. This isn't much different from the way established spy agen-
cies run. They divide their spooks into two categories as well:
Intelligence, desk-bound analysts who sift through the raw data
and figure out what it all means, and Operations, the field
agents who go out and do the grunt work. The only difference
is that in Dunkelzahn's case, everyone was in the field, so he
had to make a distinction to keep the pure information-gath-
erers separate from the black ops folks.
· Agent 99
To keep his organization from being compromised by out-
siders (mostly the other dragons), Dunkelzahn relied on one
primary strategy: misdirection. For one thing, his public image
as a media celebrity lulled most of us into complacency. Behind
the scenes, however, Dunkelzahn communicated with his first
tier through out-of-the-way channels where no one would
think to look: Mason City, lowa; Enid, Oklahoma; Walldürn,
Württemburg; Hainan, China; and many others.

After Dunkelzahn died, his organization eventually crum-
bled. It took a lot longer than one would expect, but without
the dragon to keep them in line, the end was inevitable. The
Draco Foundation absorbed large chunks of the Watchers, par-
ticularly those operating in the Americas and Europe. When
Ghostwalker showed up a couple of years ago, he co-opted a
lot of Watcher cells as well. (If I were to guess, I'd say the DF
and Ghostwalker each absorbed about a third of the Watchers;
the remaining third I'm guessing went independent or chose
to work for other players.)
· Ghostwalker's been making a hard push to round up as many
holdouts as he can. After Dunkelzahn died, most went into hid-
ing, to avoid being scooped up by the other dragons, but
apparently Ghostwalker knew how to contact many of them. I
think he may have tipped his hand recently, however, and
some of the other dragons-particularly Lofwyr, Aden and
Celedyr-are trying to snatch the remaining Watchers up
before Ghostwalker gets them.
· Southern Cross
THE GAME BOARD
The Game is played everywhere around the world, but
some places attract spies more than others. National capitals
and intelligence headquarters are obvious examples. Here are
some other places that have seen a lot of intelligence activity.
Austin
A lot of spies were disappointed when Ghostwalker
kicked the Azzies out of Denver. With six national jurisdictions
inside city limits, Denver used to be an espionage haven, par-
ticularly for NAN, CAS and UCAS agencies getting a peek into
Aztlan. But when Ghostwalker told the Azzies to shoo, so did
a good chunk of the interest.
. There's still plenty of spying going on in Denver, though. The
Sioux and the UCAS carry on their border posturing here, and
the CAS loves playing nosy neighbor. And since the Azzies are
itching for a little bit of payback, they'll pay well for any dirt
they can dig up on Ghostwalker, not to mention the Pueblo
and CAS (since the Azzies would have to go through them to
get to the dragon, after all.)

in name), straddling the Colorado River that also divides Aztlan
and the CAS. Besides the two neighbors, other countries with
agents in Austin include the UCAS, Pueblo Corporate Council
and the Sioux (spying on behalf of the Sovereign Tribal
Council). Pueblo and UCAS base their operations from the
Confederation side of the city, but the Sioux base theirs out of
their consulate on the Aztlan side.
· The University of Texas, which sits on the CAS side of the city.
has become a hotbed of espionage activity. Lots of UCAS and
Pueblo agents have come to UT posing as students or visiting
faculty. Most of the time, they're trying to make contact with
spies on the Aztlan side of Austin. The CIA has also inserted
agents at UT to keep an eye on the CAS and report activity
along the CAS-Aztlan border.
· TJ
· On the Aztlan side of the city, Zilker Park has become a pop-
ular gathering place. The park sits on the river, and it's easy to
get ashore from the CAS side. Rather than try to keep the spies
out, the Azzies have loosened up security around the park and
put up hundreds of listening posts in the immediate vicinity.
They figure the spies are going to get in anyway, so why not
channel them to a place where they can keep tabs real easy?

Beirut
It's hard to say if history will repeat itself yet again. After
Lebanese President Elias Khouri died in a suspicious car acci-
dent. Prime Minister Abdul Karami "invited" Syrian peace-
keepers into the country, setting off waves of protest and
resentment among Christian and Shi'ite minorities. Things got
even hairier with the death and apparent resurrection of Ibn
Eisa, a friend to both Karami and the Syrians. When it looked
like the Israelis were making moves to invade again, I'm pret-
ty sure the UCAS ambassador twitched every time a truck
passed by the embassy.
· Not funny.
· Ollie
Well, it's been three years since the trouble began, and
everyone in Beirut is getting tired of wondering when the other
shoe will drop. Things aren't getting better, but they're not get-
ting worse, either. It's hard to tell which way things will go.
which I suppose explains why there's so much intelligence
activity at the moment. For Mossad, Beirut is just a hop and a
skip from Tel Aviv, which makes it a convenient backdoor into
Arabia. The IUM and NIJ probably see it the same way, only
going in the other direction. And while a lot of businesses have
fled Lebanon because of the unrest, it's still the primary Arab
shipping port into the Middle East, so none of the Big Ten or
even the Eurocorps are going to close up shop any time soon.
I hear even Argus and 10K Daggers have come to town, to see
which way the winds are blowing and who's got the most reli-
able merc contracts.
· The growing split between the IUM and NIJ has put a strain
between Karami and his Syrian handlers. Karami believes in the
IUM philosophy and just wants to see Lebanon Integrated into
a new unified pan-Islamic state. Many of the Syrian occupiers,
however, are turning toward the NIJ and want to see Lebanon
cleansed of its "infidels," en route to a full-scale invasion of
Israel.
· Levantine Son
. Lost in the background amid all the questions about the IUM,
NIJ, Ibn Eisa and Israel is a running shadow war between the
pawns of Lofwyr and Aden. Saeder-Krupp maintains many
offices here to manage oil production and political payoffs. By
the same token, Aden also has many followers, particularly
among the dissident Christians and Armenians living in
Lebanon and Israel. For the two dragons, Beirut is the setting for
a shadowy game of chess, as pawns of each move against
each other.
· Wyrm Watcher
Brussels
The rise of the NEEC put Brussels back on the map as the
administrative center of Europe. This in turn has resulted in a
flurry of intelligence activity. Many countries and Eurocorps
that were bitter rivals only a few years ago are now partners,
but old suspicions die hard. Consequently, the close proximi-
ty of each other's VIPs and apparatchiks is too tempting to
pass up.
. Here's a perfect example: HKB and Transys Neuronet. There's
certainly no love lost between the two ever since Celedyr boot-
ed HKB out of the catbird seat on Transys' board of directors.
HKB is a full-fledged member of the NEEC, however, while
Transys' membership is pending approval. So in Brussels, Transys
has to play a little bit nicer than usual until they get admitted to
the club. Of course, that just means their black ops plunge
deeper into the shadows than usual.
· Money Man
Of course, the establishment of the New European
Economic Community has also attracted a fair share of inter-
ested onlookers. Both the UCAS and the CAS have a lot of
political and economic ties to the Old World, so the CIA, DSI
and ERLA all have a vested interest in maintaining stations in
Brussels. The same can also be said of the Corporate Court,
which has hired independents like Argus and Aegis Cognito to
keep a finger on Brussels' pulse.
· Dunkelzahn's old Watcher network has also seen a lot of
activity around Brussels lately. When Dunkelzahn was alive, his
agents in the area often routed information through Namur,
which isn't too far from Brussels. After Dunkelzahn died, most of

his Watchers in this area got co-opted by the Draco
Foundation, but some of them recently swore allegiance to
Ghostwalker. Both have a vested interest in keeping a watchful
eye on Lofwyr and how he might manipulate the NEEC through
Saeder-Krupp.

Geneva
Geneva is the so-called crossroads of Europe. Being rela-
tively reachable to all of Western Europe's major cities, Geneva
is home to many international organizations: the UN, the Red
Cross, the International Standards Organization (ISO) and plen-
ty of others. With all these non-corporate entities in one place,
is it any surprise the megacorps keep tabs on the area? The
MIFD maintains a major office in Geneva, and you'll find more
Seraphim from Cross prowling here than in any other place
outside of Quebec.
· A lot of major policlubs like Humanis also have a significant
presence in Geneva, most of them within a stone's throw of UN
headquarters. As almost all of them have some axe to grind
against either a certain nation or megacorp, their Geneva
offices become regular targets of espionage and infiltration.
· Poolitzer
Hainan
Once part of the People's Republic of China, Hainan is a
large island some 400 kilometers southwest of Hong Kong in
the South China Sea. Its balmy tropical breezes and lush beau-
ty spots make it a prime vacation getaway. Most visitors come
from the Canton Confederation and Hong Kong, but all kinds of
Asians make the trip to Hainan, even from as far away as Korea
and Singapore.
After the communists collapsed in 2018, local Hainan
leaders found themselves in a precarious position. Hainan pos-
sessed significant ethnic Chinese minorities, and it also held a
key strategic position between the Gulf of Tonkin and the South
China Sea. If civil war and ethnic cleansing didn't consume
Hainan, then it risked a takeover by Vietnam, the emerging
Canton Confederation or even Imperial Japan.
To this day, no one's entirely sure what backroom deals
the Hainan government cut, but the results became obvious
quickly. Weeks after the communists' collapse, the Hainan
island government staged a news conference in the central city
square. The government declared strict neutrality for the island
of Hainan; furthermore, Hainan would be a military-free zone,
with no armed forces allowed within its territorial waters.
Anyone attempting to violate this, the governor warned,
would face "the wrath of the heavenly regents." Suddenly on
cue, a large white Oriental dragon (later introduced as Bai
Zhenzhu, a female adult dragon) descended out of the clouds
and landed behind the stage, glaring at the assembled cameras
and reporters.
Ever since then, the nations in the region have respected
Hainan's neutrality, under threat of draconic retribution (sup-
plemented by Hainan's own small but capable militia). Under
the treaty, no armed vessel may enter Hainan's territorial
waters, but anyone regardless of ethnicity or race is welcome
to enter and leave freely. Without fear of invasion, Hainan con-
tinues to thrive as a vacation resort, especially one serving as
residence for a dragon.
. I know dragons are powerful, but aren't we overstating the
case a little bit? A full squadron of fighters could take down a
single dragon, though it may sustain some heavy casualties.
And once the dragon is down, any task force could overwhelm
the island militia.
· Skeptic
. Maybe you should get out of North America once in a while
and see how the real world operates, Skeptic. A sufficiently
concentrated force could overcome Bai Zhenzhu and the mili-
tia, but the reality is that most of Hainan's neighbors don't have
that kind of force. The strongest would be the Canton
Confederation, and if we did that, both Sichuan and Taiwan
would be on our backs like white on rice.
. Lo Fu Chee
. Besides, if anyone were so stupid as to try to wipe out Bai
Zhenzhu, then Lung, Ryumyo and all the other dragons in the
Far East would burninate them in retaliation. The dragons of
the East may not get along, but they'll cooperate enough
against a mutual threat-like uppity Asian warlords who don't
know their place.
· Wyrm Watcher
· Rumors have gone around ever since Hainan went indepen-
dent that they had another card up their sleeve: nuclear
weapons. At that time, the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) suspected Hainan had acquired a Type 94 Qin-
class Chinese missile sub, but they could never prove it.
· Hans
Despite (or because of) Hainan's military-free zone, the
island has become a hotbed of international espionage and
intrigue. Hainan holds a commanding position over the South
China Sea lanes, so many intelligence agencies maintain covert
listening posts monitoring communications and maritime traffic.
Because no one wants to risk Bai Zhenzhu's wrath, the various
spy cells in Hainan have maintained a gentleman's agreement
not to frag with each other on the island. So long as they're will-
ing to keep the peace, Hainan turns a blind eye to them.
. On the other hand, shadowrunners are denlable assets, so
there's plenty of work available for covert runs to intercept or
manipulate spy data before it reaches its destination. Just be
quiet, or you could end up as dragon poop.
. HK Kid
As far as Bai Zhenzhu herself, she keeps a low profile.
Apart from that initial press conference, the dragon has had lit-
tle contact with the island government and lets them run

things as they please. Most of the time Bai Zhenzhu stays
inside her huge dragon-sized villa, which she maintains in the
island's interior. She sees few guests, but the ones she does see
are very interesting. Most prominent figures in Southeast Asia
have come calling at one time or another, but her most fre-
quent and well known visitors are the other great wyrms of
Asia: Lung and Ryumyo. On several occasions, Bai Zhenzhu
has hosted them both together, where they drink tea, play Go
and Mah-Jongg and have conversations I'm sure others would
kill to overhear. Recently, the great dragon Masaru has started
attending these get-togethers with his elders.
. There's more to the story than what's being let on. An adult
dragon on sociable terms with the most powerful dragons in
the Far East, both of whom hate each other, must have some-
thing on them.
· DragonIX
0 | hear that Bai Zhenzhu was an agent of none other than
Dunkelzahn. Apparently Dunkelzahn assigned her to act as an
arbitress between Lung and Ryumyo, and one of the reasons
she went to Hainan is because the yin and yang of the dragon
lines are naturally balanced on the island.

Zhenzhu last month. Ever since Ghostwalker set himself up in
Denver, he's been appropriating some of Dunkelzahn's
Watchers for his own use. Curiouser and curiouser.

Seattle
Much as I hate to stroke the ego of you Shadowlanders,
I'd be amiss to overlook Seattle's role in the Great Game. As
a UCAS city in the middle of the NAN, on the edge of the
Pacific and around the corner from Tir Tairngire, Seattle is the
ultimate intelligence hotspot. The CIA, DSI, UGB, Information
Secretariat, Imperial Military Intelligence and many other
agencies all have a lot of resources tied up in Seattle, watch-
ing the various people coming in and going out, in addition
to each other.
· The Information Secretariat has been pouring a lot of assets
into Seattle since the problems with Rinelle ke'Tesrae started.
Back in the old days, the Tir Council of Princes used to dump
their dissidents here until they realized that once the dissenters
were out of the Tir, the princes had a lot less control over the
exiles. While many dissidents know they're not far enough away
to be untouchable, a lot offer covert assistance to Rinelle in the
form of money, materiel and information. The IS can't let that
happen, so they've been assigning agents up here to intercept
the pipeline and identify (and eliminate) outside supporters.
· Smiley
With the status of the arcology still undecided, a lot of
agencies have had a field day picking away at the carcass to
gain more information about Deus, what it was up to and
whether or not it's really gone, as Renraku claims. They've also
been trying to pick up leads on the surviving otaku and
Banded, since it's possible that some or all of them could
regroup elsewhere.
· Of course Deus isn't dead. Renraku managed to break his
power base and reclaim the arcology, which in PR terms is the
same as a win. But they didn't catch all (or even most) of his
otaku followers, who've now scattered across the globe and
are carrying out his plans elsewhere.
. Arclight
. I'm beginning to believe Arclight may be right. Overwatch
has been getting reports that many of Deus' Banded are con-
gregating elsewhere: Kuala Lumpur, Tallinn, Albuquerque and
many other places. It's clear Deus had a plan in case of his
demise. But what is that plan? We haven't figured that out-
and frankly, that scares me.

GAME INFORMATION
This section provides game information and rules for using
the material presented in Games of State. Included in this sec-
tion are rules and statistics for new equipment, along with
information and suggestions for gamemasters interested in
running a Shadowrun espionage campaign.
RUNNING AN ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN
In many regards, an espionage campaign isn't much dif-
ferent from a regular shadowrunner campaign. Like shad-
owrunners, intelligence operatives are deniable assets per-
forming dirty deeds on behalf of their agency. One can even
argue that shadowrunners are nothing more than freelance
covert operatives working for the highest bidder.
Because most people associate espionage and intelligence
with secret government agencies, an intelligence campaign fre-
quently revolves around characters employed by an organiza-
tion like the CIA, UGB or Mossad. Player characters may alter-
nately be spying on behalf of a megacorporate agency (MIFD,
the Seraphim, Saeder-Krupp Prime), an independent agency
(Aegis Cognito, Argus) or even a great dragon (the Watchers)!
Though intelligence agencies perform their share of dirty
work such as assassination and sabotage, the large majority
of missions revolve around information: finding out what's
going on and who knows about it. Agencies already have
established networks in place for gathering routine informa-
tion, so it's assumed the player characters are special opera-
tives called upon for unusual situations. For example, the
agency may receive information on a project they're particu-
Jarly interested in and ask the player characters to find out
more. Similarly, the agency may notice an anomaly in routine
State of the Art: 2064

NOVATECH
=
intelligence reports and send the characters in to figure out
just what's going on. (In the latter scenario, as the characters
are already in place, the agency may then assign the charac-
ters to do something about it.)
Requisitioning Gear
As employees of the agency, the player characters auto-
matically receive the necessary equipment to do the job, with-
in limits. Agencies have finite budgets, after all, and can't cater
to all of their agents' whims, no matter how good the opera-
tives are. So if the characters want a Thor shot on call, they'd
better have a damn good reason for it.
During character creation, players of agent characters may
opt to set aside up to half of their nuyen from Resources into a
Budget Pool. They can then use the Budget Pool to requisition
mission-specific gear from the agency as called for during a
specific mission. Players may combine multiple Budget Pools
to form one large pool for high-priced items, like vehicles or
special gadgets. During character advancement, players may
use Good Karma to increase their characters' Budget Pools, at
a rate of 1,000¥ per point of Good Karma spent. Players should
not spend more than half the Good Karma earned in a single
adventure toward increasing their Budget Pool.
Whenever characters wish to requisition gear for a mis-
sion, the gamemaster should first check if the Budget Pool (or
combined Budget Pools) is adequate to cover the cost. If so,
make an Availability Test using the character's Etiquette skill
against the Availability target number, as if the character were
trying to obtain the gear off the street (see Availability, p. 272,
SR3). Deduct the base cost from the available Budget Pool;
don't worry about Street Index or negotiations (haggling with
your boss is not a good way to advance your intelligence
career, after all).
Satellite Imagery
Agent characters working for certain major spy agencies
like the CIA or the UGB may occasionally gain access to satel-
lite imagery. If it's central to the mission, the agency will make
any necessary arrangements. On the other hand, if it's not
absolutely urgent, the characters will have to convince their
superiors otherwise. Make a Negotiation Test and apply a +2
Annoying to NPC modifier (p. 94, SR3). If the character wins,
his superior has agreed to check for availability.
Ordinary shadowrunners may also gain access to satellite
imagery from time to time. If it's vital to ensuring successful
completion of the shadowrun, Mr. Johnson will make any nec-

essary arrangements to set it up with the characters, albeit on
his client's terms. If it's not central to the shadowrun, howev-
er, the runners will have to hit up on their contacts. In this case,
the character must have the Friends in High Places Edge (p. 27,
SRComp), and the contact should be at least Level 2. As with
agent characters, make a Negotiation Test, but apply a +4
Harmful to NPC modifier (wasting a million-nuyen asset for an
outsider could get the contact fired, after all).
Even if the characters get access to satellite imagery,
there's no guarantee that a satellite will be overhead at the
time they want it. Consult the Satellite Imagery Availability
Table and look up the Coverage Rating, based on the sponsor-
ing agency and the type of satellite desired. Roll a number of
dice equal to the Coverage Rating against a base target num-
ber of 5; apply modifiers as appropriate. If the test is success-
ful, a satellite is available over the area covered. Roll randomly
to determine the setup and scan times, as listed for each
agency. (At the gamemaster's option, extra successes on the
Coverage Test may be used to adjust the dice results up or
down, as desired. Each extra success alters the result by ±1.)
While scanning via satellite, characters make Perception
Tests as normal to notice any significant details. Apply modi-
fiers per the Satellite Perception Test Modifiers Table. The Level
of Detail table indicates the type of information that can be
gleaned from each type of satellite scan.
NEW EDGES AND FLAWS
The following edges and flaws may be helpful to player
characters, either covert operatives in an intelligence campaign
or ordinary shadowrunners performing intelligence-related
shadowruns.
Diplomatic Immunity (Social Edge)
Value: 2
Characters with the Diplomatic Immunity Edge are under
diplomatic protection from a host country or extraterritorial
corporation. (This edge includes certain extranational entities
such as the UN and the Corporate Court, as appropriate.) A
character with diplomatic immunity may not be arrested,
charged with or convicted of a felony or misdemeanor while
abroad in another country (including corporate extraterritorial
property) that recognizes the sponsoring entity. The character
also may not be searched without his permission. The charac-
ter may be expelled from the country, however, as persona non
grata, and if immunity is revoked, cannot set foot outside the
host country's embassy or other extraterritorial property.
Diplomatic immunity does not give a character carte
blanche to openly commit crimes. The home sponsor can with-
draw diplomatic immunity if the character becomes an embar-
rassment or diplomatic risk. A character may also be temporar-
ily detained for questioning while law enforcement checks his
diplomatic credentials. Furthermore, a character with diplo-
matic immunity is still subject to the home sponsor's legal sys-
tem and can be prosecuted under those laws or extradited, if
the sponsor so chooses.
To have diplomatic immunity, the character must possess
a SIN under the host sponsor's identification system. This
means the character's identity can be tracked and logged.
Additionally, the host sponsor will have conducted an exten-
sive background check on the character, so they may know
more about the character than the character does himself.
Dossier on File (Social Flaw)
Value: - 4
Characters with this flaw have an extensive profile stored
in a government or corporate intelligence database. This
dossier is more extensive than a simple SIN; in most cases a
SIN is simply an index number that links to various financial and
legal databases. A dossier not only contains the character's
identity, it also tracks all other cover identities and lifestyles the
character has used prior to acquiring the flaw; a relatively
recent and accurate holopic; a history of social contacts, depen-
dents, friends and enemies; and even a comprehensive bio-
graphical analysis, including relative strengths and weakness-
es. In some cases, the dossier may include things about the
character she herself does not know.
This flaw indicates only that someone has a detailed pro-
file on the character; it doesn't necessarily mean the character
is being hunted by an enemy. The large majority of covert
operatives, for example, have a dossier on file with the agency
that employs them. Similarly, an agency might keep a dossier
on file for prominent local shadowrunners, in case they need to
use them in the future.
Since a dossier contains a lot of sensitive information that
can be used against the character, there's always a chance an
adversary may access and read this dossier. Gamemasters
should reserve this event for major enemies with substantial
resources; lesser foes wouldn't have the means to break into
an intelligence host, and one-time antagonists aren't motivat-
ed enough to make the effort. If using the rules for enemies on
pp. 68-70 of the Shadowrun Companion, an enemy's
Knowledge rating automatically jumps to a minimum of 5,
which also lifts the enemy's overall rating accordingly. (In
almost all cases, this results in a +1 increase to the overall rat-
ing, so gamemasters should only use this if they deem the
raised hostility justified.)
Dossiers on file are almost impossible to modify or erase.
Given their sensitive data, agencies often keep multiple dupli-
cates online, guarded with the blackest of IC, with backups in
cold storage behind the most stringent security. Attempting to
erase a dossier on file should be the basis of a major adventure,
either as a shadowrun against the agency holding it or as a
massive favor to the agency in exchange for its destruction.
Incomplete Deprogramming (Mental Flaw)
Value: - 2
A character with Incomplete Deprogramming was once a
deep-cover agent for an agency, but after being extracted his
deprogramming was rushed, interrupted or suffered some unex-
pected glitch. Subsequently, residual traces of the cover identity
remain and may rise to the forefront during stressful situations.
Whenever this character faces a stressful situation (for
example, an interrogation, combat or injury), make a
Willpower (4) Test. If the character fails, the cover identity tem-

gamemaster and can last anywhere from a few minutes to a
few hours, whatever best suits the adventure.) During this

to re-exert control. When faced with another stressful situation,
make another Willpower (4) Test. If the character fails this time,
the real personality re-emerges. During a protracted fight, a
character may lapse and relapse several times throughout.
NEW SPELLS
The spells below were developed by intelligence magi-
cians to help them in covert ops. Ordinary magicians can learn
them only if they have the appropriate contacts in the right
intelligence agency.
Sound Barrier (Illusion)
Type: P . Target: 4 . Duration: S · Drain: +1 (M)
The Sound Barrier is similar to the Silence spell (p. 196, SR3),
but instead of creating a mass area of silence, it creates a perime-
ter of silence around the area of effect. Those inside cannot hear
outside noises but can hear sounds within the cone normally and
vice versa. Only sounds traveling across the border between
inside and outside are affected, in the same manner as the Silence
spell. This spell also affects infrasound and ultrasound.
Word Recognition (Detection)
Type: M · Target: W . Duration: S . Drain: (M)
Word Recognition is a limited form of Mind Probe that is
less intrusive. Rather than exposing the entire mind, Word
Recognition shoots a name, image or one-word concept into the
brain and gauges the target's reaction to it. The number of suc-
cesses determines the minimum level of familiarity detected.
To use this spell, the caster must cast it against a person
within line of sight. The subject will notice that the concept
being sent has risen to his attention for no apparent reason.
and may attempt to notice the spellcasting as normal.
Hainsley is an ERLA magician on a counterintel-
ligence case against two suspected Seraphim moles,
Tennant and Lowe. (He's half right; Tennant is a
Seraphim plant, while Lowe is clean). Hainsley does-
n't want to tip his hand and use Mind Probe, in the
hope that his investigations might uncover further
spies. Instead, he casts a Word Recognition spell as
he passes them in the hallway, using the name of a
known Seraphim intelligence officer as the key.
Hainsley makes a Sorcery Test against Tennant
and gains 2 successes. As the spell gently filters the
name through Tennant's mind, Hainsley picks up a
small flash of recognition. Tennant may be working
for the Seraphim officer, but then again, she could
simply have overheard the name elsewhere. It's not
solid, but it's enough to warrant further investigation.
Had Hainsley gotten more successes, he would have
discovered stronger signs of recognition that would
prove the link.
Hainsley makes another Sorcery Test against
Lowe and does better, getting 4 successes.
However, as Lowe has no association whatsoever
with the Seraphim officer, and has never even heard
the name, the result is no recognition. Hainsley feels
confident that Lowe isn't working for that Seraphim
officer-but that doesn't mean Lowe isn't working
for someone else ...
NEW EQUIPMENT
The gear listed below can often be found in the hands of
spies and covert operatives on intelligence missions.
Occasionally, some find their way into the shadows and may
be used by freelance snoops and assassins.

Disguising Equipment
Intelligence agencies often disguise special equipment as
everyday items to fool casual observers. Rather than list an infi-
nite array of disguised items, gamemasters may use these rules
for disguising equipment as an otherwise ordinary object.
Look up the equipment's Concealability and compare it to
the Concealability of Ordinary Items Table. Equipment may be
disguised as any ordinary item that has a Concealability less
than the equipment's. If the Concealability of the disguise is
greater than or equal to that of the equipment, the equip-
ment's Concealability has to be increased so that it exceeds
that of its disguise. Each +1 increase to Concealability increas-
es the item's cost by 50 percent. Concealability may not be
raised more than +3 above normal.
If more than one piece of equipment is to be disguised
within an ordinary object, the Concealability rating of all equip-
ment must be at least 2 greater than that of the object in which
they are concealed.
Because these kinds of equipment are specialty items
made exclusively for intelligence agencies, it's highly unlikely
shadowrunners will find them on the street. For purposes of
requisitioning a Budget Pool, they have an Availability Code of
8/96 hours (see Requisitioning Gear, p. 30).
Agent Midnight has been assigned to kidnap a
professor of magic who has information her superior
desires. Posing as a college student, Midnight
decides she needs a taser disguised as a student text-
book. When she gets close enough to the professor,
she will fire the taser and stun him, making it easy for
her to spirit him away to a safehouse.
Looking at the Equipment chapter of SR3, the
gamemaster notes that a Defiance Super Shock taser
has a Concealability of 4. The gamemaster then
checks on the Concealability of Ordinary Items Table
and determines that a college textbook should have
a Concealability of 6. To fit a taser into the textbook,
the taser's Concealability has to be at least 7. This is a
+3 increase to Concealability, so the price of the dis-
guised taser increases by 150 percent (2,500¥).
When carrying an item disguised as something else, the
base target number to spot the disguise is equal to the dis-
guise's Concealability plus 4. If the spotter gets 1 or more suc-
cesses, he spots the item as phony. Additional successes help
determine the true nature of the object. Disguised objects do
not fool chemsniffers, MAD detectors or other security scan-
ners that rely on input other than sight to function. If a device
that would not be fooled by the disguise scans the object, use
the item's normal Concealability Rating instead. (For example,
chemsniffers still pick up disguised chemicals or firearms, while
MAD detectors still detect disguised electronics.)
Agent Midnight is shadowing her professor
when she spies him walking through a magnetic
detector to get into a restricted area. If Midnight were
to walk through the magnetic detector with her dis-
guised taser, the Concealability Rating for the object
is 4, the original Concealability of the taser.
Listed below are some sample disguised objects that run-
ners may commonly encounter:
Ballpoint pen micro-transceiver: This device resembles a
fancy twist-top roller-ball pen, rather than the cheap throw-
aways sold in packs of ten at the local Stuffer Shack. It actually
consists of three devices: a Rating 1 micro-recorder, a Rating 1
micro-transceiver (capable of receiving transmitted signals
from a listening bug) and a digital memory core capable of
storing up to 500 Mp of data. The twist-top cap also contains
an imbedded wireless earpiece, so the user can listen in on
conversations through the transceiver. (The transceiver has a
Flux of 0, so maximum range is only 250 meters.)
Chemical Cosmetics: These look like ordinary cosmetic or
hygienic products, such as a makeup compact, lipstick,
cologne or deodorant (aerosol and roll-on). The "cosmetics,"
however, are actually gels laced with DMSO, mixed with a
pharmaceutical chemical of the agent's choice. The makeup
compact can hold three separate chemicals, with up to 10
doses. The lipstick, cologne and deodorant hold only a single
chemical, but contain many more doses (100 for the lipstick,
cologne and roll-on; 200 for the aerosol.)
Briefcase Rocket: This resembles an ordinary briefcase,
but it carries a nasty surprise: a single-shot high-explosive
rocket. To arm the rocket, the user lifts and twists the briefcase
handle 180 degrees. To fire the rocket, the user presses the
brass nameplate set underneath the handle. Use the same sta-
tistics as the M79B1 LAW rocket (p. 28, CC), but reduce all
ranges to half normal.

Hollowed Objects: Even in the
micro-digital world of Shadowrun, the
classic hardcover book with a hol-
lowed-out space between the pages
still plays an important role in
espionage. This group of objects
includes other classics such as
the false-bottom suitcase. As a
general rule the hollowed space
should be no greater than half the
normal volume of the object.
Special Weapons
Ares "Screech" Sonic Beam
Rifle: The Screech is the latest
development by Ares Arms, the
first non-lethal firearm for riot con-
trol use. When fired, the rifle pro-
jects a beam of intense high-fre-
quency sound that creates nausea and
disorientation in metahuman targets, ren-
dering them harmless until the effect wears off. The Screech
can operate in single target mode (for picking off instigators in
a crowd) and in a wide-beam "spray" mode capable of affect-
ing multiple targets.
In game terms, the Screech creates temporary Stun dam-
age that wears off over time. Targets hit by a sonic beam from
a Screech make their Damage Resistance Test using Willpower
instead of Body. Armor does not apply, but sound dampeners
do. Ordinary earplugs provide 3 points of "armor" protection,
while cyberear dampeners (p. 299, SR3) provide 4 points of
armor. A Silence spell (p. 196, SR3) or Sound Barrier spell (p.
35) provides armor protection equivalent to its Force. Stun
damage inflicted from a Screech wears off at a rate of 1 box per

Combat Turn. (Players should mark this damage differently, to
distinguish it from other types of Stun damage.)
A Screech may be fired in single-target and wide-beam
modes. When firing the Screech in wide-beam mode, use the
rules for shotgun spread (p. 117, SR3) to resolve dispersion
and power loss. The "choke" for the Screech can be set any-
where between 2 and 10. The Screech is powered by the
same hip-mounted battery pack used by the Ares MP Laser III
(p. 30, CC).
Characters use the Laser Weapons Skill when firing the
Screech. Use the Shotgun Range Table to determine range.
Cigarette Micro-rocket: The cigarette micro-rocket
appears like an ordinary nic-stick, but instead of tobacco it con-
tains a micro-sized rocket. To activate, the character lights the
cigarette as normal, which ignites a delayed action fuse. The
rocket launches a few moments later (long enough for the user
to take a drag and "aim" the rocket) at a target no further than
50 meters away. Two types of micro-rockets are available: a
fragmenting warhead effective against personnel and a high-
explosive warhead for minor material damage.

Firing a cigarette micro-rocket requires its own special
skill. Use the Hold-Out Range Table to determine range.
Cigarette micro-rockets may be obtained individually or in
packs. (A typical pack holds about 12 cigarettes.)
Clothing
Null Suit: A null suit is a thermally insulated bodysuit
designed to mask body heat, through a combination of cooling
microcapillaries and a photoelectric transformer that converts
infrared emissions from body heat into a higher bandwidth
beyond the range of most thermographic sensors. This tech-
nology renders the user undetectable not only by thermo-
graphic emissions, but also by motion sensors (which primarily
operate by measuring sudden changes in infrared radiation).
Characters wearing a null suit receive an additional +2
modifier when thermographic sensors or motion detectors are
trying to detect them. This +2 modifier also applies to the char-
acter's Signature, if vehicle sensors attempt to detect the char-
acter. On the downside, the suit is extremely bulky; reduce the
character's Combat Pool by 2. (If combining the null suit with
other forms of armor, use the Armor Layering rules on p. 285
of SR3, but treat the null suit as if it had an equivalent Ballistic
Armor Rating of 8.)
Gecko Tape Gloves:
Gecko tape gloves are
made of a special type
of dry adhesive called
gecko tape. Instead
of
sticky
glue,
gecko tape incor-
porates a surface
covered with mil-
lions of microscop-
ic hairs so fine that
intermolecular bond-
ing melds the surface
to
another
object.
Individually these bonding
forces are insignificant, but
when combined, they are strong
enough to stick a troll upside-down on a ceiling.
Gecko tape gloves come as a set that includes gloves,
kneepads and slip-on soles. When used during climbing, treat
the character as if he were performing assisted climbing, but
use the movement rate for unassisted climbing. (In other
words, apply the -10 assisted climbing modifier, but do not
reduce the climbing speed.)
One primary disadvantage of gecko tape is its extreme
susceptibility to water; it becomes useless if wet. If it ever gets
damp, its effects are cancelled out until it dries. (Heated air
generally destroys the surface, so the gloves must dry out at
ambient room temperature, a process that takes several hours.)
Vision Enhancers
Night
Vision
Contacts: Night vision
contacts consist of lay-
ered magneto-plasmic
gels
that amplify
incoming light, allow-
ing the user to see nor-
mally in the dark. The
technology
used is
similar to that in plas-
ma flat-screen televi-
sions, and the lenses
themselves recharge continually with every blink of the eye.
Treat characters wearing night vision contacts as if they
possessed cybernetic low-light vision enhancement. Night
vision contacts may be combined with other technological
devices (such as cybereyes or goggles) to further improve low-
light capability on par with natural racial vision, but it does not
enhance it any further. Night vision contacts may be used in
conjunction with spellcasting without violating line-of-sight.
On the downside, night vision contacts are very sensitive to
intense light and not very durable, compared to cybereyes or
goggles. If exposed to normal light levels for more than five min-
utes, night vision contacts burn themselves out and become use-
less. Also, if a flare or flash attack affects the character (such as
flash packs or the Flash spell), double the effectiveness of the
attack. (The flash attack also instantly burns out the contacts.)
Communications
Cellular Trigger: A cellular trigger is a specialized cellular
receiver. Whenever a user dials the trigger's number, the trig-
ger sends a signal to an electronic device, causing it to acti-
vate. For example, a cellular trigger can detonate a bomb
remotely, or it can order an activate-on-demand tracking sig-
nal to turn itself on. A cellular trigger is effective only in an area
that receives cellular telephone service; if it is taken outside of
cellular coverage, it cannot be activated.
RF Trackers: Radio-frequency detection systems, or RF
trackers, are highly sensitive transmission detectors that enable
an operator to pinpoint a transmission over long distances.

Most intelligence agencies employ portable versions to pro-
vide SIGINT support for local operations.
An RF tracker works in a similar manner as a radio scanner
(p. 289, SR3) and can monitor and scan radio frequencies in the
same way. An RF tracker, however, has the additional ability to
pinpoint a signal it has intercepted. (If an
RF tracker is scanning through a range of
frequencies, then it must make a
Scanner Rating Success Test, as specified
on p. 289 of SR3.)
To pinpoint a signal that the RF
1
tracker has intercepted, make a Tracker
2
Rating Success Test against a target
3
number equal to the transmitting
4
device's Rating +3. Electronic Warfare
5+
may be used as a Complementary Skill
for this test (see Complementary Skills,
p. 97, SR3). The transmitting device
must be operating for at least thirty seconds (ten Combat
Turns), but every additional thirty seconds of scanning time
adds another die to the Success Test, up to a maximum equal
to twice the RF scanner's Rating. (For simplicity, players should
make only one Success Test, at the end of scanning time.) If the
test is successful, the scanner has located the transmitter and
can pinpoint it to a certain degree of accuracy. Count the num-
ber of successes and consult the RF Scanner Accuracy Table to
determine the accuracy.
RF Trackers can only pinpoint signals within the transmitter's
range (as determined by the transmitter's Flux). Extra-sensitive
models with larger arrays are available that can pinpoint a signal
up to 10 times the transmission distance. These models tend to
be bulkier, as they rely on larger antennas and arrays to increase
their sensitivity. Briefcase-sized modules double the normal
transmission range, while backpack-sized units increase range by
5 times normal. The most sensitive versions (10 times normal)
are extremely bulky and generally mounted in vehicles.
Universal Receiver: The universal receiver is a modified
cell phone designed to eavesdrop on nearby cellular conversa-
tions. (It basically intercepts the wireless signal between the
cell phone and the nearby cell tower.) It can also obtain the
phone number for a transmitting cell phone. (This gives it a dis-
tinct advantage over other methods like the Triangulation
Utility, which require the user to know the cell phone number
beforehand.)
To use the universal receiver, the user must be within
range of the cell tower with which the target phone is com-
municating. (To keep things simple, the user should have the
target phone within line of sight.) Make a Rating Success Test
against a Target Number of 5. (The gamemaster may apply
modifiers for electromagnetic interference as appropriate.
Consult the Sensor Test Modifiers Table on p. 136 of SR3 as a
suggested guideline for appropriate
modifiers.) On a single success, the
user has intercepted the phone call and
may attempt to listen in on the conver-
sation. If the test results in 3 or more
successes, the user has also obtained
the number for the target cell phone.
Surveillance Measures
Image Manipulation Software:
With the advent of digital imaging
around the turn of the millennium,
there has been a corresponding rise in
image manipulation software. Most commercial software can
manipulate images well enough to fool even attentive spotters
into thinking a faked image is real.
A character intending to create false or doctored images
needs a computer with image manipulation software loaded
on it. To forge a doctored image, the character makes a
Computer Open Test. The character may use visually based
Knowledge skills in a Complementary Skill Test, as appropriate.
Examples include photography, art, art history, graphic design
and so on. The result of the Open Test is the base target num-
ber used on Perception Tests to spot the forgery.
Film Photography: Though digital photography has
replaced film photography in practically all facets of life, film
photography still has certain uses, mostly artistic. The intelli-
gence community also makes ample use of specialized film for
capturing images that commercially available digital cameras
may not get, and for taking pictures under low light or other
poor visibility conditions without resorting to a flash that might
give away an agent's position and intentions.
Infrared Film: Infrared film is specially treated to be sensi-
tive to infrared radiation. It enables a photographer to take pic-
tures in dim light or darkness without resorting to a flash. Treat
images shot with infrared film as if viewed with cybernetic low-
light vision.
Mana-sensitive Film: Mana-sensitive film is a special
film capable of capturing magical activity and astral images.
The technology derives from early silver daguerreotypes in
the nineteenth century, when photography was in its infan-

cy. During that time many daguerreotype plates captured
ghostly images initially believed to be development errors,
but after the Awakening, research magicians revealed the
phantoms as astral images. A similar type of photography,
called Kirlian photography, has been shown to capture vari-
ous forms of aura emissions and astral spell signatures.
Mana-sensitive film requires its own special type of
camera and film plate. Shooting mana-sensitive film is a long
and arduous process and requires a Complex Action. The
camera only holds one plate at a time. and changing a plate
requires a Complex Action to perform.
The effectiveness of mana-sensitive film in capturing
astral images depends on the nature of the phenomenon and
the skill of the user. Mana-sensitive film easily captures man-
ifesting magicians and spirits; this requires no Success Test.
Other phenomena-background count, dual-natured crit-
ters, aura scanning and spell signature analysis-require a
Success Test (usually using a photography-related
Knowledge Skill). In this case, treat the number of successes
generated as if the user had gotten half the number of suc-
cesses on an Astral Perception Test.
Chips
Aliaschips: Aliaschips are personafix chips, BTLs that
override the user's personality with that of the chip. Unlike
recreational personafix BTLs for illicit entertainment,
aliaschips contain the personality traits and knowledge of
ordinary people: janitors, secretaries, Stuffer Shack clerks and
so on. Covert operatives and deep-cover agents often use
these chips to mimic the personality of a cover identity, to
better avoid detection by counterintelligence. The rating used
is often proportional with the level of infiltration: one-shot
missions requiring a tight cover might only require a Rating 1
or Rating 2 aliaschip, but long-term deep-cover missions,
where the agent is maintaining cover over the course of
years, may require ratings as high as 8, 9 or even 10.
Common programming options for aliaschips include
Cluster, Implant, One-Shot, Optimization, Partial Peak
Controls and Personalized. (See pp. 67-68, CC, for more
information on BTL programming options.) Occasionally an
aliaschip may also incorporate the Black Death option, a sim-
sense variant on the old spy trick of the cyanide capsule in the
hidden tooth. Typically the trigger for activating the Black
Death option is the termination of the aliaschip program.
Aliaschips exist only in direct input format. Chips for
dreamdeck playback are unheard of, as the playback device
is too conspicuous for undercover work.

"Peel 'n' Stick" Vehicle Armor: Peel 'n' Stick armor
consists of armored plates with an adhesive backing that
may be attached to vehicles to temporarily augment protec-
tion. Peel 'n' Stick armor behaves like normal vehicle armor
and adds its rating (up to 3 points) to the vehicle's normal
armor rating. After 24 hours, however, the adhesive loses its
stickiness and the plates fall off. Additionally, if an attack
with a base Power greater than twice the augmented armor
rating strikes the vehicle, it reduces the effectiveness of the
Peel 'n' Stick armor by -1.

THE PATH OF THE ADEPT
like to think I know a lot about the denizens of the shadows and that I keep up with the lat-
-
est advances, whether they're tech, social or magic. But on a night out on the town
recently I learned a few things from a chummer over some drinks that made me realize I
was behind the curve when it came to adepts. I realized that it's been many years since I
set my sights on those whose magic takes on a very personal, and often very physical, qual-
ity. I figured it would be interesting to ask my pal to offer Shadowland users some insight into
the mindsets of what may paradoxically be one of the least understood types of magic users.
He's a bit of an academic, being a studied fellow, but he knows his stuff.

I'm what most of you know as an adept, a follower of the inner path. Since the very first
manifestations of adept powers, magical theorists and academics have tried to categorize and
quantify this particular expression of magic. In recent years even the scientific community has
acknowledged that the range of adept powers is becoming significantly broader, making old
labels inadequate. Many adept abilities simply aren't sufficiently distinct, visible and evident
enough to allow traditional categorization. The scientific community's ineffectual attempts to
definitively catalogue adept abilities underline the plain truth that the Sixth World still lacks a
comprehensive definition of what it means to be an adept.
· Mainstream awareness of adepts has also taken longer. During the decade or so following
the Awakening, those whose Gift expressed as inner magic went mostly ignored as folks'
attention focused on flashy sorcery and conjuring.
· Magister
. It didn't help that many of the first expressions of adept powers were discreet boosts to people's
natural abilities and not particularly glaring. It was only when Rodney Cole ran the one hundred
meter dash in under 8.5 seconds at the 2018 World Championships that people really caught on.

Constantly evolving variations and previously unidentified
abilities are not uncommon. Accurately categorizing adept
powers has proven next to impossible since similar powers
manifest in so many different forms. Most often intense focus
and training shape an adept's abilities, but sometimes the sub-
conscious itself shapes the way powers manifest.
. That's an interesting thought. Most magic use relies on
focused conscious willpower. The fact that adepts can, at least
partially, mold their magic subconsciously is pretty unique and
even contrary to some schools of thought regarding the nature
of mana.
. Miss Tick
. Yeah, the field is getting broader. Just this week I caught on
to the fact that my fixer is an adept. He's been using his talents
to run circles around us every time we sit down to negotiate.
Just ain't right I tell ya, when a man can't even trust his fixer.
· Crow
· Right, and you think I haven't caught a whiff of Dinah's pher-
emones by now? All's fair in love and business, chummer.
· Chessman
Since the first registered instances of adept abilities back
in the teens, understanding and perceptions of what adepts are
and what they are capable of have changed significantly. It's
becoming more and more obvious those gifted with inner
magic are naturally versatile at channeling mana into different
somatic expressions and powers. This, as well as the interest
and money pouring into research, points to adepts as one of
the segments of the magic community showing the greatest
growth.
. An MIT&T study shows a 3 percent increase in the adept pop-
ulation worldwide over the last 5 years. Charles University and
Cambridge have it as high as 5 percent.
· Silicon Mage
. This has a lot to do with the fact that a number of new ways
have been identified and previously unaccounted-for adepts
now figure in the numbers. It isn't strictly a population growth
issue, so much as a discovery of existing Talents.

WALKING THE WAYS
My username, Elan Vital, is a term conceived by Henri
Bergson. a nineteenth-century French philosopher. It was his
term for "the stuff of life." You'll have to excuse me if I turn too
academic here, but Elan Vital, more specifically, defines a hypo-
thetical force responsible for the evolution of human will. I like
the name, and Bergson's concepts, for if he lived today in the
Awakened world, his thoughts might have best described the
concept of various adept's ways far better than my own. If I were
to further his thinking, I would suggest that in the metahuman
species magical expression is simultaneously affected by con-
scious introspection and subconscious residual image (an image
projected externally by the adept).
Now, before I completely frighten off readers, let me try to
put that in layman's terms. In practice, the ways adepts follow
are a deceptively simple and natural aspect of adept develop-
ment, but they are also a complex concept for theorists to nail
down. At the risk of oversimplifying, a way is a focus for per-
sonal development, a path an adept consciously or sometimes
subconsciously follows toward a personal ideal. This archetyp-
al focus and its inherent mental outlook defines the adept's
abilities by channeling his inner magic in specific ways. For
instance, a follower of the artist's way is far less likely to devel-
op destructive abilities when his gifts are naturally focused
toward creation, while an adept of the speaker's way will nat-
urally tend to develop socially oriented powers, as opposed to
physical ones.
· So a way defines an adept's abilities?
· GnuB
. There's no doubt ways guide the manner in which an adept
develops his abilities. For some adepts, these abilities express
spontaneously; for others, their abilities are developed through
focused training. Some powers, especially metamagic, only
seem obtainable by formal training. Arguably, adepts who nat-
urally express their abilities learn faster, but those who cultivate
their talents with lessons have more control over the direction
they take. And there's always the fact that your subconscious
sometimes harbors dark and disturbing things, like repressed
feelings and buried animosities, that may affect an adept's
personal development.
· Hiro
. The real question is, does the magic enhance your natural
interests, or is your way defined by the abilities you express?
Does the Gift send you down a given path or do you choose
which path to follow? Now there's a tough one.
· Silicon Mage
. Bet your hoop that some corps out here have teams of
behavioral psychologists and mind-control technicians hard at
work figuring out if they can mold an adept's inherent abilities
through cheerful methods like strict control of the childhood
environment, response conditioning and any other manipula-
tive methods their sick minds can devise. Just think what a corp
could do with an army of self-made adepts.
. Tom-Three
In Western cultures, "ways" are not seen as bodies of
beliefs, codes of conduct or symbolic constructs like a magi-
cian's tradition. They are much less restrictive and reflect an
individual's personality, ideals and outlook on life. As such,
knowingly or not, most adepts follow a way, though many
individual and cultural variants exist. In fact, most of the ways
we explore in this piece should be seen as archetypal of
State of the Art: 2064
42

Page 37:
THE PATH OF THE ADEPT
NOVATECH
Western cultures rather than globally representative. Western
magical theory acknowledges "ways" as personal, though
other cultures across the globe believe these life paths are
inseparable from other cultural mores and beliefs.
It also bears mentioning that there are a few cases of
adepts who have yet to find their way and those that never do.
These are sometimes called the "Lost" and they inevitably find
it harder to develop their skills and gifts without the focus that
a way provides.
. These "Lost" are not as uncommon as Elan seems to think.
Some people simply lack the kind of personality to adopt a
way, others find they drift away when something happens to
make them lose their direction or shake their belief in their way.
Still others never reconcile the fact they are Awakened.
Without the focus of a way's mindset, an adept's powers and
gifts become harder to develop, and his magic is usually chan-
neled by random necessity and desire.
· Kwai Chang
THE SPIRIT WAY
Part of my responsibility in this upload, and probably the
easiest aspect of the entire chore, is to explain the philosophy
of the spirit way, which I follow. The spirit way embodies the
harmony of the physical and the astral worlds. The physical
world is an empty shell without the astral, and many of the
mysteries and secrets of life and the spirits are revealed when
an adept walks this path. I learned the guidance of my way
from my grandfather, who once wrote an essay on Shadowland
on this very subject.
All followers of the spirit way have the Sight, the ability to
view the astral plane at will. Without this ability, it is impossi-
ble to find the center of the ideal the way drives toward, the
essence of the "other world" and its impact on your personali-
ty, your strength of will and the power of your mind. It isn't
necessary to develop the body with this way. While I like to
keep in shape for my health, this way does not advocate build-
ing physical strength or health, as with the athlete's way or
warrior's way.
. I believe the body must have the mind, and the mind must
have the body, especially for the Awakened. Think of the magi-
cians who have been lost on the astral plane, their spirits sepa-
rated from their bodies, dying in a very short time. I would cau-
tion readers to keep harmony in body and mind.
· Fortune
My specialty is the study of the metahuman soul, aura, life
force or whatever other term for the "stuff of life" you prefer. I
use my gift to learn, and I have learned to study the astral-a
world ripe with hidden knowledge for those who would seek it
out. I have full confidence I will succeed in every case I take for
my profession, as a private detective and hired counsel by
many governmental agencies. I excel at solving riddles and
unraveling mysteries, and I always rely on the guidance of the
astral world.
. I'll vouch. Elan's a damn fine PI and a consultant for the FBI in
cases involving mumbo jumbo they can't figure. I've crossed
tracks with him once, while "unofficially" investigating a job (my
employer didn't trust the authorities to get it right). Better to
steer clear of that gaze of his. It'll bore a hole straight through
your brain and leave you jelly-legged to boot.
· SPD
When I perceive the astral, I have the ability to absorb a
host of clues in a matter of seconds. My magic calls out the
emotions and feelings of those who have passed through,
interacted or dwelt in the scene. When I perceive a soul, I
learn far more about the soul than he or she could imagine,
and far more than even most other Awakened. I can sense the
inner and outer motivations of the soul, even when those
motivations were meant to remain hidden. The naked eye is
blind in comparison. The physical world can deceive, but the
astral doesn't lie.
· When I first learned of adepts exploring the astral, like many
of my peers, I laughed. Adepts are Awakened, but let's face it,
the astral world is the domain of magicians.
· Neo-stradamus
. The world is ever changing, chummer, and you better hop on
board. I've met Elan, and he's one of only three folks I know able
to tag me as a mage regardless of my Masking. The other two
were my mentors. His sight is keener than any mage's I know.
· Fatima
As a result of prolonged use of true Sight, my physical
sight has become exceptionally sharp. Scientists will tell you
that people must be born with a photographic memory or suf-
fer traumatic brain injury that creates a savant-like memory-
but not the Awakened, for many of us develop a faculty for
dimensional memorization, an evolved photographic memory.
. This claim isn't substantiated by science. I've been privy to
research into the subject and there was no conclusive evi-
dence of "dimensional memory." It was dismissed.
· Logik
In the pursuit of my way, I have yet to delve into the
denizens of the astral world, though many adepts of the spirit
way spend decades studying and learning them. They pursue
understanding of the true nature of spirits, the duality of soul
and being and the mysteries of the higher planes.
. Many would say the true calling of the spirit way lies less in the
study of the metahuman aura than in study of spirits.
· Magister
. There's no right or wrong take on a way, other than a man's
natural calling. As my grandson Elan said up front, ways are sim-
ply conventions to label individuals with similar outlooks.

Assuming one person's perspective on a way is more valid than
another's is misleading. Ways are as personal as a personality,
and in the end each person's perspective is as unique as his
retinal scan or fingerprint tests.

THE WARRIOR'S WAY
Finding a follower of the way of the warrior to handle this
bit proved much harder than expected. Not because they are
rare and hard to find, but because few of the ones I know could
be bothered to take the time to actually write down their
thoughts. Guerrero may have a checkered past, but in this case
it plays in his favor. He has severed his former affiliations and
now is a free agent out of Denver.
//Begin File Attachment//
Strange how things work out. Two years ago I was an elite
Jaguar Guard operating in the Yucatan; today I'm just another
runner eking out a living in Denver's shadows. It's amazing
what a close encounter with a great dragon will do to your
career perspectives. Not that I had high hopes to begin with; I
had too much Anglo blood in me (or "not enough commit-
ment," as my officers called it) to make the high ranks. I never
played along with the priests or developed into one of the
cold-hearted fraggers people think of when they think of
Jaguars. I never did get the souped-up foci and blood gifts they
reserve for their fanatics. Then again, maybe that was for the
best. I was working security at the Pyramid when Ghostwalker
trashed it. I survived. I took the hint and changed my lifestyle.
. The Jags aren't the only ones that recruit adepts; most
Native American nations and quite a few other militaries go
out of their way to locate and sign up adepts, including test-
ing all new recruits for Talent. They don't usually get outstand-
ing treatment unless they show particular promise, in which
case they're scooped up for special forces and black ops
work. Sioux Wildcats and Tir Ghosts number more than a few
warrior's way adepts.
· Wynde

Fuilleach in Tir na nÓg, they follow this way too?

· Hotwire Martyr
I'm here to tell you about the path I follow, what my drill
instructors simply called El Camino, known up north as the way
of the warrior. As you can probably guess, I'm not the most
well-adjusted guy in the world; all my life I've been a scrapper.
Growing up a gringo in a tough barrio of Tenochtitlan and get-
ting the short end of the stick, even after my Talent brought me
to the attention of the Jaguars, means I've always carried
around a lot of pent-up resentment and anger. That's fine,
though, since my way is all about learning to direct and focus
that aggression, channeling that destructive emotion to make
me a better fighter. Warriors are one of the most common
adept types in the shadows. The violent nature of the biz nat-
urally appeals to them.
· Warrior adepts come in all shapes and sizes, from Viking
berserkers to zen archers. Their common denominator is a focus
on conflict and turning their destructive bent into an art form.
What separates a Gladio pit fighter from a world-class boxer
adept isn't his ability but outlook; an athlete strives to excel in
his field, a warrior lives for conflict. It's all in the mind.
· Johnny Zen
. Unlike the traditions of full-on magicians, ways allow for a lot
of leeway. While a street fighter finds a focus for his natural
aggressiveness and thrives on violence for its own sake, others
follow a code and see the way of the warrior as a path to mar-
tial excellence. Different strokes, but both use conflict as a
path to an ideal.
· Samurai Jack
The abilities and gifts I've developed through focus and
training make me the match of any razorboy, though initia-
tion has made me stronger, faster and more lethal. Some
warriors like myself prefer to concentrate on one fighting
technique or weapon. My weapons of choice are blades of all
types, from throwing knives to monoswords. Something
about the way they feel, like extensions of my body. But I've
met warriors who are martial arts monsters and masters at
other weapons, both in the Jaguars and among the shadows.
In all cases, our gifts make us superhuman fighters: resilient,
deadly and lightning fast.
. And people say I've got an attitude!
· Prime Runner
No less dangerous. For these guys combat is a vocation.
· Brand
· Saw a gunslinger showing his skills off at a rodeo down in
Dallas/Fort Worth, sharpshooting from a speeding bike. As he
flashed past the stands, we heard one long crack from his
revolver. Thing is, when the camera crew replay went over the
rodeo's big screen, it showed a neat 6-pack of bullet holes in
the target. At first I thought he was cybered, but I peeked at his
aura between shows and lo-and-behold: an adept.

this way also develop the abilities their Talent grants them
defensively. There's no point in winning a fight if you're as
fragged up as the enemy. Some try to make themselves
impossible to touch, others boost their physical endurance to
take the hits. Ultimately a warrior goes with whatever it takes
to be the last man standing.

THE ARTIST'S WAY
Zephyr is a friend I know from a period I spent in Denver.
She wasn't my first choice to cover this bit-to be honest, she
wasn't even on the short list. But in hindsight, I think what she
has to say will be an eye opener to anyone who assumes that
artists are those intellectual snobs you see parked at gallery
openings guzzling champagne.
//Begin File Attachment//
Hi y'all, this is Zephyr and I'm gonna talk about my views
on adept magic, life and all that good stuff. Elan called me a
while ago and asked if I knew any artist types. I asked him if I
would do. Before he could get out an objection, I told him to
think about it. Well, he thought about it and agreed.
People I've worked with usually think of me as a rigger or
a driver. I prefer to think of myself as more of a mechanic,
though even that doesn't really cover it. Sure, I can drive
almost anything, but that's not my true passion. My thing is
tech: gadgets, toys, cars, you name it. Believe me, what I can
do with hard tech is nothing short of artistry. That's my knack;
I'm a maker and a tinkerer. I can build almost anything, jury-rig
and tweak any kind of device, take apart just about anything
and put it together again better than new.
Nothing beats the thrill of designing something complete-
ly new, though! I'm lucky I live in the shadows, where I can
practice my art as I see fit, without worrying about things like
"marketing potential" or "profit margins." Spirits, but I love
building and coming up with new stuff!
. Yeah, you could say Zeph improved my Scorpion in much the
same way a painter "improves" a canvas.
· Blitzkrieg
Since we don't have some megacorp's resources at our
fingertips, an added bonus of life in the shadows is gear
scrounging. "Nothing to fear if you've got the gear!" is doubly
true if you've designed and built it with your own two hands. I
know my creations' limits like I know those of my own body,
probably better in some cases.
. There's a lesser way emerging these days. We call it the way
of the savant, and as far as I can see, Zephyr fits the mental
profile close enough, though her creative outlook makes all the
difference. She obviously loves getting her hands dirty, not real-
ly our sort of thing.
· Idle Savant
. You've hit the nail on the proverbial head. It's all in the head;
everything depends on your outlook. The difference between
an artist and a savant is that the first loves the act of creation
while the latter craves the mental challenge. Sort of like how an
athlete fights for the pleasure of competition, while to a warrior
it's just what he does.
· Silicon Mage
Don't assume I'm an antisocial techno-geek, locked up in
my workshop all the time, and never hanging out with people.
While I do spend a lot of time elbow-deep in grease, I'm far
from a shut-in. I like hanging out with my chummers as much
as the next gal. I care for them, and when a bike I customized
saves a friend's life, it's like I've done it myself. While art is its
own reward, the appreciation of others is important.
Now, to be honest not everything I do is art. When the
chips are down and I need the cash or someone calls in a favor,
I do just about any tech job. Honestly, it depends on the per-
son, but for some of them, my heart just isn't in it. Doesn't
mean I don't do my best, but the result just wasn't the same.
. Not all artists produce something material; some of us are
performers who value the reaction of the audience as the most
important thing. Zephyr hints at this when she talks about her
friends enjoying her work, but for those who don't create a
physical object, it's the connection to the audience we're
looking for. By the way, I said "reaction" for a reason.
Sometimes we're trying to get a message across, rather than
just produce entertainment-of course, we'd like to get back
to that someday.
· Olivier
My Talent's proved a huge help in my work. Most of the
work I do will void the warranty, so service access wasn't part
of the design criteria. My body's real flexible and my fingers
don't shake at all, which are big help with my work. Extra
strength helps too when extracting an engine or mounting a
door.
· Or if your power steering gets shot out. Magic would be nice

Despite the trid archetypes of adepts as combat monsters,
our magic can enhance our bodies in less obvious ways too. For
example, almost all tech has some horribly deadly poisons
involved in either manufacture or use-hydrozine jet fuel can
kill you if you touch a wet spot on the pavement-but I've

been able to develop a resistance to toxins. Magic even boosts
my mental agility, my ability to plan and reason, and I can skim
the manual while hacking the work at the same time.
. Personally, I like being able to "see" my audience. Nothing
helps you gauge a crowd like astral perception.
· Social Adept
My magic has increased my devotion to my art, and vice
versa. I can't imagine one without the other. I might be the
same person without my magic, but then again, I might not.
I'm sure nothing else would be the same.

THE ATHLETE'S WAY
For the next piece, I've asked for the help of not one but
two old friends. Both follow the way of the athlete and though
they're twins, they've taken completely different paths in life.
So much for stereotypes. Sandi is an accomplished acrobat
with the Cirque du Soleil troupe in Europe and Samantha is a
prize-fighting kickboxer on the Ultimate Fighting
Championship (UFC) circuit. As to how I know the twins-well,
that's a cherished memory I think I'll keep to myself.
//Begin File Attachment//
Sandi: Let's get this show on the road. You start, sis.
Sam: Right. The way Elan explained this to me, he seems to think
it's interesting that Sam and I took such different roads in life,
being twins, somatic adepts and followers of the same "way." He
says it's an "exemplary case of divergent subconscious projection
in sibling rivalry." Reminds me why we don't date anymore.
Anyway, back to us. Sandi and I grew up in Portland-yes, we're
both elves too, stop drooling. As you may or may not know,
schools in the Tir make physical fitness a priority; it's almost a
national craze-a sound mind in a sound body and all that. It's
billed as preparation for the Rite of Progression, which is physi-
cally demanding. Even back then, Sandi and I were on different
frequencies, she the gymnast and me the track-and-field nut.
Sandi: Keep in mind that the Tir does extensive testing for
magical talent; it even has its own version of the Dumas Test
called the Xavier Exam. Sam and I tested negative during pri-
mary and secondary school. Not surprising really, most people
in Elfland do, regardless of the Council's propaganda. You
could say we were late bloomers.

· Or not. The Dumas Test and its counterparts were designed to
detect active magic potential, but in many adepts the Talent

Sam: I was the first to manifest my Talent. I was walking home
from practice one evening and a couple of Tuskboyz looking for
some action jumped me. They got more than they bargained
for. Our older brother's a Peace Forcer and he'd been teaching
us carromeleg. I went into defensive stance as one grabbed for
me and something quite literally kicked in. The two thugs were
down in a heartbeat. Both had to be hospitalized.
Sandi: For me it happened a few months later, during the try-
outs for the national gymnastics team. I was trailing and I really
needed the points on the asymmetrical bars. My routine went
okay, but I was way too tense, too stiff. Suddenly everything
faded, the bars came into clear focus, my body swung and
twisted through my routine with incredible ease. My muscles
rippled with new strength, my mind was crystal clear and my
confidence grew. On the fly, I decided to improvise the ending.
something really flashy. I swung up and out, and shocked
myself with a perfect triple Lermetov. To cut a long story short,
the jury boasted a mage, and despite my complaints I was dis-
qualified for using a Gift I didn't even know I had!
Sam: Ironically, our new found Gifts put an end to our budding
athletic careers, at least as far as official competitions went.
Magic is still seriously frowned upon in both international ath-
letics and gymnastics. Neither of us was much interested in the
offers that were fielded for us to join the Peace Force and even
paladin groups. In fact, life in the Tir was getting unbearably
repressive back then. We pooled our savings and moved to
Seattle despite mum's pleas.
Sandi: I was getting desperate to find work when a talent
agent who'd been in the Tir and seen my performance rang me
up. He asked if I'd be interested in a career in showbiz. I'm not
entirely sure why I said yes, but I can't say I regret it. A couple
of seasons as part of a Vegas extravaganza was enough for the
Cirque du Soleil to pick up my multi-trapeze act. The Cirque
boasts quite a few adepts among its acts, and I fit right in, even
though I had to move to Europe to get the job.
· Sandi isn't kidding either. While circuses nowadays with their
big stage extravaganzas and musical features owe less to
Barnum than to the Moulin Rouge, human talent is the big
draw. Barred from pursuing their Gift in sports, athlete adepts
make for excellent contortionists, knife-throwers and acrobats
of all sorts.
· Big Ring
Sam: Me? I liked the thrill I got from that fight. Not the vio-
lence, but the power and skill. When we moved to Seattle I
joined a sparring club run by an adept named Johnny Zen and
eventually made my way into the only league-legal, that is-
that takes adepts: the UFC. These days I'm ranked ninth world-
wide, but I'm in no hurry.
. Wait, this is Sammy K? Wow! I saw her take down Lucy Marriot
last month in Atlanta. Chillin' fighting girl, I'm impressed. Hey
Sammy, if you ever take to the shadows, drop me a line.
· Riot Grrrl
· The UFC has a fair number of warriors as well as athletes in the
ranking. Sammy's one of the new generation who's moving in
on the big money prizes.
· Hammer
Sandi: People tell me my way is all about striving for an ideal
of physical perfection, to excel as an acrobat; that it's about fac-
ing my physical limits and overcoming them. Personally all this
"way" business seems a little silly. I just want to be one of the
best, or at least the best that I can be. I don't think of it as a
deliberate path in life, I never have. I bet Elan would tell me I'm
still "subconsciously developing toward an idealized self-
image" but that's just my point; it's not a conscious decision for
me, or for Sam or a number of athlete adepts I've met.
Compared to those of some adepts out there, our abilities are
actually pretty dull. In most cases, they simply boost natural
skills and abilities to exceptional levels.

· Better say "superhuman" levels-which is why adepts are
banned in most non-augmented leagues. Professional sports
authorities still view magical enhancement as detrimental to
the sport, like cyber, and keep adepts off the field.
· MVP
. The overall anti-magic bias in the sports world is pervasive.
Magic is viewed with suspicion by many fans and purists who
believe it's a game-breaker. Any inkling of magic use at a
major Olympic event, for Instance, is still enough to disqualify
the participants. A few countries make exceptions but in most
cases they still place magically enhanced athletes in sepa-
rate leagues.

THE INVISIBLE WAY
The following is the result of an honor debt that I called in.
You see, a proponent of the invisible way that engages in crim-
inal activity should be expected to remain, well, invisible.
Sometimes that isn't possible, particularly if I am on the job.
Anyway, this testimonial comes from someone highly respect-
ed among his peers and remarkably capable of slipping out of
sight and mind.

My street name is Neko. In English, it translates to cat, and
when I started out, it seemed appropriate. When I was young,
I envisioned making a name for myself; born with natural, swift,
cat-like reflexes and matchless grace, moving with the lightest
footfalls on rooftops and across hallways. I studied ballet for a
time as a child, and I studied kenjitsu under my father. As a
man, I now embody the traits of the cat I once aspired to, and
the name Neko bears my reputation. But I have grown in my
way, and I find it no longer represents me in entirety.
Why, you may ask? Because cats, for all their wonderful
grace, can be seen and heard and caught. Were I to choose a
name today, I would take the Latin term Nemo, or Mumeishi in
my native Japanese, "nobody" or "anonymous" in English. To be
unknown is a crucial advantage in my line of work, and my pow-
ers bring me closer to that end every day. Though you have likely
never heard of me, I am a member of what is known in law-
enforcement circles as the Nightingale Syndicate. We procure fine
treasures from the clutches of those who would hoard and lock
them away.
. C'mon man, call it by its name. You're a thief. That's T-H-I-E-F.
· Cynic
. Aren't most shadowrunners? Actually, Neko's a brilliant cat
burglar. He's made "Most Wanted" lists in twelve countries and
all the security corps know his handle. But a name is just that,
without a face. Apparently, nobody really knows what he looks
like or who he is.
· X-Star
I am writing this today because I was caught once, by my
friend and rival Elan. There is great irony is describing my
mindset to you, for my master would no doubt question how I
can remain out of sight and mind by registering in print the
things that make me so. But nonetheless, a debt is a debt, and
I am nothing if not honorable.
. So there really is honor among thieves. Not the ones I've
known.
· Don-o
I must address the name of my path, the so-called invisi-
ble way. At first read, it conjures images of ancient ninja in the
night and the unheard whispers and movements of the dark-
ness. While often these traits are true, even of myself in my
younger years, it is also important to recognize the scope of
the term invisible beyond its obvious implications. After all,
this is the path of not being obvious.
. Despite Neko's digression, there is in fact a thriving invisible way
subculture comprised of modern day adepts styling themselves
as ninjas and silent assassins. They are actually the most common
followers of the way, from what I have observed.
· Riddick
I envision the invisible way as affecting all senses; to touch
and leave no trace, to bear no smell, leave no sound, to have
keen sight of the interaction your body has with its surround-
ing. To be invisible in life is not only to be unheard and unseen
but to embrace the concept of being unknown.
My way defines my life. While on the job, I simply can-
not be found if I choose not to be. My feet caress the grass
and blades bend underfoot, yet no sound or track will ever be
seen. My balance is without equal and I can scale sheer walls
at a sprint. I can contort into the smallest of boxes or crawl-
spaces should I need to hide (I was once smuggled into a
high-security hotel in a carry-on suitcase) or drop several
floors without harm if haste is required. If I am detected, the
person will be left uncertain of his senses, with only a grow-
ing shadow of doubt as to what I was crossing his or her
mind. Even in the open, under direct scrutiny, I am humble
and easily overlooked, or mistaken for something other than
what is sought.
In my early years, if spotted I would appear in the follow-
ing manner on the trid; dressed in all black, with a mask on my
face and a hood covering my head, operating only at night.
But I have felt my power evolve over the years, as I have
grown closer and closer to the embodiment of Nemo. I have
learned to actually become Joe Nobody, by altering my facial
muscles and bone structure, and by lightening or darkening
my skin tone. I can physically mask my Japanese heritage, and
I have been known to change my appearance multiple times
in the course of a penetration. With a few seconds of concen-
tration, I can make myself anonymous. I have expanded the
concept of invisible and may walk in the light of day indis-
criminately, unnoticed, invisible in the mind's eye. My true
identity becomes a listless fog in the mind of those I meet;
indeed, sometimes even in my own mind I begin to forget.
//End File Attachment//
. I knew a guy like this. He could walk into a high-security
building, stroll past the guards without getting a glance and
make himself unsuspicious, as if he just belonged. He would
rob places in the middle of the day, right in front of everybody
and maybe even recruit some help hauling the goods out.

THE SPEAKER'S WAY
The following is an excerpt of a speech given by Sister
Mary Eiledon, recorded at a local chapter meeting of the Sisters
of Eglantine by Donald Fereh, a reporter and editor of the "Life
and Magic" e-zine. The Sisters of Eglantine, as the name indi-
cates, are a community of women linked to the Mutter Erde
policlub. Given the current election year, the Sisters have been
very active in their community, so representatives of various
candidates and other support groups were present.

spoken from certain mouths, and in centuries past, before the
Awakening, they carried truth.
But I submit to you that the speaker radiates power and
magic, for words may be empty or weak. How often have you
all heard an electoral candidate utter the expression, "for the
children," or a lawyer whine, "taken out of context." There is
no power in those words.
There is a passage from a speech that I learned as a young
woman in college, an excerpt of which reads: "If a man is called
to be a street sweeper, he should sweep streets even as
Michelangelo painted, or Beethoven played music, or
Shakespeare wrote poetry. He should sweep streets so well
that all the hosts of heaven and earth will pause to say, here
lived a great street sweeper who did his job well."
Powerful. These words stir the heart. Martin Luther King Jr.
cared about his home and his passion, and his words inspired me
in my youth. I care about my home, my community. These streets
are our responsibility. There are forces at work, attempting to
drive the soul of Goddess out of our home, attempting to destroy
the majesty and beauty of the community, and for "only a cheap
nuyen," as my mother would say. The Sisters of Eglantine will
step out in force on the streets this year, speaking to the home-
less, the chip-induced lost, the wayward souls in need of faith and
love. We have the power of the magic in our voices and Goddess
is with us, and our counsel inspires hope in the hopeless.

. There's heavy irony in the fact that we're reading the words
of a supposedly powerful feminist orator, thereby stripping her
of all her power. But even in just writing, she certainly seems per-

· Interesting quote. The Sisters are street sweepers themselves.
If they want you off the street, then they get you off the street-
and they don't just use words, prayers or kindness. Ask my
chummer, Hot Rod, who was laid up for three weeks at Ngyun's
chop shop.

Fereh: Miss Mary, your speech was riveting. There wasn't one
interruption from the crowd, not one bathroom break or
cough. How do you hold the audience so well?
Elledon: It's a matter of self-discovery and confidence.
Everyone has the power within him or her for speech. For the
Awakened, the potency of our words can transfix and sway a
crowd. Splash in some passion and the words inspire. My
voice is my gift.
. My voice is my gift-I follow this way-but I don't claim false
nobility for my acts. My knack is simply to convince people to
give me things they had previously thought valuable. I'm not
God's (or the Goddess's) gift to metahumanity, I'm just very,
very persuasive.
· Grifter
Fereh: Are you saying that being Awakened helps you in this job?
Elledon: It is not a job, Mr. Fereh. It is a life's passion. And yes,
having been blessed by the Goddess with powers greater than
the average person is a tremendous advantage. But it is not the
gift that helps, rather how you use the gift. I have rescued chil-
dren from the streets with soft, kind words and an open heart. I
have restored hope to aging souls drowning their lives in abuse
of the temptations of the streets. I grow more confident with my
voice, and my knowledge can bring people back to a real life.
· It's not just activists and con men making use of their social
talents. Other speaker's way adepts include politicians and
lawyers (well, ok, bad examples), teachers, actors-hell, even
the coach of the Texas Lone Stars is a speaker adept (and they
got to the World Series last year)!
· Grifter
Fereh: You say the Goddess blessed you with powers. Who is
she and what exactly did she give you?
Elledon: She has had many names and identities over the
years. Most look upon Diana as the finest embodiment. She
blessed me with the power of sense. To speak to someone,
especially a person without hope, requires keen senses. 1
empathize with their grief. I can see their despair with my eyes,
Mr. Fereh, hear it in their voice tone, feel it in their touch. When
I speak to someone, I can feel my power, my emotion coursing
through the person's soul. Could you not feel my disposition
growing on you during my speech? To be an effective speaker,
one must understand and open one's soul to the powers of the
higher senses. To truly give and to receive. Speech is far more
than voice and words.
Fereh: Do you ever prepare your speeches?
Eiledon: Of course, to some extent. But often the impact of
prepared speech is weaker than of inspired spontaneity. The
act of drawing the words from the heart while standing in the
fire of the audience is part of the majesty of the moment.
Fereh: Thank you, Miss Mary, for your time and beautiful words.

THE SHAMANIC WAY
Followers of the shamanic way are far more common
among the NAN and other tribal cultures than the urban shad-
ows. Like shamans, these adepts follow totems, but have a dis-
tinct approach from their magical counterparts. The shamanic
adept-also called a totemic adept or a follower of the animal
way-tries to embody the idealized qualities of his totem, see-
ing it as a way, a path or an ideal to emulate. This expresses
best in the powers they manifest, which often mimic enhanced
versions of the totem's natural abilities. I've called in a friend to

bring you the inside perspective on the shamanic way. He's a
little gruff, but someone you can count on when in a bind,
that's just his style. Without further ado, here's Howler.
//Begin File Attachment//
My given name is Jack Thunder, but my friends call me
Howler. I'm a Sioux half-blood of the Yantonais tribe, and I was a
Wildcat until I ran into some trouble with an officer. You might say
I have problems with authority figures-must be the Wolf in me.
Vital and I share a history. I still owe him for help in track-
ing down a couple of fugitives that skipped into the Salish-
Shidhe. That's what I do by, the way, I'm a bounty hunter.
Appropriate, since my totem is the great hunter himself,
Brother Wolf. Which is why Vital asked me to give this a shot.
I'm what the eggheads call a shamanic adept.
Various Eastern martial arts boast "animal-like" abilities and
techniques, though their approach to totemic power is com-
pletely different. Adepts who train in these traditions distill the
animal's natural savagery through zen techniques until they
are at one with the beast and control its abilities.
· Kwai Chang
. What about the animal warriors in Azanian tribes? They tattoo
symbols of their totem on their bodies to power their gifts.
· Elijah
Unlike others that I've known who follow Brother Wolf, I'm
not the type to run with a pack-a lone wolf, as it were. Old
Dancing Crow, my tribe's shaman, once told me Wolf was par-
ticularly strong in me. When I used his gifts he might come out
and I would walk in his skin. A street mage friend of mine calls
it a shamanic mask, but what does he know?
A wolf on the prowl is a scary thing. I recall the time a
Cherokee gunrunner got the drop on me outside Butte. When
he saw Brother Wolf descend on me, he freaked and got off a
couple of rounds-one grazed my temple and knocked me out
cold. Unfortunately for him, he pissed himself too. I tracked
him for two days through the woods on scent alone. Still wear
a couple of his gold teeth as a charm.
. The totems lend us their eyes, ears, reflexes, speed, stealth
and claws as they see fit, but each warrior's relation with his
totem is unique. To me, Bear is the guardian and wise chief. To
my mother, Bear is a healer and wise woman, hibernating to
seek the deepest truths, the honey of life.

. Many tribes make no distinction between a full shaman and
a shamanic adept-they are both touched by the spirits.
They're considered the tribe's guardians and guides.
· Notch
I can't speak for anyone else-I've heard there are those
who resist the totem's call or even try to tame it-but it's exhil-
arating to feel Wolf's breath, look through his eyes, smell the
world through his nose. There's nothing quite like running with
Brother Wolf, tracking prey, ripping with his claws and teeth. To
be honest, sometimes it's fraggin' hard to rein him in. If I get hurt
or lose it in a scrap, the blood lust just takes over. When Vital first
helped me out, tracking down a runaway tribal kid up Seattle
way, we were cornered by some Yaks running protection for the
bunraku parlor that had the kid. The idiots taunted me way too
much, even nicked me with a katana. Brother Wolf was not
happy when he came out. I ripped them to shreds, not even
aware of what I had done until we had finished tracking the boy.
· Sounds cool, but I don't see a difference between Howler
and the scrappers who follow the way of the warrior.
· GnuB
. Howler actually believes he's embodying Wolf. I'm not going
to tell him he's wrong. Are you?
· San
I keep hearing shamanic adepts have a way with animals.
Though it's strange for a hunter, it's true for me. I'm not sure it's
that common, though. This affinity thing gave me a surprise last
winter. I was following up on a bounty, a lone she-wolf ripping
up Genetique cattle up Billings way. I tracked her over the
snowdrifts after a kill, moving downwind. She smelled sick to
me, maybe the genemeat she'd been feeding on, maybe some-
thing worse. Took her down nice and clean just outside her lair.
Heavy with a meal, she was no match for Brother Wolf's reflex-
es. I was about to leave with the pelt when I heard scrabbling
from inside the rock lair. It couldn't be a mate, I would've
sniffed his mark. Turned out to be a cub, no more than a coupla
months old. I couldn't bring myself to leave it out there to die.
so I took it in. Blizzard is coming along just fine and we get
along real nice, family-like. Who'da thought? Not the commit-
ment type, me, but I think Brother Wolf was giving me a hint.
Dancing Crow tells me he's got a trick to teach me, some-
thing about going on a vision quest with Blizzard so he can
share Brother Wolf's gifts. I'm game. Who says you can't teach
an old dog new tricks?

The Magician's way
Adepts of the magician's way are often seen as oddities,
partially because they are relatively rare and partially because
they occupy their own niche in the Sixth World's magical ecol-
ogy. After asking around, I picked Warden off the list of refer-
ences because of his uniqueness. Warden started out like a
mage and discovered his adept abilities later in life.
//Begin File Attachment//
To introduce myself, I'm a mercenary, mage and what Elan
would call a "magician's way adept." Now, I'd call Elan a
"stuffed shirt way adept," but he's more or less on target. I'm
part adept, part magician. On the magician's side, I'm hermet-
ic; on the adept side, I could be considered a speaker's way
adept. Some people say that I can only be a dabbler in both, a
master of neither-I say these distinctions we have between tra-
ditions are a lot thinner than most Awakened want to believe.
I was just your standard issue hermetic until a year ago. As
Picador mentioned in last year's update, magicians aren't all
that useful on a modern battlefield. Spells are about as useful
as arrows against panzers and arrows don't drain you as much.
Anyway, my job was mainly to ward stuff, order elementals
around and talk to the locals. The last part's the fun bit; most of
my squadmates are sick of yabbing to me after a coupla weeks
and elementals are as talkative as the rocks they come from.
I discovered the magician's way when the smuggler I was
riding with failed to dodge a rocket 'bout 20 meters above the
Yucatán. We jumped out and clung to the tree as the chopper
crashed next to an Azzie patrol. We stayed up the tree as l
talked the ear off the Azzies for about two hours before some
rebels ambushed them. Convincing the rebels not to sacrifice
us to their gods was easier.
I found out I was an adept from the rebel doc, while he
removed some shrapnel and a bullet from my back. Couldn't
have been more surprised if he'd mistook me for a troll. He
thanked me for the distraction. Looking back, I had to talk my
way out of so many situations during that trip, I'm not surprised
magic was involved.
Since then, I've read everything I could on this topic and
talked to all the followers of the magician's way I could find.
The only similarity I've found between us is that we are all dif-
ferent. I get stir crazy if I don't have someone to chat with. I
once worked with an ex-Jaguar rebel of the magician's way
who followed some sort of shark totem; saw him stun a squad
and then tear through them with tooth and claw. The only time
I could sleep was when that fragger was on patrol.
For me, hermetic magic is like math-when you're doing
it, you know it. But being an adept just feels natural; I'm not
sure where talent ends and magic begins. It's not the same
for a friend of mine who follows Coyote. To her, the adept
powers, spellslinging and conjuring are all gifts from Coyote.
During a stint in Africa, I ended up tutoring our guide's kid
who also was multi-talented. He had the hardest time under-
standing spell magic. When I started teaching him, he was
the hero of his village, could outrun people five years older,
pretty much ignored the heat, beat up kids twice his size, you
get the idea. He did everything on a subconscious level. I

tried to show him how to cast levitate, but he couldn't do it
unless it was clear he wasn't gonna make it across the ditch.
Never mind that this was obvious before he leaped. It's not
like the kid was dumb or anything. but he couldn't cast a spell
until the last second. It was the planning, the mental symbol
manipulation that was difficult. What he would do was study
the spell formulas so thoroughly that they became reflexive,
like running or jumping. After that, he had no problem using
spells at the appropriate time, like they were an extension of
his body, some sort of weird astral extra limb. But he never
did get the hang of ritual magic.
That's my scoop on the magician's way. We can throw
spells, call spirits and tap our inner magic potential. How you
rationalize it is pretty much up you.
//End File Attachment//
. The term "magician's way" can be a misnomer. Some adepts
do consider the magician's way their true calling; they focus on
the blending of spellcraft and somatic magic-almost like a
unified theory of magic. But most followers of the magician's
way also adhere to another adept mindset, such as the war-
rior's way or way of the athlete. Likewise, they can adhere to
almost any full magician tradition, from the path of the shaman
to the path of wuxing.

THE WHALE RIDERS
There are countless cultural and ethnic ways and variations
out there, and I was finding it next to impossible to choose one
over another. Strangely enough, one of the first things I found
caught my attention and provided me with a compromise
solution-or, perhaps, a cop-out.
//Begin File Attachment//
National Geographic Travelers: The Whale Rider-Maori
Legend Come True
According to ancient legend, passed down from genera-
tion to generation, the Maori people came to the islands of the
South Pacific riding on the back of a whale. For centuries now,
the mythic whale rider-the ultimate symbol of the Maori peo-
ple's profound connection to nature-was simply regarded as
a curious legend, entertaining ethnic folklore. The descendants
of those ancient heroes, however, are now the hereditary lead-
ers of a vibrant tribal culture or so historians and anthropolo-
gists would have us believe.
It's easy to scoff, of course. But those who do would be
surprised to walk into the peaceful village of Tauranga, over-
looking the Bay of Plenty on New Zealand's Eastern Coast, and
see a whale rider performing a ritual greeting with a great
humpback whale in the shallows. He is 17 years old and his
name is Roi Taimana. Like his father and grandfather before
him, he is the whale rider of the Tauwhare tribe.
While showing us his marvelous tattoo work-which he
promptly assures us is powerful magic to his people-Roi
explained what it means to be the whale rider.
Roi: My people were losing a struggle to preserve our culture
and traditions, and we would have lost had it not been for the
Awakening. It brought new power and meaning to the old ways.
It showed some the ancients had been right all along. But the
people didn't believe. Too much had been lost. Too many people
had lost faith. My grandfather always said our people needed a
symbol, a standard. That was when the first whale rider surfaced,
Mark Winitana. Soon there were more, one from each tribe. My
grandfather was the first of our line. The whale riders are the her-
alds of change as they had been heralds of a new land in the past.
NGT: But what exactly do you do?
Roi: We are the guardians of Maori culture and our way of life.
We are the bond between Maori and nature.
NGT: Sounds romantic being a legend.
Roi: It is a responsibility and an honor, not a privilege. We are
brothers to the whales. We ride them out to sea and we speak
to them as they sing to us. Together we are more than the sum
of our parts.
NGT: Yes, but how do you do such things?
Roi: You would call it magic. The professors at the University of
Auckland say that we are "adepts." To me, it doesn't really
matter. Those are details. What matters is the legends were
true and riders are again the symbol of my people's pact with
nature. We are its protectors and stewards and in return we are
granted its gifts.
NGT: Protectors?
Roi: You have heard of the problems with the Japanese fishing
fleet off Aotearoa? We rode with the protestors and eco-
activists and now with the navy. We will not let them strip our
seas as they have done in the Philippines.
NGT: That sounds very political. Is that part of being of a hero
of legend?
Roi: You make fun, and you are missing the point. It doesn't
matter if I can speak to a whale or ride it into the depths, it
doesn't matter that I don't feel the chill of the ocean, that I can
swim faster and hold my breath longer than any ordinary
human could. That is not power, and that is not why I am a
rider. True power is the ability to change things for the better,
to live up to the traditions and to protect my people and our
land. That is what the whale riders are-forces for change and
guardians of the covenant between man and nature. Without
that, we are nothing.
NGT: Well, thank you for that impassioned explanation and for
your time.
After the break we will return with more on our visit to
enchanting Aotaeroa, the island nation of New Zealand.

ideal self-image is twisted and psychotic rather than positive?
These guys are nasty pieces of work. Really nasty.

be. Every one of them a bloody waste.
· Johnny Zen
. There's no such thing as a "twisted way." They're just adepts
gone psycho.
· Brunnen-G
e It's a chicken and egg argument. Was the adept mentally
unstable or did his powers frag him up? Because of the nature
of their Gift, adepts are far more susceptible than normal peo-
ple to a number of psychological disorders. Every year a few
powerful adepts go barking mad, fooling themselves into
believing they're truly invulnerable or untouchable Nietzschian
supermen. Some end up believing they're more than human.
Above "mere human" laws and morals, they lose their sense of
humanity and become cold and psychopathic.
· Socio Pat
. The truly dangerous ones are unstable but don't show it. The
ones that get a kick out of causing pain and damage but write
it off as cold-bloodedness. True pros to the rest of us, fragged-
up every which way on the inside.

everyone thought were caused by a rogue vamp? Turned out
the crazy son-of-a-slitch behind it was an adept, completely

bathed in a victim's blood! Took a full team of Star SWAT to put
him down in the end.

BROTHERS IN ARMS
In the next section I'll be briefly introducing a few adept
groups with distinctly different profiles to give you a general
idea of how varied this aspect of "adept culture" really is. Given
who'll be reading this upload, I've tried to keep things relevant
and I'll be covering groups that are rumored to have, shall we
say, a shadowy side.
Despite all their superhuman abilities, adepts are ulti-
mately just gifted metahumans, and metahumans are still
social animals who congregate with like-minded individuals
for social, intellectual and professional reasons. Like magi-
cians, adepts take advantage of the fact that many such
groups naturally combine secular functions and agendas with
initiatory practices or dedicated beliefs. Some groups give
preference to adepts who follow a specific way, others allow
any adept who shares their agenda or dedication and yet
others have no membership restrictions, allowing both
adepts and other magical types, operating for all intents and
purposes as standard magical groups. Some groups stand
alone, others operate under the umbrella of a bigger organi-
zation. Regardless of their form and goals, they are essential
elements of adept society and represent safe refuges from
the bigotry and exclusion that mainstream culture still levels
against certain adept types.
EXPERIMENTAL TROUPE SIX
Next up I'd like to introduce an off-beat group that is still
making waves despite being past its prime. Experimental
Troupe 6, known as the Cohen clique in artistic circles, was
formed around the vanguard gurus and patrons of the arts
Anthony and Lillian Cohen back in '32. Tony became famous as
the lead vocalist for alternative novastars Efemero, while Lillian
was a ground-breaking installation artist. Fabulously successful
in the turbulent American arts scene in the Twenties, the cou-
ple poured a lot of their wealth into helping out emerging
artists-especially adepts. They were spurred on by Juan
Gardel, star of the Modignani Dance company, live-in "friend"
and adept dancer.
0 | can't even count the number of times the neighbors called
the Star because of the noise and disturbances. Not that they
ever did anything; the Cohens are too well connected.

· The parties are no longer as wild and loud as they used to be.
Both the Cohens have gone quiet and introspective in their old
age. Tony has retired from public life, though Lillian still puts on
the odd show. Her productions still rock.
· Arty Nouveau
The Cohen art soirees held at their Everett (Seattle) open
space gallery and loft were a cultural event not to be missed on
par with Warhol's Factory. From music to sculpture to avant-
garde sim-experiences, the Cohen shows had it all, earning a
rep for introducing a crop of talented adepts to rich connois-
seurs and patrons. To help their protégés-and themselves-
to reach their full potential, the Cohens decided to form an ini-
tiatory group: Experimental Troupe 6 (so named for its six
founding members).
. Maybe somebody would like to comment on Lillian's over-
fondness for Tantric Centering? Or the group's use of BTLs to
reach "higher states" during initiations?
· Auntie Acid
· There's always someone to sling mud at what they don't
understand. The Cohens and ExTSix have inspired a genera-
tion of cutting-edge acts across the arts spectrum. If it wasn't
for them, you'd never have heard of Karjevich, Romero or
Luna Gora.
Allison K.
. While the Cohens are infamous for living it up, I know for a
fact they're protective of their little group. They've been known
to hire shadow talent to guard aspiring artists and even to
teach the odd unscrupulous gallery owner a lesson or two.
· Six
· Way I heard it, "protective" isn't the word. "Obsessive," maybe.
. Samantha
ExTSix's focus has gradually expanded to include the pro-
motion of other Awakened arts, through trend-setting multi-
media shows and events. These days the group's successful
(and now-wealthy) ever-renewing membership raises funds in
support of artists and art projects, manages local and traveling
art shows with a rotating roster of artists, and promotes art
education at the high school and university levels.
. Tony can't be too happy with the pics of Lillian facehugging
hunky rock star Gato all over the scandalsheets last month. By
the by, Gato's an adept too, with some serious moves on stage
and a voice you wouldn't believe.

talked to them a coupla times, seemed nice, but I can't say
one way or another. But I slept over at the Loft the night my
(in)significant other went through an initiation. I shouldn't
have, but I crept down to the gallery where they held all their
dos and peeked. Lilian and Gardel were dancing stark naked
in a pool of weird glowing mist. My SO was sprawled on the
floor while the other members sat zoned out in a circle. The
mist kept rolling about, as if there was a breeze, and abstract
images flickered in and out of focus, When I shifted to the
astral for a look-see, I almost crapped my pants. I've since
seen bug queens, toxics and even fey, but that avatar is still in
the top three weirdest spirits I've ever come across.

GLADIO
Gladio is an example of adepts coming together in reac-
tion to bias and segregation, in this case in professional sports.
Adepts in personal combat sports have long suffered from dis-
crimination; their abilities are banned in a number of different
leagues and championships, either removing them from gen-
eral rankings or restricting them to showcase bouts.
· Understatement of the decade. No adepts are allowed in
the Olympics and most world championships. When they are
allowed to participate it's only in separate leagues, not
much different from African-American athletes back at the
start of the twentieth century. Even in augmented sports, use
of magical abilities is looked down upon, and the media spin
in some places is that we're somehow cheating when we use
our natural talents.
. John Bull
· Too true. A number of urban brawl and combat bike teams
keep their adepts as benchwarmers, trotting them out for the
ratings when the crowd is pro-magic biased.
· Brick
There are those of us that think sport should be about skill,
mental and physical prowess, and not an enhancement arms
race. Magic, cyber or drugs, it's all cheatin' the game. Why
don't you find your own Special Olympics and leave the real
deal to true athletes?
· Hawks Fan
In '59, James Royce, a former Kumité champion,
brought a number of adepts together as an initiatory group
for professional fighters, calling it Gladio. About a year later,
the group began pooling its resources, raising funds and
establishing itself as a force to be reckoned with in pro
sports. Royce and company showed exceptional business
savvy, investing their winnings and savings to buy out the
flagging Ultimate Fighting Championship franchise, which
was losing ground to tridcast blood sport channels. With
Gladio assuming management, it was opened up to both
magically enhanced and cyber-augmented competitors and
has since become the premiere combat sport show with

broadcasting deals in 120 countries and several multi-million
nuyen licensing and marketing deals.
. Despite the broadcasts, most UFC fights sell out days before
the event. All fighting styles are allowed and contestants are
organized by weight class. Some offensive cyber and lethal
adept abilities are forbidden, but otherwise it's a free-for-all
until the opponent is either KOed or bows out.
· Cannonball
In recent months, the lucrative franchise now boasting
American, Asian and European leagues has come under inves-
tigation by the feds for its ties to several underworld rackets. So
far, no conclusive evidence against Gladio has come up, but the
authorities are investigating the conspicuous disappearance of
several Gladio prize-fighters. Rumor is that some of the real
hardcore brawlers are playing the underground pit fight circuits
on the side for extra cash. Pit fights are far more brutal, fatalities
are not uncommon, and the local syndicates often run the oper-
ations. Death fights are especially appreciated and the winner
can walk away with huge profits. Gladio's high membership
fees and enormous profits allow it to bring in some serious legal
talent. But if the feds dig up proof, they're in real trouble.
. This Elan guy is full of crap. The UFC Is clean. This isn't the first
time there have been false allegations, and it won't be the last.

JAMIL ISLAMYAH MONASTERY
I thought long and hard before adding this group. The
main reason, to be perfectly honest, is that most of my knowl-
edge of this group comes from word-of-mouth. I think it might
be enlightening, however, since I have mentioned the exis-
tence of myriad cultural ways and the fact that not all cultures
view magic in the same way. This is particularly visible in
State of the Art: 2064
55

Page 50:
NOVATECH
THE PATH OF THE ROEPT .
Islamic cultures, where traditional hermetic or shamanic magic
is often misunderstood-while, ironically, followers of the Inner
Path are seen as touched by Allah, their somatic powers sim-
ply God's gifts to his mujahidin (holy warriors).
. There were cruzados too, during the Euro Wars. Most were
Christian zealots all too common here in Spain, but several
became famous on the Andalucian front. Nowadays, I've
begun to suspect a few were New Templars too. Pardon my
magical ignorance, but I'm wondering if there's any real differ-
ence between these crusaders and the mujahidin other than
they follow different faiths?
· Sepherim
Jamil Islamyah is not a sect, but a conservative Sunni
movement within the Islamic community, a brotherhood of
missionaries, ulemas (teachers) and "evangelists" that has been
around for about a hundred years and whose influence once
spanned the globe. The group was one of the Alliance for
Allah's main pillars and has never truly recovered its former
status since the Alliance disintegrated. Seeking a new direc-
tion, its leaders were confronted with the notion that the
destruction of Tehran, the Alliance's failure and the mysterious
assassination of mullah Sayid Jazrir might have had different
outcomes had Islam been ready to fight fire with fire.
Islamyah's leaders were aware that the Islamic world was
lagging behind in the magical arms race and decided to under-
take a concerted program to correct this. It was understood
that they were treading a dangerously fine line that might bring
the ire of their former allies down upon them. In 2041, how-
ever, Islamyah established the first of five dedicated monastery
madrassas (schools) near Medina and sent out the call for
Islamic magicians and adepts alike to prove their faith and
devotion by coming to train there to serve Allah. The first class
of magical mujahidin came out of the Aleppo citadel madras-
sas in '47.
. Each new class forms its own magic group. Each group num-
bers between five to eight mujahidin and is led by an ulema.
Groups combine magicians and adepts and train intensively to
work together as a formidable force. Such groups almost never
divide, taking assignments together and returning to the
monasteries to assume the role of experienced teachers when
the group loses too many companions.
· Sayyid
In 2061, following the reunification of Arabia, Jamil
Islamyah's leaders swore allegiance to Ibn Eisa's Islamic Unity
Movement and began providing men to aid the IUM's plans for
the Middle East.
. Ibn Eisa's infamous Jinn bodyguards-the ones that failed him
in Makka-were a group of mujahidin from Aleppo. I hear the
current ones are too, which explains their rumored magical tal-
ents.
· Finis
. Ironically enough, many of the practices and training used in
the madrassas follow the Sufi teachings that modern Sunnis so
often revile.
· Suleiman
THE SISTERS OF EGLANTINE
In case the name Eglantine isn't familiar to you, she's a
leading member of Mutter Erde, an international policlub with
an intense feminist agenda. The Sisters of Eglantine haven't
been together for long, and yet in five short years have estab-
lished a network of over fifty female adepts dedicated to the
deity they call the Goddess. The network operates twenty-
three known branches in cities worldwide, with headquarters in
four major sprawls: Seattle, Atlanta, Los Angeles and Chicago.
The leadership of the group, exclusively adepts, aggressively
recruits mundane volunteers to aid and support the group's
social agenda. Though rumors suggest more branches and
members, none have been officially confirmed.
On the surface, the group's mission statement seems fair-
ly straightforward: promote womanhood, bring faith and hope
to the streets of every community, while helping folks turn
their lives around for the better, particularly those that live on
the streets and suffer from "addiction, starvation or hopeless-
ness." They believe that politicians and local governments do
not work hard enough to better the lives of the destitute and
impoverished, so someone must. The group's leadership
boasts several strong, well-educated, articulate leaders, includ-
ing Sister Agatha Harello. Sister Harello and several other
Sisters are adepts of the speaker's way.
. Shades of the Universal Brotherhood, anyone? I'm not going
anywhere near these chicks. Feminists, self-righteous, Wiccans
to boot ...
· Skeptic
· Drek, I'm sick of the unofficial Shadowrunner Boys' Club
around here. Where do I sign up?
· Patricide Girl
Having been privileged to access confidential files on the
group, it appears the Sisters' activities stretch well beyond the
scope of friendly community service when strong resistance is
encountered. More than one report suggests the Sisters have
targeted offending gangs to remove them permanently from
the neighborhood.
0 | can confirm that. These Sisters are not above buying-out turf
or hiring deniable assets to remove entrenched "undesirables"
from a neighborhood.
e Difool
They've also legally purchased numerous seemingly
worthless plots of land, riddled with dilapidated, uninhabited
buildings or ruined and abandoned structures. With diligent
work and hired hands, they turn these into community centers
(and safe havens) equipped with gyms, sleeping quarters,
56

NOVATECH
Olympic-size swimming pools and temples-all guarded by
state-of-the-art security and the Sisters themselves.
. Not all of these purchases are strictly legal. They're currently
involved in a legal battle with Weinstein's Developers over two
plots of land they developed but didn't own. Clayton Weinstein
is in protective custody after claiming his life was threatened by
someone representing the Sisters.
· Legal Eagle
Beyond local community activism, the group has a knack for
landing in the headlines with controversial (and sometimes ille-
gal) protests. In one such protest, the group gathered over a hun-
dred local squatters to storm the property of Ingersol-Berkley's
CEO, claiming his plant that bordered their community was
releasing toxins into the local water supply. They invaded his pri-
vate compound, pitched tents and cots and protested all night
long. How did they get past security? The executive claims they
hacked the security network and brought it down minutes before
the protest kicked in and that they also hired a gang, fully armed
with nonlethal weapons, to take out the active security.
Of course, none of this was substantiated by any authori-
ties. The network outage really did occur, as did the gang hit
according to some eyewitnesses, but they were officially
logged as coincidental events.
THE ALEXA GROUP'S SONGBIRDS
On the surface, the Alexa Group isn't very noteworthy.
Publicly, it sponsors scholarship programs and promotes trad-
ing/stock beneficiary programs as educational awards. Its
undisclosed membership roster includes many suits and pro-
fessors who hold teaching positions, work as stockbrokers or
sit on boards of directors. Yawn, right? Well, the interesting bit
is that the scholarship and reward programs Alexa supports are
exclusively for adept students seeking a higher education. Still
yawning, I see. How about this, then? The group's membership
oddly includes a rather high percentage of elves. Ah, now I see
some ears perking up.
It gets better. The FBI intercepted an encrypted file that
hints toward a secret group of adepts within the Alexa Group
known only as the "Songbirds" (don't ask how I got the FBI
file). Given that the leader of this group, an initiated adept
codenamed Lasher, is a former member of the Moonlight
Thorns, it's possible that this group is pursuing some sort of
black ops agenda. The Thorns were Tir paladins, a covert action
team assumed to be working for one of the Tir princes that dis-
banded in '62 following some major fiasco.
. Oakforest, Ni'Fairra and Laverty were the prime suspects
rumored to run the Thorns. Oakforest's currently touring Europe,
but Ni'Fairra and Laverty have been unusually quiet of late.
· Aegis
The purpose of the Songbirds is a major mystery. The feds
seem worried that they're a magical spy agency for the Tir. Some
of the Alexa Group's members make this a possibility. One
member linked to the Songbirds is Livonia Geldon, the founder
and CEO of the multinational advertising agency EarthWyrm
Media and Communications, Inc. That company, responsible for
the Tir's huge tourism campaign, is supposedly a shell-of-a-shell
linked to Prince Jenna Ni'Fairra. Another Alexa member with
rumored ties to the Songbirds is Halpern Nowell, who sits on the
board of directors of Revlup Security. Revlup provides security
for several corporations tied to other Alexa members, including
a small independent archaeological group named Riddlework
Explorers that is suspected of trafficking in the artifacts and relics
black market. There's quite a mystery waiting to be cracked here.
. It should be no surprise at this point that Revlup Security is in
bed with Riddlework Explorers, providing the site and logistics
chain security.

EVOLUTION IN FAST FORWARD
Though low-key and understated compared to advances
in the high-profile field of thaumaturgy, understanding and
developments regarding the abilities of adepts in the past
decade have evolved immensely. Cataloguing programs such
as those established by the Zhengtang Institute and MIT&T
have widened the horizons significantly, both in terms of pre-
viously unidentified power expressions and in entirely new
abilities developed spontaneously but reproducible through
training. In the past couple of years alone, three new metam-
agic techniques and several new foci directly oriented at the
adept community have been patented and licensed. These are
now trickling into common usage; more will certainly follow.
Rather than waste everyone's time trying to do an exhaustive
review of recent developments regarding adepts that I found
interesting, I decided to let others have a say. I posted some
headlines and media clips on a dedicated Magicknet SIG as a
guideline and invited a bunch of friends, acquaintances and
Magicknet regulars to comment. The following is an edit of the
resulting posts. Apologies to those whose comments were cut,
but I kept only those I believed most relevant.
FOCUSING YOUR CENTER
Link: "Focusing Your Center-Expanding the Bounds of
Metamagic Centering" Visionary Academic Journal, July 2064
. For those of you with ADD, here's a summary. Researchers are
now licensing several advanced Centering techniques that
allow adepts exceptional control of certain aspects of their
powers. One enhances somatic control over the body, anoth-
er enhances intellectual faculties, while a third actually allows
the adept to temporarily expand his selection of abilities.
· Scholar
. There's been a lot of interest in this field recently, and I say it's
about damn time! Adept metamagic has been lagging behind
the SOTA for decades. Corporate magic research divisions and
academic magic departments stand to make a killing from the
patents and licensing of new techniques. Adept powers may be

individual, but metamagic can be developed through practice
and training, so the race is on for the next best thing.
· Calleach
Don't get too excited. Many of these "new techniques" are fair-
ly old. They just haven't been in wide circulation. It takes about five
years for stuff to trickle down from the labs to the streets, and many
magicians are traditionalists at heart. Studies in adept magic have
only been catching up recently because corps are catching on
that there's a profitable unexploited market segment out there.
· Acadame
. Wuxing and S-K subsidiaries are leading the field right now.
but MCT is catching up through their partnership with MIT&T. If
these new Centering techniques are being licensed out, you
can bet they've got more tricks being worked on in their thau-
maturgic labs.
· HK Kid
. Not all of them are coming from the halls of academia, no
matter what the eggheads at MIT&T claim. From the descrip-
tions I've read in the specialized press, some of this stuff is stag-
geringly similar to stuff I've seen in the Far East. Mainland
Chinese schools, Indian fakirs, heck, even the islanders down in
the Gulf of Mexico have been using similar techniques for
years. It's undeniable that us Westerners have been slow to
catch on to a lot of cultural and tribal lore. Just last year we
were all hyped up about Channeling, when the Aborigines
have been using it for Ghost knows how long.
· Brin
. That's what it is then! I'd heard the Golden Acorns in Cal Free
were using zen-centering to boost their powers. Now that I think
of it, it sounds like one of these techniques.
· Chico Man
. Some of the best surprises are just next door. For those that
don't know, several NAN magical institutes have an open poli-
cy regarding new advances. They don't license metamagic
techniques, they just charge a steep tutor's fee for teaching
them. The last big breakthrough was last spring when they
made headlines with something they're calling Attunement.
The stuff I heard about was all about animal handling and tun-
ing into critters' minds, but on a stopover in Boston a friend told
me MIT&T's patented a variant that works on cars and stuff.

· This reminds me, there's an exhibit by Lucas Albright at the
Bellevue Grenadier gallery. It's a huge hit and his art is mind-
blowing. Albright is a Puyallup artist done good: he's also an ork
and an adept. In his own unique way, he's contributing to the
ork culture fad. He molds statues from intelligent plastics that
react to the touch with constantly changing low-light emissions
and thermal output. He calls the collection "Captive Auras"

. That's because magic doesn't improve innate artistic vision.
What it can do is enhance a person's ability to express them-

· Folks following the "way of the savant" are what you'd call
mental adepts. Not to be confused with psionicists. Their focus
is honing their minds: developing deductive, perceptive and
intellectual abilities beyond the human norm. From aesthetic
zen masters to intuitive sherlocks, their common knack is over-
coming mental challenges. Of course, this makes them handy
around tech, but what these guys can do puts some geniuses

GAME INFORMATION
The fiction and rules in this chapter were conceived to
complement and flesh out the basic material on adepts in
Shadowrun, Third Edition (SR3) and Magic in the Shadows
(MITS), both of which provide substantial information on a
number of subjects mentioned here.
While the adept character has become a staple of most
shadowrunner teams, he often finds himself limited to specif-
ic combat or stealth-oriented roles, suffering from a two-
dimensional portrayal as a combat monster. The introduction
of new non-combat-oriented ways and powers will hopefully
allow greater character versatility. The following material
introduces a number of new ways, powers, metamagic, foci
and other options that will allow both gamemasters and play-
ers to expand the usual roles of adepts in the game to entire-
ly new fields.
RUNNING WAYS
The material presented above expands and expounds on
some of the better-known adept ways. Many others exist, of
course-those presented here can serve as guidelines. Almost all
adepts follow a way, even if it is sometimes personal and unique.
As explained in MITS, ways represent a unique focus that each
adept develops to improve his body and mind. Ways function as
paths that both reflect the character's personality and guide his
powers and abilities in a specific direction.
Ideally, ways should be seen as more than simply role-
playing guidelines; they reinforce a character's concept and
also provide a framework for the character's development (in
terms of behavior, personality and powers). Gamemasters are
encouraged to let players detail their character's personal
approach to his particular way and actively incorporate this into
the roleplaying aspect of the game, especially in terms of plot
and character development.
The Lost
"Lost" adepts, those who lack a focus because they have
yet to find or lack the drive to follow a particular way, have
greater difficulty and less control in developing their powers. If
a character has yet to find a way or simply does not choose to
go down that path, his magical development may be ham-
pered. Magic in the Sixth World works best-and is less dan-
gerous and random-when given a particular focus.
Gamemasters who feel it necessary to underline this fact
may choose, as an optional rule, to increase the cost of adept
powers by 25 percent for those characters who have strayed
from or simply lack a way. The same might also apply to adepts
who stray from their original way, treading a path that contra-
dicts their outlook and personal convictions. Adepts who lose
their way might even be punished with a loss of powers until
they regain their focus.
NEW ORDEALS
The following ordeals expand on those already available to
adepts for initiation, as outlined on pp. 58-61, MITS.
Masterpiece
A masterpiece ordeal requires the character to spend at least
a month working on an original piece of art. The work must chal-
lenge the artist and requires complete concentration, not allow-
ing for daily activities such as work, study or shadowrunning to
distract the artist. Additionally, the work must be completely orig-
inal. The adept undertaking this ordeal must either know the vir-
tuoso metamagic technique (p. 64) or learn it during the initiation
he is currently undergoing. The adept must also have an appro-
priate art-oriented Knowledge skill. The adept must succeed in
creating a virtuoso piece or the ordeal fails and the artist must
start over. If an artist chooses to perform subsequent masterpiece
ordeals, she must start anew, and the work must have a new
theme that distinguishes it firmly from other works.
Way Ordeal
A way ordeal requires the character and gamemaster to
devise a trial appropriate to advancement in the character's
60

NOVATECH
chosen way. The trial must be a significant step in the charac-
ter's philosophical development along his path. Way ordeals
should require a significant sacrifice of resources, time or even
attribute points, as the gamemaster deems appropriate. Way
ordeals must also have measurable results. Below are some
examples of a way ordeal's trials.
· A follower of the speaker's way must make a groundbreaking
speech appropriate to the character's ambition, whether it
be a televised speech as a keynote speaker advancing a sci-
entific agenda or a political cause or an emotionally charged
counseling session that saves the life of a chiphead or abuse
victim on the brink of suicide-or pulling off a major con rife
with risk.
· A follower of the athlete's way must enter and win a contest
of great significance to the sport or perform in a show con-
sidered to be the premiere performance venue in the field.
· A follower of a cultural way where faith is an important aspect
must earn the respect and admiration of his peers by under-
taking a pilgrimage, publishing an evangelical work or
searching for and recovering a lost religious icon.
NEW METAMAGIC
As an adept develops a better understanding of his gift,
self-knowledge and insight will allow him access to abilities
and metamagic unavailable to other types of magic users. For
instance, magical R&D into Centering has resulted in the dis-
covery of adept-specific advanced Centering metamagic tech-
niques. Some of these grant adepts expanded self-awareness
or enhance different facets of an adept's abilities. Other new
metamagic recently catalogued covers the range from a limit-
ed form of astral projection for magician's way adepts to
enhanced artistic talent.
It's also worth noting that in addition to Centering, Divining,
Masking and the techniques described here, adepts may also
learn the metamagic techniques of Sensing (p.110, Target:
Awakened Lands) and Psychometry (pp. 49-50, SOTA: 2063).
The metamagic techniques listed below are only available
to adepts.
Attunement (Animal, Item)
Throughout history, animal companions and certain sig-
nature items have figured in legends. The Attunement meta-
magic could be said to be the Sixth World's manifestation of
this concept.
In practical terms, Attunement allows the adept to invest
Karma toward establishing a mystical bond with a specific ani-
mal or object-similar to the way he would bond a focus-
granting him a unique affinity with that critter or item. Attuned
animals or items may be used as a material ritual link to the
adept (p. 34, MITS).
Before bonding is possible, Attunement requires the
adept to go through a familiarization process with the animal
or item until handling it is second nature. When familiariza-
tion is complete, a bonding ritual of some sort is needed. The
gamemaster and player should tailor this to the character's
cultural background, belief system and/or way. For instance,
a shamanic adept might best a wild animal in combat to
A NOTE ON ATTUNING ANIMALS
The description of the Attunement (Animal) power
assumes the animal is of a "normal" size (between cat
and horse size). At the gamemaster's discretion, the
adept may be able to bond to a homogenous group of
smaller animals (rats, sparrows, cockroaches, etc.) as if
they were a single animal, requiring a single ritual and
Karma expenditure. The adept may use Sense Link with
any animal from the group (but only one at a time).
Likewise, if the adept wishes to attune to a much
larger animal (elephant, rhino, whale, etc.), the
gamemaster may wish to increase the target number for
the Animal Handling Test as well as the bonding Karma
cost appropriately.
As an optional rule, the gamemaster can allow the
adept to attune to paranormal or cybered critters, but this
should only be allowed after careful consideration. By their
Awakened nature, paranimals are less domesticated, more
resistant to mundane training and simply more powerful.
The same is true for cybered animals that are half-crazed by
implants. Allowing such an attunement can easily threaten
the balance of the game. A gamemaster should only
approve it if it fits the character's development and the
story and the player won't abuse the power. Both the
Animal Handling Test target number and the Karma cost
for bonding should be increased accordingly. As a rule of
thumb, increase both by 1 for each critter power the animal
has and/or each Essence point lost to implants. Especially
potent powers (Essence Drain, Hardened Armor, Magical
Skills, Magic Guard, Regeneration, etc.) may increase both
even more if the gamemaster chooses. The Karma cost for
bonding cybered critters is based on the creature's original
Essence (before implants).
Sentient or even semi-sentient creatures (satyrs, cen-
taurs, merrow, naga, sasquatch, shapeshifters, leshy,
faeries, etc.) can never be attuned to with this power.
become the alpha. A warrior adept might give his weapon a
baptism of blood by cutting himself with the edge. During the
appropriate ritual, the adept sacrifices some of his Good
Karma to attune to the target. Adepts may also perform a
deed ordeal (p. 60, MITS) with the animal or object as a
bonding ritual.
Attunement has different effects depending on whether
the target is an object or animal. Note that Attunement meta-
magic only applies to a either animals or items; if an adept
wants to learn to attune to both animals and itema, he must
learn the metamagic technique twice. A character may only be
attuned to a number of items or animals (total) equal to his
Initiate Grade. He may not receive a bonus from more than one
attuned item/animal in any single action. Attunement may be
voluntarily severed at any moment by the adept (invested
Karma is lost) and is cancelled if the animal dies or the object
is destroyed.

Animals: Animal Attunement allows an adept to bond
with a friendly, mundane, non-sentient animal. To do this,
an adept must first befriend the animal and gain its trust,
requiring an Animal Handling (or similar skill) (5) Test with
a base time of two weeks. Extra successes maybe used to
divide the duration. A failed test means the adept's time
was wasted and he must start again. The process will not
work if the animal is coerced. Once a rapport is established,
the adept may perform the ritual bonding, paying Karma
equal to the animal's Essence.
A bonded animal gains the power of Sense Link (p. 109,
MITS), allowing the adept to experience the world through the
animal's senses. The adept may also issue simple, low-level
telepathic commands to the animal through this link. (These
commands do not automatically succeed, depending on the
disposition of the animal-especially if the command puts the
animal in danger. The gamemaster may call for an Animal
Handling or other appropriate test.) This power has a range
equal to the adept's (Magic + Charisma + Willpower) x 10
meters. If the animal goes beyond this range, contact is lost.
Likewise, if the animal suffers a Moderate Wound or greater
while the power is in use, the link is immediately broken and
the adept suffers Light Stun damage; contact may be re-estab-
lished when the animal is healed.
Items: Attuning a vehicle, weapon or piece of gear
allows an adept amazing intuitive control and uncanny insight
into its operation. An attuned item feels like a physical exten-
sion of the adept's body and makes it easier to perform
incredible feats and difficult stunts. The familiarization
process requires that the adept become thoroughly acquaint-
ed with the item's characteristics and limitations. This entails
a relevant B/R Skill (5) Test (for example, Edged Weapons B/R
for a katana or Bike B/R for a Yamaha Rapier) with a base time
of one week. Alternately, the adept may elect to
build/forge/construct the item from scratch. Success in the
test allows the adept to attune to the item by means of an
appropriate bonding ritual. The Karma cost to bond to an
inanimate object like a vehicle, weapon or other gear equals
the item's Object Resistance (see p. 182, SR3, or the accom-
panying table).
In game terms, Attunement reduces the target number for
any skill tests involving use, control or handling of the item by
1. Attunement, however, provides no bonus when the item is
controlled through a cybernetic interface (VCR, datajack,
smartlink, etc.). Attunement does not aid Magical skills such as
Sorcery, Conjuring, Centering or Enchanting.

Cognition
Cognition can only be learned by adepts who already pos-
sess the Centering technique (p. 72, MITS) and a Centering skill.
Cognition allows an adept to hone and expand his mental,
perceptual and intellectual faculties. It also reflects the charac-
ter's enhanced ability to interact with and comprehend his
environment, as well as his increased mental resilience and
social and intellectual adaptability.
In game terms, Cognition allows the adept to Center for
success or reduce modifiers on Intelligence Tests, including
Perception and Learning Tests. This requires a Free Action. The
adept may also use Centering to reduce modifiers when
defaulting to Intelligence from Intelligence-linked skills.
Cognition also adds one die to the adept's Knowledge and
Language Skill Tests.
Adepts who have learned Cognition have mastered their
own ability to assimilate new knowledge. To reflect this, decrease
the Karma cost to increase skills by 1, to a minimum of one.
Empower Animal Companion
Only adepts who already know the Attunement (Animal)
technique (p. 61) can learn this metamagic.
Empower Animal Companion builds on the bond between
the adept and an attuned animal companion, expanding the
mystic connection between them to allow the adept to share
some of his power and magical abilities with the critter.
To use the Empower Animal Companion technique, the
adept first chooses one of his adept powers and then performs
a ritual similar to the one used originally to attune to the animal.
During this ritual, the adept must pay Karma equal to the power
point cost of the chosen power x 4. This allows the adept to take
a Free Action and temporarily transfer that power to the animal
through the Sense Link. The adept may not use a power himself
while it is transferred to the animal. The adept and animal must
be within the Sense Link power's range.
If the use of a power transferred to the animal calls for a
Skill or Attribute Test, the gamemaster should use the ani-
mal's Reaction as the default skill rating (though Intelligence
and Quickness might also be appropriate) or the animal's rel-
evant attribute.
The adept may conduct similar rituals in order to gain the
ability to transfer additional powers to the critter. The adept
may even empower more than one critter companion, though
a power can never be transferred to more than one animal at a
time. Also, the amount of power points transferred at one time
may never exceed the adept's Initiate Grade (note that this
means an adept may simply be unable to empower an animal
with some of his more costly powers).
Infusion
Infusion can only be learned by adepts who already pos-
sess the Centering technique (p. 72, MITS) and a Centering skill.
Infusion enhances an adept's understanding and com-
mand over both the magic that powers his abilities and his
capacity to channel mana. Infusion allows the adept a measure
of control over his body's own somatic gifts, temporarily
extending the limits of his original powers or even temporarily
manifesting new ones. Such a magic surge has its cost, how-
ever, as adepts suffer temporary burnout afterwards.
To use Infusion metamagic, the adept takes an exclusive
Complex Action and makes a Centering Skill (4) Test. Each suc-
cess grants the adept 0.25 power points that can be used to
either boost an existing power or acquire new powers. The
adept cannot score more successes than his Initiate Grade. The
adept may purchase only one level of a power he does not
already possess. These enhanced/new powers can be used for
(Magic attribute x Initiate Grade) minutes, after which they fade.
As soon as the power boost ends, the adept immediately
suffers Drain equal to (Centering successes)S. This Drain is Stun
damage, resisted by Willpower, and reflects the body's fatigue
from channeling increased levels of mana. In addition, the
adept loses the same number of power points' worth of pow-
ers for a period equal to the number of minutes the temporary
powers were in effect. The gamemaster chooses what powers
are temporarily "burned out"-the adept should not know a
power is inaccessible until he tries to use it.
An adept should always be able to increase the level of a
power he possesses, but the selection of new powers is limit-
ed by the Initiate's Grade in power points, to prevent it from
being an all-purpose adept power. The gamemaster can either
ask the player to choose one power point worth of available
powers each time he initiates or note a power each time it is
temporarily gained by this metamagic and cut it off when the
total reaches the adept's Initiate Grade; from then on, the
selection is limited to powers previously chosen.
Limited Astral Projection
Only magician's way adepts who already know the Astral
Perception power may learn this metamagic technique.
Limited Astral Projection allows a magician's way adept to
astrally project in the same manner as full magicians (p. 172,
SR3). Since the adept's magical abilities are firmly rooted in his
physical body, however, the adept's physical body loses
Essence at the rate of 1 point every minute rather than every
hour (see While You Were Out ... , p. 173, SR3). Adept pow-
ers function normally while the adept is projecting.
Somatic Control
Somatic Control can only be learned by adepts who
already possess the Centering technique (p. 72, MITS) and a
Centering skill.
The Somatic Control technique embodies the adept's
progress in both awareness and control of his own body and
physicality. This advanced metamagic represents the purest
distillation of his somatic gift and grants an adept greater con-
trol of his physiological abilities, allowing him to better under-
stand and overcome his physical limitations and even to
enhance his attributes beyond their normal ranges for brief
periods of time. The most obvious effect of this technique is the
temporary redistribution of the body's resources to enhance
certain Physical attributes at the expense of others.
In game terms, the adept can shunt points between attrib-
utes, raising one by lowering another. To use this technique,
the character takes an exclusive Complex Action and makes a
State of the Art: 2064

NOVATECH
Centering Skill (4) Test. The maximum number of points that
may be shifted between Physical attributes is equal to the num-
ber of successes scored. The adept cannot score more success-
es than his Initiate Grade. This change in attributes lasts for up
to (Magic attribute x Initiate Grade) minutes, after which they
revert to normal levels and cannot be shifted again for 10 x the
number of minutes they were modified.
The body's reallocation of resources makes trained skills
less effective, however, decreasing an affected attribute's
linked skills. For every point an attribute is decreased, decrease
all linked skills higher than the new value by 1.
Radical bodily changes of this sort are strenuous. After the
attributes return to normal, the adept maybe suffer from
painful cramps and muscle sprains. To reflect this, the adept
must make a Damage Resistance Test using Body against Stun
damage with a Power equal to the number of attribute points
shifted. The Damage Level is Serious if an attribute was boost-
ed above the Racial Maximum, Moderate if an attribute was
boosted above the Racial Modified Limit, and Light otherwise.
Note that changes to an adept's Quickness may affect
Reaction, Initiative and Combat Pool. Temporarily shifted attrib-
utes do not affect the Karma cost of skills or learning.
Virtuoso
Initiated artist adepts created this metamagic technique. An
adept using this metamagic focuses all of his artistic skill into the
creation/composition of a piece of art, pouring talent and magic
into the creation and attempting to forge something truly sub-
lime. The technique only works on original and inspired artworks.
The resulting creations are truly magical masterpieces. Fueled by
the adept artist's enhanced creative talent, each virtuoso piece
possesses a singular and powerful aura, one that is almost intox-
icating to astrally perceive such that even mundanes find it
immensely emotional. Both physical works of art and perfor-
mance pieces can be virtuoso creations.
In game terms, to produce a virtuoso creation an adept
must make a Skill (9) Test using an appropriate artistic
Knowledge skill (Composition, Dancing, Drawing, Painting,
Poetry, Sculpting, etc.) with a base time of one month. A num-
ber of dice equal to the adept's Initiate Grade may be added to
the test. The successes indicate the rating of the virtuoso piece;
alternately, some successes may be used to reduce the base
time. Good Karma may be used to increase the piece's rating at
the time of creation at a rate of one additional point per 2 Karma
invested (Karma spent cannot exceed the creator's artistic skill).
The completed artwork generates a Background Count equal to
the piece's rating, charged with an emotion appropriate to the
piece. This Background Count is aspected to the creator adept
and does not interfere with him.
Virtuoso performance art must first be composed by the
adept, as described above. Each time the adept performs the
virtuoso piece, he must succeed in a Skill (6) Test using the
appropriate
performance
skill
to
evoke
the
emotional/Background Count effect of the piece. The
gamemaster should decide the roleplaying side effects of the
piece's emotionally charged Background Count, which affects
both the astral and physical planes.
Virtuoso pieces have been known to inspire mesmerizing
awe in those who experience them for the first time. Apply the
effects of Enthralling Performance (p. 65) to any character view-
ing such a virtuoso artwork or performance (add the adept's
Initiate Grade to the Open Test).
Both physical and performance virtuoso artworks are high-
ly sought after for their artistic and collector's value-especially
by Awakened collectors. Material pieces are occasionally
sought because they are useful in enchanting-such virtuoso
items can be considered exotic materials for enchanting. The
piece is not destroyed during enchanting, however, but
becomes integral to the final product, which will likely earn the
enchanter the artist's wrath.
Physical virtuoso art also acts as a material link (see p. 34,
MITS) to the creator.
NEW POWERS
The following new adept powers are available to adept char-
acters. At the gamemaster's discretion, they may be learned at
character creation or by standard character advancement.
Aid Spell
Cost: 0.5 per level
Aid Spell allows an adept to channel her inner magic so that
a magician may tap into it to aid his spellcasting. Physical contact
between the adept and spellcaster is necessary. The adept must
take an exclusive Complex Action and concentrate on acting as a
conduit for mana. This power allows the adept to provide one die
per level to a magician that is casting a spell in the same Initiative
Phase. Each use of Aid Spell requires the adept to make a Drain
Test using Willpower (mana spells) or Body (physical spells)
against (spell Force + 2)M Stun.
Animal Empathy
Cost: 0.25 per level
An adept with Animal Empathy has a natural affinity for han-
dling animals. Each level adds +1 die for any skill tests involving
the non-threatening handling of animals or attempts to threaten
or frighten an animal.
Commanding Voice
Cost: 0.5
This power channels magic into the modulation of the
adept's voice. As a result, the weight and importance of the
adept's words subliminally influence targeted listeners. An
adept with Commanding Voice may make take a Complex
Action and issue a forceful but simple order (three words or
less) to another character. The adept pits his Charisma against
the target's Willpower in an Opposed Test. For each additional
individual past the first, the adept suffers a +1 target number
modifier. If the adept wins, the target character takes his next
available Free or Simple Action to either obey the adept or
pause in indecision (gamemaster's call). The order does not
carry any weight beyond that immediate impetus, however, and
determined characters will immediately go about doing what
they originally meant to do. This power is useful for temporari-
ly distracting or flustering opponents.
State of the Art: 2064

NOVATECH
Commanding Voice may only be used on metahumans
who can directly hear and understand the adept. It does not
work when the voice is amplified or transmitted via techno-
logical means (bullhorn, loudspeakers, etc.). It is less effective
on subsequent uses; apply a cumulative +2 modifier each
additional time an adept tries to use Commanding Voice on
the same character within a 24-hour period.
Cool Resolve
Cost: 0.5 per level
An adept with Cool Resolve has a confident and unflap-
pable presence in social situations. This power protects the
adept from being manipulated, fooled or intimidated by oth-
ers. The adept receives one die per level for resisting the use
of Charisma-linked social skills against him. This power does
not protect against spells or critter powers, but it does func-
tion against other adept powers.
Deep Rooting
Cost: 0.5
Deep Rooting is an advanced version of the Rooting
power (p. 151, MITS). It has the same effects as one level of
Rooting and additionally allows the adept to root himself in
place so thoroughly that he acts as a highly stable firing plat-
form. Deep Rooting reduces all recoil penalties by half (round
down). The adept has a firing arc of 90 degrees to the front
and may only turn up to 90 degrees per action. Disengaging
Deep Rooting is a Complex Action. (Note that the Rooting
power is not a prerequisite for Deep Rooting.)
Eidetic Sense Memory
Cost: 0.5
An adept with Eidetic Sense Memory has a photograph-
ic sight memory in addition to a very keen memory for nois-
es, smells, the way textures feel, the way foods taste and so
on. The adept can always remember these senses and recall
what or who they are in future encounters. Adepts with this
power can also photo-read, greatly increasing the rate at
which text can be read.
Elemental Strike
Cost: 0.5
Elemental Strike can only be purchased by adepts who
already know the Killing Hands power.
Elemental Strike allows an adept to channel his power
into creating a secondary elemental effect (see p. 51, MITS)
when he strikes a target with Killing Hands. The specific ele-
mental effect is chosen when this power is purchased. When
the power is active, it appears as a visible effect around the
adept's hands or feet. Creating the elemental effect requires
a Simple Action, and it remains in effect for (Magic attribute)
Combat Turns or until the adept uses a Free Action to extin-
guish it.
Elemental Strike may not be used with Distance Strike or
Delay Damage.
Empathic Healing
Cost: 1
An adept may heal another person by transferring some or
all of that person's wounds onto himself. The adept makes a
Magic Test against a target number equal to 10 - the target's
Essence (round down). The number of successes determines the
maximum number of damage boxes that can be transferred. The
base time for this process depends upon the wound level trans-
ferred (use the Permanent Spell Base Time table, p. 128, SR3).
Extra successes may be used to reduce the base time.
The adept must maintain physical contact with the wounded
character during this entire process. Only Physical damage can be
transferred in this manner.
Empathic Reading
Cost: 0.25 per level
An adept with Empathic Reading has a greater ability to
determine if a target is telling the truth or imparting factual infor-
mation. The adept is sensitive to the unconscious physical body
language and biological signs a person exhibits while trying to lie.
The adept receives a-1 target number modifier per level to deter-
mine if a target is lying. To determine if a character is lying, the
adept makes an Intelligence Test against the lying character's
Negotiation Open Test-Empathic Reading reduces the result of
the Open Test by 1 per level for the adept.
Enhanced Balance
Cost: 0.5 (Level 1) or 1 (Level 2)
Enhanced Balance increases an adept's balance for athletic
maneuvers such as climbing, tight-rope walking, gymnastics and
so on. Each level of Enhanced Balance reduces the target num-
ber for any Physical Skill Test involving balance or Knockdown
Test by 1.
Enthralling Performance
Cost: 0.5
An adept must have an artistic performance Knowledge Skill
(Dancing, Oration, Singing, etc.) to purchase this power. The
power only applies to that select performance skill (Enthralling
Performance must be purchased separately if the adept would
like to use it for more than one Knowledge Skill).
This power channels magic into the adept's performance,
mesmerizing the audience with the flow of his movements or the
cadence of his words and putting the audience at ease.
Enthralling Performance induces a mild hypnotic state in the audi-
ence. The adept makes an Open Test using the appropriate per-
formance skill. Any audience members who fail to beat the Open
Test with a Willpower Test give the adept their full, unwavering
attention. While mesmerized, such characters suffer a +4 distrac-
tion modifier to Perception Tests (rather than the usual +2 for dis-
traction). Entranced audience members who are subject to an act
of stress (such as being knocked over or threatened) or obtrusive
environmental distractions (like a gunshot) will automatically
break out of the trance. The maximum period the adept can keep
others entranced is equal to his Charisma x 10 in minutes.

Facial Sculpt
Cost: 1
An adept can change her facial features through slight shifts
in musculature, bone, cartilage and skin angles for a number of
hours equal to her Magic attribute. Use of Facial Sculpt requires
(10 - Willpower) minutes of concentration. The adept makes an
Open Magic Test to determine the target number that observers
use on Perception Tests to recognize her. Examples of changes
include raising or lowering the cheek bones, thickening or thin-
ning of the lips, stretching
the eyelids, altering the angle
or height of the ears, squar-
ing or rounding the chin or
drawing up or fattening of

Gliding
Cost: 1
Gliding allows an adept
to run up to (Magic attribute) meters across tangible surfaces
that would not normally support his weight, such as water, thin
ice or a fragile tree limb. Any attempt to run longer distances
requires break points or landings and multiple uses of Gliding.
Any attempt to use this power with acrobatics (such as jump-
ing from the surface) will require an Athletics Test against a tar-
get number established by the gamemaster and is considered
a difficult maneuver. The secondary effects of the adept's
motion still occur, such as sound or vibrations (leaves shake
and water ripples). This power may be combined with Traceless
Walk to remove the secondary effects of the adept's motion.
Improved Ability (Expanded)
Improved Ability is described on p.169, SR3. Increasing
numbers of adepts, however, have learned to expand the limits
of this ability through training, practice and natural talent beyond
its original scope, so that it is now applicable to other skills. The
expanded skills are listed on the Improved Ability (Expanded)
Table with their associated costs.
Inertia Strike
Cost: 0.5
An adept with this power performs a powerful melee or
unarmed attack channeling energy into knocking the opponent
off of his feet. The base Damage Level of the attack is reduced by
one, but the opponent must make a Knockdown Test (even if no

(Level 3)
An adept with Kinesics

has complete control over his
body's nonverbal and subcon-
scious communication and social
cues, even when engaged in stressful social scenarios. This con-
trol includes facial expressions, body movements, posture, eye
movements and internal biological stress functions such as heart-
beat, blood pressure and sweat glands. The adept is also gifted at
reading others' body language and cultural-specific affectations
and mimicking their cues to his advantage. As a result, this power
boosts the character's natural presence and social charms.
Each level reduces the adept's target number for Etiquette
and Negotiation Tests by 1 to a minimum target number of 2. The
adept also adds 1 die per level to any social situation Charisma
Success Tests the character makes. Additionally, apply a +2 mod-
ifier per level to any test to discover whether the adept is lying or
not (including magic and technological tests).
Two adepts with Kinesics and within sight of each other can
use a Complex Action to nonverbally communicate simple
notions to each other, using body language alone. Only basic
messages and emotional states can be conveyed: yes, no, I don't
want to, I'm angry, look out behind you and so on.
Linguistics
Cost: 0.25
Linguistics allows an adept to absorb a new language in a
very short time by exposure to it. Only (10 - Magic attribute) hours
of exposure to the language are required to learn it. At the end of
66

this time, the adept makes an Intelligence Test against an
appropriate target number as noted on the Linguistics Table.
If successful, the adept gets the Language skill at Rating 1 at
no Karma cost. Increasing the skill costs the standard amount,
but reduce the base learning time for the adept by half.
Living Focus
Cost: 1
Living Focus allows an adept to channel mana into her
own body in order to sustain a spell cast on her (an effect sim-
ilar to a sustaining focus). Thereafter, the magician that cast
the spell does not need to sustain the spell. The adept, how-
ever, suffers the usual +2 modifier for sustaining the spell. The
Force of the sustained spell cannot exceed the adept's Magic
attribute. Only one spell may be sustained at a time in this fashion.
Melanin Control
Cost: 0.25
An adept with Melanin Control has the ability to alter his hair
or skin color within the limits of natural skin tone for the character's
metatype for a number of hours equal to his Magic attribute. Use
of Melanin Control requires a Complex Action to shift either hair
or skin color one grade. There are four standard grades of skin
color: albino, tan, brown and black. There are four standard grades
of hair color: white/gray, blonde, red/brown, black. Therefore, to
shift albino skin to black requires three Complex Actions.
Motion Sense
Cost: 0.5
An adept, through magical sensory perception of minute
disturbances in the surrounding mana, can unconsciously detect
the presence of objects, people or animals that move within
Magic attribute meters, even when sight, sound or smell detect
nothing. An adept makes a Perception Test against the appropri-
ate target number given on the Motion Sense Table or against the
result of the target's Open Stealth Test (if stealthing); apply a tar-
get number modifier equal to any Background Count present.
Only one success is needed to detect the movement. If a target
is detected, the adept receives a -2 reduction to any visibility
modifiers to strike at it (so an invisible target, normally +8 to
strike, would only be at +6 to hit for the adept). This sense can-
not detect movement on the other side of astral barriers.
Multi-Tasking
Cost: 0.5
Multi-tasking grants the adept the ability to gather informa-
tion from multiple senses simultaneously and also to concentrate
on two separate actions/thoughts at the same time. The adept
may use two Free Actions per Initiative Phase. For example, an
adept can read data off a vid-screen and simultaneously listen to
the commlink, providing full attention and focus to each.
Nimble Fingers
Cost: 0.5
Nimble Fingers allows the adept to perform simple reflex
and timing tricks more efficiently and effectively. It grants the
adept +1 die to Stealth or Quickness Tests that involve sleight-

of-hand actions. Additionally, Insert Clip, Pick Up/Put Down
Object, Remove Clip and Use Simple Object are Free Actions
for the adept.
Pain Relief
Cost: 1
Pain Relief allows an adept to channel energy into his
hands and apply it to chakra points on another target (the
adept cannot use Pain Relief on himself). Used in many Asian
techniques like Reiki, acupuncture and Shiatsu massage, this
technique allows the adept to dissipate fatigue, stress, muscle
tension and pain. To represent this energy manipulation, the
adept makes a Magic Test against a target number equal to (10
- the target's Essence), rounded down. Success reduces the
target's Stun damage by one level (i.e., from Serious to
Moderate). The technique requires a base time of 30 minutes
of uninterrupted concentration (divided by the number of suc-
cesses) and requires the adept to maintain skin contact with
the target. Pain Relief can be used to alleviate Drain.
Penetrating Strike
Cost: 0.75 (Level 1), 1.5 (Level 2) or 2.25 (Level 3)
An adept with this power channels great force a short dis-
tance forward while making an unarmed melee attack, thereby
bypassing a target's Impact armor. Each level of Penetrating Strike
allows an adept to reduce the target's Impact armor by 1 for the
purposes of determining damage only. This power may be com-
bined with Killing Hands, but not Distance Strike.
Resilience
Cost: 0.25 per level
An adept with Resilience has the natural power to stabilize
Deadly Wounds and minimize secondary effects associated with
extreme wounds such as severed or maimed limbs, cracked bones
or heart attack. The adept gains +1 die per level for his stabilization
tests (see Deadly Wounds and First Aid, p. 129, SR3). The adept
also receives an extra die per level when checking for permanent
damage resulting from Deadly Wounds (see Deadly Wounds and
Permanent Damage, p. 127, SR3). Additionally, the adept reduces
the target number by -1 per level when testing for wound effects
(see Determining Wound Effects, p. 126, Man & Machine).
Side Step

An adept with Side Step can read the subtleties of motion
and body language to anticipate the timing and location of a

one additional Combat Pool die only for the purposes of Dodge

Sprint
Cost: 0.25 per level
An adept with this ability has refined her muscular control
and force of surface contact to increase running speed. Every
level of Sprint grants an adept +1 Quickness for determining run-
ning distance.
Sustenance
Cost: 0.25
An adept with Sustenance replenishes the same amount of
energy and health from three hours of sleep and one solid meal
a day as a normal person would with eight hours of sleep and
three meals a day. Additionally, the adept's body processes food
and drink very efficiently, and therefore the adept requires only
one trip to the restroom each day.
Three-Dimensional Memory
Cost: 0.5
An adept with three-dimensional memory can memorize an
area viewed first-hand in exact, three-dimensional detail by per-
forming a Complex Action. At a later date, the adept may make
a Perception Test to mentally walk through the area, searching
and exploring as if the adept were walking through the scene for
the first time. Nothing in the scene can be disturbed or manipu-
lated in the memory, and an adept only recalls things he actually
saw or sensed, even if incidentally. For example, the adept can-
not remember what is within a desk drawer unless the drawer
was open when the adept memorized the area. Each individual
area memorized in this manner can be no greater than the
adept's (Magic attribute in square meters. An adept may memo-
rize a number of areas equal to his Magic attribute.
The target number of the Perception Test is modified by the
elapsed amount of time since the memory was "captured," as
noted on the Three-Dimensional Memory Table.
Voice Control
Cost: 0.5
An adept with Voice Control has an amazing level of control
over the properties of her voice. The adept can change her voice's
pitch, modulation and tone at will, as well as increase her volume.
This allows the adept to mask her voice and imitate sounds with-
in the normal range of metahuman vocalization (i.e., no infrasound
or ultrasound), including mimicking the voices of others.
This trick can be used to defeat voice recognition systems.
Use the adept's Intelligence in an Opposed Test against
the system's rating, or against the Intelligence of other
characters the adept is attempting to fool. Voice Control
also allows an adept to "throw" her voice up to (Magic
attribute) meters away.
Wall Running
Cost: 1
Wall Running allows an adept to move up to (Magic
attribute) meters on a sheer wall or vertical surface. Any attempt
to run higher distances requires break points or landings and mul-
tiple uses of Wall Running. Any attempt to use this power with
acrobatics (such as jumping from one wall to another) will require
an Athletics Test against a target number established by the
gamemaster and should be considered a difficult maneuver. The
secondary effects of the adept's motion still occur, such as sound
or tracks, though this power may be combined with Traceless
Walk to remove such secondary effects.
NEW FOCI
The following new foci are available to adepts.
Adept Focus
This focus is a variant of the power focus specifically
designed (and only of use to) adepts. It increases the bonded
adept's effective Magic attribute by its Force. This does not grant
adepts additional power points, but does affect the amount they
can have active at a time, as well as affecting tests, ranges, etc
that use the adept's current Magic attribute. The adept focus also
grants dice equal to its Force for the adept's Drain Resistance
Tests, but it does not affect whether Drain is Stun or Physical.
Costs (both nuyen and bonding) are the same as a spirit focus of
the same force.
Infusion Focus
An infusion focus allows the adept bonded to it to tap into
his inner potential and activate a specific adept power that he
does not normally possess. An infusion (Combat Sense 2) focus,
for example, would give the adept the power of Combat Sense 2
for as long as the focus was bonded and active. Infusion foci are
dedicated to a specific power, and an adept who knows that
power must participate in the enchanting process. Likewise,
when an adept bonds the focus, another adept who knows the
power must be present to teach him how to use the focus to
unleash it.
The rating of the infusion focus must be equal to the power's
point cost x 2 (So a Combat Sense 2 infusion focus would be
Rating 4). Powers gained by an infusion focus count towards the
total number of powers an adept may have active at one time.
The Magical Power (p. 22. MITS) may not be activated through
use of an infusion focus.
Costs (both nuyen and bonding) are the same as a spell cat-
egory focus of the same force. Infusion foci tend to be rare and
hard to find, however, so their Availability is 8/72 hours.

Seeing as I'm on your side of the law these days, I thought I'd make it easier on the two
or three slags out there that'd love to go about their business without having bullets slung at
'em. Law enforcement is a tough nut to crack. At the center of it you have an army of under-
paid foot soldiers whose primary job is to hold back the sea of corruption and violence that
threatens to drown the cities they've sworn to protect. Each officer steps into the field know-
ing that today could be the day they lose their life. What we as shadowrunners don't really
consider is that those same officers have families to come home to and they are willing to do
absolutely anything it takes to make sure it happens. That may mean some fragile justices get
abused in the process.

ideals. There's no measuring of integrity or empathy. So instead you get the men who were

some of them may start off with good intentions or romanti-
cized notions from watching cops on the trid, but once they're
on the streets, the harsh reality, danger and power trip of the
job change them into callous, cynical, controlling people. And
there's no one to hold them accountable except other cops.
· People Watcher
. The role of police in our society has changed. In response to
an increasingly organized and armed criminal element,
they've been militarized to the point where police units are
indistinguishable from military units. Cops no longer have the
traditional support of the populace; they've gone from
beloved protectors to mistrusted agents of a faceless govern-
mental machine. In fact, I'd wager that many of the private
police outfits take that reputation and run with It. Your standard
Lone Star, Petrovski or Knight Errant cop prefers to be feared
rather than respected.
· Socio Pat
. Let's be blunt, the role of cops is to protect the rich from the
poor. That's why the pigs don't give a damn when one ganger
guns down another-but if you break a store window down-
town, the cops won't hesitate to shoot your punk ass. Property
is valued more than (meta)human life.
· Class Warrior
. You are all ignoring the specialized offices many police group
have to combat these precise problems. For example. NYPD
Inc. has a unit called CPR-Courtesy, Professionalism,
Respect-which indicates they're Interested in creating a rap-
port with the community that casts them in a very friendly, role
model oriented light. Every existing police corp has a unit like
this, dedicated towards re-establishing the historical role of
police in society.
e Doctor Spin
. All of those community policing strategies are just propagan-
da and data-mining tools. The cops convince the
"respectable" (read: affluent) part of the population that
they're making a difference by feeding them intel and ratting
out anyone they think is suspicious (read: ork or squatter).
. Class Warrior
. I don't think the suits running these police corps have any
illusions as to what role they play-I'm sure they're quite com-
fortable with it. Despite what they tell the communities
they're protecting, having a large criminal threat is good
business for them and helps the corps in general maintain
useful social controls. It's a balancing act between creating
and maintaining a sense of security among the citizens to
keep their reps polished and creating a sense of fear of (and
among) the criminals.

Since my business with the Star concluded, I've been keep-

post my way of saying thanks.
MODERN PRIVATE POLICE GROUPS
The law is big business. Private police contracting was well
underway decades before Lone Star signed its first law enforce-
ment contract. Faced with major headaches like union issues,
smaller budgets, crippling police brutality lawsuits and rampant
corruption, city governments turned to privatization as a solu-
tion. The bottom line for many municipalities was that hiring a
private police force was just plain cheaper than doing it them-
selves. By making it a bid process between corps, many cities
were able to cut costs without cutting quality.
· Yeah, It's cheaper because you're getting a shoddy, unreg-
ulated product. Government-run police administrations are
held to a strict standard of conduct. Private groups don't have
to be so rigid, so they can cut corners on their employees by
trimming wages, benefits and even training. When govern-
ments are looking to save money, they latch on to the least
expensive firm. Why do you think that firm is so inexpensive?
· Atlanta Spy
· There are a million reasons why it was better for governments
to let private companies do their dirty work. Better technology
and the breakup of superpower nations led to increasingly well
armed criminals and gangs. When the government couldn't
keep up with the growing sophistication of the criminal ele-
ment, there was no choice but to hand the job over to corpo-
rations that could. On a smaller scale, a lot of rich neighbor-
hoods and universities ensured their elite status by using private
cops to help protect their little corner of sprawl.
· Turner
. Let's just call this what it is; class warfare. When the cops got
privatized, the people who got shafted the most were those who
lived in poor neighborhoods. If you're a cop corp, there's no
overhead in putting money and resources into shanty-towns and
squats. And since these "citizens" weren't even citizens anymore
(thanks to strict SIN laws), In many cases they had no legal
recourse to force the government to provide protection. Face it,
Lone Star's policing philosophy in Z-zones is one of letting the
strong prey on the weak as long as the strong stay in their place.
· Class Warrior
. Civil liberties also went in the dumpster around the same time pri-
vate police became popular. Lone Star and their ilk quickly figured
out It raised profits to keep people in a near-constant state of
panic. Citizens who are fearful of their safety will let you do almost
anything to them as long as you promise them they'll be safe.

The organizations that offer policing services aren't mom
and pop outfits like you find with corporate security subcon-
tracting. The insurance rates alone are crippling-cop abuse
and wrongful arrests settlements are costly. As a result, most
cop contractors tend to have the resources of a megacorp
backing them, or they are megacorps unto themselves.
It's important here to understand the distinction between
a private security service and a law enforcement provider.
While many firms take on both types of jobs, there are key dif-
ferences regarding functions and legalities. A private security
service is contracted to protect private property, like a private
home, a corporate installation or a gated community. A law
enforcement service-please try to read this without gag-
ging-is contracted to help secure a safe and just society. They
uphold the law and are deputized to act with its full authority.
If a law enforcement provider fails to protect the streets or
maintain the support of the people they are protecting, it won't
belong before there's a new law in town.
THE POWER PLAYERS
So, who is the law? It depends on what part of the world
you're in. Only 30 percent of North American cities are still run
by old-fashioned government-controlled police forces ("gov-
pols"). Several cities are hybrids with private firms handling spe-
cific policing functions only, such as traffic control and detention
systems. Hybrid cities usually keep their govpols on hand for
sensitive tasks like crowd control or investigating and combating
major anti-social criminal acts (murder, kidnapping, terrorism).
Overall, private policing is dominated by two major com-
panies, with a handful of smaller companies taking up the
slack.
On the Beat: Lone Star
When Clayton Wilson bought up Bartholomew Security,
Inc. and Absolute Software, Inc. in 2017, it signaled the start of
a new trend, though few knew it at the time. Out of the merg-
er arose Lone Star, hyped up with the imagery of Wild West
marshals. They were gunslingers with badges, backed by for-
midable computer and information assets-the perfect card to
play in Texas. Three years after opening its doors, Lone Star
was taking on law enforcement contracts all across North
America and especially in the CAS. Today, they are the largest
private police force in the world, with offices inmost major
urban centers. Most carry the Lone Star name, but a few such
as the Genderarmerie in Quebec are subsidiary organizations.
When you hear about law enforcement, odds are people are
talking about the Star.
I worked as an undercover officer for Lone Star until they
buried my career for a chance to improve the bottom line.
Despite my involuntary unemployment, I still respect my cop
roots. Lone Star officers are proud and disciplined, represent-
ing the finest that law enforcement has to offer. A lot of what
I'm about to tell you is based on the Star's Operational
Procedures Manual. Star officers do everything by the book, so
if you're caught by a Lone Star officer, any case they bring is
gonna stick.
. Wolf is still too much of a loyalist for his own good. While it's
true that Lone Star has a higher conviction rate than the other
private forces, a part of that figure is due to what happens after
they have you in custody. Lone Star is infamous for their deep
interrogation methods that sometimes include illegal mind
probes. It's harder to get away with crimes if the cops know
where you buried the evidence,
· Kyra
· He also makes a huge generalization about Lone Star opera-
tions. While you can expect fair treatment from Star officers in
Charlotte, the Star in Toronto will be all too happy to soften you
up a bit over the hood of their car before telling you what they
think you've done wrong.
· Razor
Backup: Knight Errant
Damien Knight wants to rule the world. If he tells you oth-
erwise, he's full of crap. Not only does he command one of the
ten largest corps in the world but he polices a large chunk of
the northern hemisphere. Knight Errant (KE) is the clear num-
ber two in the privatized police corp arena. No one else even
comes close to having as many contracts or troops as KE and
Lone Star. KE is tied into Ares's military operations around the
world and many of their top execs, including Executive VP
Roger Soaring Owl, come from a military background. As a
result, KE is run more like a militia than a police force.
· KE focuses on corpsec contracts rather than municipal policing
services. They also specialize in more extreme policing actions,
stuff that crosses the border into merc territory. They have shock
troops on call to handle crises and civil disturbances, seek-and-
destroy anti-terrorist units and anti-insurgency and infiltration spe-
cialists. Not to mention their elite commando Firewatch teams.
They've saved more than a few governments from being top-
pled-and you can be sure they use it to their advantage.
· Errant Knight
KE saw an upsurge in business after their Firewatch units
helped quell bug outbreaks in many cities, and again when
they cleansed the bug spirits from Chicago using a strain of
astrally active bacteria. Chi-town hasn't been the same since,
but it earned KE a few new police contracts, including Chicago
itself. KE even went so far as to establish a division to specifi-
cally monitor and counter paranormal events, called the
Awakened Control Center.
A Firewatch squad tried to nuke Chicago In a misguided
attempt to abort the bug outbreak. Keep that in mind if KE is
guarding your urban center-they have no qualms employing
full-force scorched earth methods when necessary.

menting govpols rather than holding full policing contracts).
Hard Corps also has more detention facilities than KE (usually KE
subcontracts prison details out to Hard Corps) and isn't com-
mon outside of North America. Both Ares and KE use Hard
Corps as a dumping ground for problem personnel, so Hard
Corps goons are not exactly fun to deal with it. Hard Corps
used to harbor a lot of Aurelius sympathizers, but most of them
have skipped out now that Aurelius switched to Cross.
· Squire
On Call
Though nowhere near the size of Lone Star or KE, a few
other cop corps deserve mention. Most of these sideline in pri-
vate and corporate security gigs as well.
Centurion: One of the first major European private police
corps, Centurion has over the past few decades centered its
activity in areas of Africa where tribal disputes have made it
nearly impossible to have an unbiased native police force. It still
maintains contracts in several Spanish, Italian and Balkan cities.
Eagle Security: Eagle took a big PR hit when it failed to pre-
vent the bug outbreak in Chicago, not to mention losing some
top brass inside the Containment Zone. Despite this, it's still one
of the major providers in North America, holding contracts
throughout the CAS, UCAS, Sioux and Salish-Shidhe lands.
Petrovski Security: A subsidiary of Mitsuhama, Petrovski
has a global presence, though it often operates via local sub-
sidiaries with different names. Many runners don't realize, for
example, that the Ertxantxa police in Euskal Herria are shar-
ing the same databases and personnel as the Total Service
cops in Korea.
Sakura Security: This subsidiary of Yakashima has con-
tracts throughout the Japanese empire. Not surprisingly, it bla-
tantly engages in metatype profiling and has a disturbingly
high rate of instances where metahumans have been gunned
down during routine stops (often with excuses that the Sakura
cops thought that they were going for a gun when they were
actually going for a credstick to show ID),
Wolverine Security: Wolverine has a similar lousy track
record of excessive force and police abuse cases, except they
don't seem to discriminate based on metatype-they're equal
opportunity ass-kickers. Wolverine is especially notorious for
their gang-suppression policies, which typically involve solving
gang problems with lethal hails of bullets.
LEGAL ISSUES
A private law enforcement contract endows its holder
with the civil authority of the court within the realm of their
jurisdiction. They are the law until they step out of the area they
are paid to protect. Seems exceedingly uncomplicated doesn't
it? That's what I thought until I hit the streets. When you're out
there working, you have to deal with private licenses, extrater-
ritoriality and my personal favorite, the federal authorities.
It's getting to be so you need a license to walk your dog.
Why not? You need a license to do just about everything else.
All legal Matrix activity is licensed and monitored through the
tracking chips they put in over the counter decks. Anything
magical short of a fetish requires a license not only to use but
to carry. Firearms are no different. Nor is cyberware that is
licensed according to grade and function. These licensing
legalities differ from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, of course. But
what many of you may not realize is that private cops need
licenses too. Policing contracts include all sorts of restrictions
and legalities regarding what weapons and levels of force the
cops can use, what magic they can employ, what utilities and
IC they can use, how they can spy on criminals, subversives
and the population at large, what records they must or can't
keep, drekcetera, drekcetera.
I can hear you saying "so what?"-the cops are the law, so
they can break it whenever they want, right? That's certainly
true to a degree, especially when you're talking about minor
infractions or dealing with dangerous criminal scum like shad-
owrunners. But in an age of perpetual surveillance, the cops
know that a lot of what they do gets caught on camera, and
breaking the rules in some ways can lead to mass outcries and
riots or worse-investigation and punishment from higher
authorities, potentially leading to a contract severance.
. If you ask me, if I was taking a run against some KE goons, I'd
want to know whether they're legally allowed to only use small
arms or if they're permitted to have high-caliber machinegun-
racked drones and milspec gear. It could save my life.
· Jet
LETHAL FORCE
Unlike standard private security services that can only act
in self-defense, law enforcement contractors have the right to
use lethal force to ensure public safety. That means that officers
don't need to be in mortal danger themselves in order to cack
a perp. I'm not saying that a cop can cram a bullet into the back
of your skull while you're escaping with stolen goods. If you're
a perceived threat to public safety, however, they have every
right to take you out. If you're armed, using magic or showing
off dangerous implants, you can bet your hoop they will.
· Some jurisdictions allow private sec firms to obtain lethal force
licenses as well. So just because you're not running up against
cops or an extraterritorial corp doesn't means the guards might
not try to kill you.
· Highwire
· The lethal force laws don't work in a runner's favor. If a sec-
corp doesn't have the license, they can still try to wound you or
claim it was self-defense. If they do have a license, then they
can geek you as soon as look at you and get away with it with
minimal justification.

When I was still a patrolman I was called to back up a squad
car in pursuit of a stolen vehicle. The driver had hijacked a Brumby
and was tearing down Fleet Street like hell itself was chasing him.
The perp didn't have any regard for the other cars on the road or
the pedestrians on the sidewalk. Twice he sideswiped cars in
order to make them spin out in front of us. When he was close to

the I-5 on-ramp, the lead chase car radioed that they were going
to try and take him out. They felt that if this guy reached the high-
way there was no telling what kind of damage he would do. The
officers tried to ram his rear left tire and force the Brumby into a
spin. When that didn't work, they pulled alongside him and
pumped several rounds into the driver's seat. The perp died on
the scene, either from the crash or from lead poisoning; I never
bothered to find out which. What mattered was that the killing
was justified because the perp presented a threat to those around
him. That's the way the laws work now. So if you're racing away
from a run in your armed and armored getaway car, don't be sur-
prised when the cops do their best to kill you.
. There still has to be justification for the shooting if you want to
keep your job afterwards. The media sits around waiting for sto-
ries about over zealous security people shooting innocents over
mistaken intentions. Drek like that makes a sec firm look ultra-
bad. It's all just checks and balances in the end.
· Prof
. This all becomes a moot point when you're running against a
mega on its own property. Extraterritoriality makes it so they can
fragging well do whatever they like with you once you're over
the wall and on their property. This means geeking you, letting
paracritters snack on you or using you in medical experiments.
Megas don't have to play by the rules-they make them.
· Corp Watcher
CYBERWARE
You've probably heard that Lone Star doesn't have much
in the way of cyber except for a few exceptional cops. This is
true, but it's changing more every day. New recruits and long-
term personnel are both offered incentive deals to obtain
implants at like datajacks, comm units, biomonitors, reflex
boosters and smartlinks at steep discounts, deducted from
their paychecks on an easygoing payment plan. The program is
pushed as a way to climb the ladder quicker or get offered a
position in the department they desire. It's also protection
from what is waiting for them out on the streets-namely us.
· The downside for personnel that go under the knife is that if
they don't read the fine print too closely they may not notice
the Star is including a few "extras." The same goes for cops
injured in the line of duty-the Star has clauses that essentially
give them free rein with your body, since they're footing the bill.
I hear they've been experimenting with biomonitoring equip-
ment and simsense recorders, with all data going straight to
R&D so they can make a better cop.
· X-Star
. Police corps that run prison facilities get a fair bit of used 'ware
that they pluck from cybermonsters before throwing them in the
tank, or from prisoners who die in their care (since they usually
have a clause that gives them full possession of the remains).
· Skinner
MAGIC AND PARANIMALS
For the most part, magic is treated like just another
weapon in the cops vs. criminals arms race. Lethal combat
spells and the like are usually allowed just as guns are, but non-
lethal spells are preferred. The only spells that are strictly off
limits are control manipulation spells-though a good Mob
Mood spell could avert a riot, putting mind control powers in
anyone's hands is considered too much of a danger or tempta-
tion-especially considering that private companies may have
a conflict of interests. The metamagic technique of possession
is also typically off-limits to cops.
Spirits are also considered weapons, and police magicians
who don't handle theirs with care can expect to get into hot
water. There have been far too many cases of accidental fires
caused by elementals and other cases of structural damage,
evidence destruction or injuries caused to onlookers. Most
jurisdictions clearly restrict their magicians from calling on the
use of certain spirit powers, specifically any that cause fear or
mass panic.
Though common with some private sec services, law
enforcement does not have much need for paranormal crea-
tures, and so they are rarely licensed. Though many police
forces use horse-mounted officers for patrol or crowd control
duties and canine units for bomb-sniffing, the use of paranimals
is considered too risky for public service activities. At best, you
might find an animal control unit employing a specific critter to
help it locate and drive out other animal nuisances.
. Rather than mess with paranimal licenses and the associated
pains of caring for Awakened critters, many cop corps are pur-
suing canine cybernetics. Let me tell you, I'd rather go up
against four hellhounds than one cybered-up pooch.

@ | keep hearing rumors that Eagle Sec has been discreetly hir-
ing on shapeshifters for their magic and paranormal squads,
even in areas where shifters aren't technically legal. Seems like
they find their natural abilities to useful too pass by. My question
is, why would a shifter want to work as a cop?
· Two-Fists
SURVEILLANCE AND INTERROGATION
With few exceptions, the civil liberties of the past have
been soundly trimmed in favor of surveillance a watched
society is an orderly, society, or so the theory goes. Cops have
free reign to put cameras, microphones and other sensors in
public areas as they see fit. They can search for records on you
in any databases they can get their hands on. They can inter-
cept any form of wireless communication with impunity
(because broadcast transmissions are "in the public domain").
and they can monitor your Matrix activity without a warrant. As
a general rule, they only need warrants to read files/messages
or tap comcalls-and even then they can do it without a war-
rant in "emergency circumstances" and explain themselves
later. Your local laws may vary.
Law enforcement usually doesn't have the mage-power to
patrol astral space, but when it comes to astral surveillance legal

C
opinions get a little murky. In most cases, astral space is treated as
if it conforms to the conjoined physical space. So an astrally pro-
jecting cop can follow you around in public, but once you enter the
privacy of your home he needs a warrant or probable cause to fol-
low. Spirit surveillance with watchers is usually disallowed, cuz the
spirits aren't under direct control and can't understand legal
boundaries. Spirit testimony usually isn't allowed in court.
Detection spells are even trickier as local laws vary wild-
ly. Some places allow police to use spells like Analyze Truth,
Clairvoyance and Mind Probe without restriction, whereas in
others they require warrants or are not admissable as evi-
dence in court.
. In NAN countries like the Sioux Nation, magicians can use spir-
its and spells with almost no restrictions-hell, some tribal courts
even allow divination results as evidence.

JURISDICTION
"In compliance with the Business Recognition Accords,
any individuals located on properly designated extraterritorial
corporate property shall be granted the privilege of Immunity
from all applicable state and federal laws so long as their
actions do not extend past the boundaries of their corporate
territory. This privilege shall also be extended to certain autho-
rized diplomatic delegates of recognized corporations."
-Lone Star Operational Procedures Manual
Drek like that makes it easy to remember that Lone Star is
a corp at heart. On the streets, extraterritoriality only becomes
an issue if your collar runs onto megacorp turf in order to avoid
arrest or the perp flashes diplomatic credentials and bleats,
"You can't touch me."
A policing contract grants the force control over areas of the
city not specifically protected by the Business Recognition
Accords. Take this data to heart folks. It means that the cops
can't touch you once you step onto property owned by an AA
rated or higher corporation. It doesn't even have to be a signifi-
cant piece of property so long as its borders are clearly marked
and a sign of some sort on the property gives notice of the com-
pany ownership. I always hated it when the guy I was chasing
would shimmy a fence right into a corp's warehouse space. They
knew I couldn't follow them. All you can do is have your superi-
ors contact the corp in order to negotiate a temporary writ of
action order within that territory. Now that I'm a runner, I'll admit
that it's slick to take advantage of boundaries like that. Odds are,
the cops are waiting for you on the other side, but if you've pre-
arranged some sort of pick-up within the corporate territory then
it allows you a chance to get in the air without being shot at.
· Runners are big on this tactic. Corporate space is dangerous
in its own right, but a rarely used corp facility with low security
can be a safe-haven when Lone Star is bearing down on you
with a Hughes Stallion and a pair of Citymasters.

e Wait-so you're saying that if the cops are chasing me, I can
just dip into my local arcology and the police can't follow me?
· GnuB
. That's how it works, except the local police will always make
corporate authorities aware of what's going on near their ter-
ritory. So when you bust through the doors corp police will be
waiting to snatch you up as a courtesy to the city. They'll turn
you right back over-after ensuring that the data you stole is
in no way valuable to them. If it Is, they'll relieve you of your
score and then hand you over.
. The Chromed Accountant
. Unless, of course, you happen to work for the corp you ran into.
Then the corp will make up an excuse, like claim that you were
killed entering or something equally false in order to make sure
their assets remain protected.
· Ren
. Anything of that nature is certain to bring down the wrath of the
Corporate Court. Larger firms like Lone Star and KE have a voice
with the court and will petition for the extradition of wanted sus-
pects. Fortunately, it rarely gets to that point.
· Wobbly
. So, If big sec corps like the Star and KE have extraterritoriality,
does this mean that their police stations and prisons follow their
corporate laws, rather than the laws of the city they police?
· GnuB
. Unlikely, as that creates conflicts of interest and the potential for
civil liberties violations. Usually the contract requires law enforce-
ment facilities to follow local laws.
· X-Star
These same rules apply to physical jurisdictions. Knight
Errant polices Chicago, but their authority ends at the Chicago
border. There are all sorts of "jurisdiction extendors" that
police can use to get around these limitations, though. Some
police have statutory authority to act within a given distance
outside of their geographical area (so long as the officer stays
within the state, or whatever the next tier of authority is).
Some states also have a "close pursuit" clause so that officers
may maintain authority while chasing someone they have
probable cause to arrest outside of their jurisdiction.
. It pays to know the local laws, chummers. The last thing you
want to do is slide to a stop after clearing a border to thumb
your nose at the cops only to realize that they're crossing the
border to nab you.
· Prime Runner
. Corps sometimes make similar arrangements with local cops, so
that they can temporarily extend their corpsec officers' authority
outside of corp grounds in pursuit cases.
· Highwire
· If the laws are in your favor, these jurisdiction spats can be a
boon, especially when you get two cop agencies that don't
play well together. A New York chummer of mine was running
from a Winter Systems officer in Manhattan a few years back.
He stepped into Washington Heights, officially KE territory, but
the cop continued pursuit outside of his jurisdiction. KE officers
saw the Winter Systems cop shooting at my chummer and drew
on both of them. Officially, the Winter Systems cop's pursuit was
against the law, and my chummer used the standoff to get
away. He got lucky, in my opinion; it's rare that the cops will
shoot it out and let the perp walk, even if they're competitors.
· Donjon
Now, if a cop needs to go outside the municipality's
boundaries to pursue an investigation, he can request "creden-
tialed empowerment" status within that other jurisdiction as a
special agent of the city/corp in question. A credentialed offi-
cer enjoys the jurisdictional privileges of a police officer, but
not the full immunity of a diplomat. In most cases, though, the
local police will send someone along to make sure the creden-
tialed cops do what they're supposed to be doing and nothing
else. The credentials typically only last for a pre-assigned
amount of time and cannot be renewed. Such credentials usu-
ally require a great deal of string pulling, so they're reserved
for special occasions where the only legal recourse is to send
your own people in to get the job done.
. And if it's too much hassle to get the credentials, they'll just
hire some shadow talent to do the job on the sly.
· Argent
. These sorts of credentials are very rare between sec corps.
When you have two competing companies pursuing the same
investigation they almost never share information with one
another. It would be like Yakashima helping Cross sell product.
It isn't beneficial to the company doing the sharing because it
makes them look bad for not being able to solve the crime and
makes their rival look good for getting the job done.
· Corp Watcher
. It's worth pointing out that armed medical service providers
also have to pay or otherwise wrangle authority so that they
are free to act to ensure the safety of their clients within the
jurisdiction of the local police force. A medical operations
license like this can apply to the entire jurisdiction or just certain
sections. In Seattle, for example, Doc Wagon is authorized to
operate anywhere within Seattle sprawl limits except for
extraterritorial megacorp land and Council Island, neither of
which are under Seattle's jurisdiction. You pop your wristband
on Council Island, and it'll cost big nuyen. DocWagon will con-
sider it a high threat situation automatically because they have

· Wolverine is famous for denying full operational clearance to
armed medical providers in their areas. When CrashCart tried
to set up an office in Cleveland, Wolverine authorities denied
them weapon privileges. If they wanted to perform medical
extractions, they'd have to do them unarmed. No response yet
from CrashCart, but I'm certain that
they're trying to find a way to change the
corp's mind.
· Mawdryn
Jurisdiction issues also arise over the
types of crime. In the UCAS, FBI authority
supersedes local police authority when it
comes to federal crimes and criminal
activity that crosses state lines. Elsewhere
around the globe, there are similar rank-
ing agencies that reserve the right to
assume command of an investigation at
any time. Since the government is paying private police firms,
they have no choice but to step aside. Rivalries develop here
when local cops see cases taken out of their hands that they
think they can handle, or when they're forced to cooperate and
work with another agency-especially when those agents have
elitist attitudes. On the other hand, they can be a blessing; if
your perp heads to Chicago to escape a Seattle collar, the feds
will bring him back. It doesn't matter to them that competing
police companies handle law enforcement in those two cities.
· The rule applies to military and espionage agencies as well.
It's an important distinction in nations like Tsimshian, where the
MCT-funded military often steps into civil matters in order to
ensure that the voice of the people is not heard.
· Digital Samurai
POLICING FUNCTIONS
Your basic police force is divided by function. A different
department or division-depending on the size of the jurisdic-
tion-handles each policing task. Some are handled from a
central office, others are run on a precinct by precinct basis.
The best way to cover all of the functions is to use Lone
Star's unit structure as an example. Other cop agencies will orga-
nize differently, but they'll handle their duties in a similar way.
DIVISION OF PATROL
Patrol is the public face of the police, the ones who cruise
the streets and are first to respond to emergency calls. These
are the cops on the front lines, the ones who put their lives at
risk dealing with crime on a daily basis.
The Patrol Division constitutes the bulk of the manpower a
police force has. The best way to prevent crime is to keep a vis-
ible presence in the sprawl; the effectiveness of a force
depends on its day-to-day patrol activities and response times.
If you run into cops on the street, either by accident or because
they're responding to a call, these are the cops with whom
you'll be dealing.
. If the cops that tag you aren't from Patrol, then you're either
being watched or some department is actively looking for
you-bad news either way.

Patrol officers are expected to

of a situation right away, so they don't
tolerate people that don't follow
orders. They receive daily briefings
and real-time updates, and they can
cross-reference databanks from the
field, so they're expected to be aware
of everything happening within their
designated patrol sector.

· Minx
Patrolling officers aren't out there on their own, of course.
They're in constant communication with dispatch (who may
even have video feed) who can send backup their way in min-
utes. Patrols are supplemented by a saturation of surveillance
cams, spotter drones and other sensors (everything from
Gridlink sensors to audio pickups that listen for gunshots and
pinpoint the origin).

o It's not uncommon for law enforcement to float surveillance
blimps in place over high-security areas, so that they can call
down an aerial viewpoint of a situation in seconds. It's hard to
run from an eye in the sky like that.
· Rigger X
At the Star, the Division of Patrol is divided into six depart-
ments; traffic, shore, air, street, highway, and FRT.
Department of Air Patrol
The flyboys of Lone Star run the Department of Air
Patrol. Spotter drones, RPV's and fixed radar stations keep an
eye on licensed air traffic. Any commuter air vehicles oper-
ating without transponders or logged flight plans are inves-
tigated and warned to land. The bulk of personnel here are
riggers, either patrolling in one-man Northrup Wasps or run-
ning Wandjina attack RPVs to intercept unauthorized or dan-
gerous traffic.
. Knight Errant's air traffic policy is about peace through supe-
rior firepower. Thanks to Ares, KE air jocks are outfitted with top
of the line patrol copters and even attack helicopters and jet
fighters to keep the skies safe in extreme circumstances.
· Errant Knight
. Petrovski's been known to use fixed SAM batteries to shoot
down rogue air traffic. They're very careful about where they
use them-they don't want a stray missile taking out a sky-
scraper penthouse-but who cares if some SINless squatters are
showered with debris?
. Blue Thunder
Department of Highway Patrol
Highway cops use photovoltaic paint schemes to ride
undercover and catch speeders and other traffic offenders.
They also handle accident investigation and run random
stops to intercept smuggler traffic. Their real task, though, is
keeping the highways safe from predatory go-gangs, joyrid-
ers and underground racing clubs. They have a technological
upper hand with souped-up interceptor vehicles, drone cov-
erage and directional radar and video surveillance, but truth-
fully they lack the manpower to cover every stretch of high-
way, especially at night. As a result, some strips are by
default left to the gangs, though the Star will run random
checkpoints and area saturation sweeps to keep the street
thugs on their toes.
· Knight Errant has been using undercover cops as drag racers
to goad gang members into a challenge and then arresting
them after the race ends.
· Jammer
· Highway Patrol uses lots of other toys to bring chases to a
quick end. Aside from the regular spike and zapper strips, they'll
use vehicle override codes to remotely shutdown the engines if
possible. They also have a device that fits in the trunk of a patrol
car that can be used to fry the electronics of a vehicle directly
behind it, forcing it to stall.
· Rigger X
Department of Shore Patrol
Shore Patrol is usually the first department to take a hit
when it comes time to slash budgets. Shore's primary opera-
tions are on the open water, hauling in smugglers and taming
pirates. They receive a great deal of support from air patrols-
drones cover larger areas of water than boats can. Ground
patrol units are usually called in to assist any arrests.
0. Smugglers have gotten a lot smarter these days and are tak-
ing their business underwater. A couple of cop shops also use
Vulkan Delphins to patrol beneath the surface.
· X-Star
Department of Street Patrol
Street Patrol includes your neighborhood beat cops, bicy-
cle or horse-mounted officers, motorcycle cops and standard
squad car patrols. As a rule, patrols are done in pairs, except
for beat cops in high-security 'hoods. Shift changes are stag-
gered between precincts and even between units, so you can
no longer get an edge by planning your run during shift
change. Patrol cops tend to become intimately familiar with
their neighborhoods. They get to know the snitches, the delin-
quent juveniles, the gangers and the "concerned citizens" who
point them in the direction of any trouble.
. Unlike the Star, most other forces have patrol units that are
specially designated as tactical gang crimes units. These offi-
cers patrol undercover in areas with increased gang activity,
often working hand in hand with vice or organized crime units.
· Serpico
· Modern patrol officers are personally wired direct to dispatch
with encrypted radio, biomonitor feeds, GPS data and some-
times even video. That means that if you cack a cop in an
alley, central dispatch is going to see his vital signs flatline and
send units to that location right away. Patrol vehicles are also
decked out with radio, wireless Matrix links and numerous data-
recording sensors.
· Kyra
. Since these are the cops us runners are most likely to run into,
let's take a scan at what gear they'll be carrying.
Your standard squad car is a Lone Star-modified, armored
Ford Americar. It's onboard computer is linked to an encrypted
radio, wireless Matrix links and onboard cameras and sensors. A
windshield heads-up display and fold-out monitors allows the
cops to access data without jacking in (which they never do
on the street), Shock plates are mounted on the exterior and
embedded in the back seat. Front and rear-mounted flashpaks
are integrated with the light and siren array. You'll typically find
two Mossberg combat shotguns and strap-on armored torso

plates in the trunk, along with extra handcuffs, plastic restraints, mage masks, pulse cuffs, jackstoppers,
skilltwitchers, and DNA, blood and cyberware scanners.
The officers themselves will be packing Defiance Supershock tasers, stun batons, Ruger
Thunderbolt heavy pistols and either armored vests or light security armor, with helmets.
· SPD
Department of Traffic
These are your meter maids and slags left to stand in the
middle of the street directing traffic when something goes
wrong with the automated systems. Traffic cops use radar
and laser equipped drones to spot speeders as well as air
and street lamp mounted camera drones to watch for
repeat offenders. GridGuide and drones handling parking
and traffic management in many areas, but in lower
security zones these grunts do it manually. It's not
uncommon for them to drive around and scan every
vehicle they come across, so be careful about parking
your hotwired wheels on the street.
Fast Response Teams
Lone Star uses Fast Response Teams the way
other corps use SWAT. If an officer sees something
they know the average uniform can't handle, they'll
radio for the FRT. The FRT is literally doing nothing
but sitting around, suited up, waiting for such a call.
They immediately assess the situation and decide
what level of response is necessary.
A standard squad is twelve officers broken
down into two fire teams. Each team arrives on the
scene in its own armored Citymaster or WK-2 Stallion
rotorcraft. FRT teams are armed and armored to the
gills. Everyone wears heavy security armor with active
helmet display and carries the standard Thunderbolt
sidearm. Primary weapons differ from member to mem-
ber, mood to mood. They always have a sniper armed
with an MA 2100 rifle and a breach officer armed with a
CMDT combat shotgun. Additional members carry either
HK-227 SMG's or the favored AUG-CSL assault rifle. Each
team includes at least one magician, usually a mage-though
shamans and adepts are also mixed in on occasion.
In the interest of redundancy, the Star has both FRT and
SWAT teams. Officially, SWAT is supposed to handle hostage sit-
uations and similar high-risk situations where a degree of delicate-
ness is needed. FRT handles brute squad stuff, low security zone
dangers where collateral damage is not an issue. The two units are
in constant competition with each other, often racing to a scene to
be the first unit there and thus the unit in charge.

DIVISION OF MATRIX SECURITY (AKA "GRIDSEC")
GridSec cops patrol the local grid the way patrolmen walk
a beat. They monitor public Matrix space, investigate online
anomalies and crimes and respond to reports of Matrix intru-
sions or deckers aiding criminal activity. Contracted law
enforcement is restricted from accessing non-public govern-

ment grids, however (that pesky conflict of interest thing
again), so don't expect to find Lone Star deckers watching over
government datafiles. That task falls to the Department of
Justice Matrix Marshals, who have authority over government
grids and Matrix crimes-in the UCAS at least. GridSec only
gets invited in to government or corporate systems that lack
their own security deckers, or in emergencies.
· Matrix crime jurisdiction is entirely relevant to where your
"consciousness" is. If you're hacking an Ares host from a jack-
point on the Seattle grid, that crime is under Ares's jurisdiction,
not Lone Star Seattle.
· FastJack
. The cops don't publicize it, but the majority of Matrix crimes are
unsolved. The Matrix is simply too big and too complicated to
catch all those deckers, however, so the cops have a different
philosophy-make flashy examples of those they do catch.
Media coverage of apprehended Matrix criminals is usually sen-
sationalized, taking up almost 30 percent of crime coverage for
what amounts to about 2 percent of crimes reported. Matrix crim-
inals can also expect stiffer punishments to deter all those hack-
ers still at large (because that tactic is obviously working, ahem),
· Tuttle
Lone Star has a new psychotropic IC program called Snitch
that compels its victims to report on their criminal activities and
those of their associates to authority figures.
· Grid Reaper
The other major task of this division is protecting Lone
Star's own computer assets. All of those criminal records, per-
sonnel histories, police reports and investigative files are
secured away by a small army of GridSec deckers and more IC
than the North Pole.
· A lot of other divisions and department heads are nervous
about GridSec sniffing around in their files and business-espe-
cially if they have something to hide. Internal Affairs keeps a
close eye on GridSec to make sure they don't abuse their posi-
tion-rumors are that they even have their own secret com-
puter security department.
· X-Star
DIVISION OF PARANORMAL INVESTIGATIONS
With the exception of FRT and SWAT combat mages, this
is where most Awakened personnel in Lone Star end up. The
"Dips" are in charge of almost every policing function involv-
ing magic. Unlike other Star divisions, the DPI functions semi-
autonomously with separate offices and an entirely indepen-
dent budget. The Dips demand the newest technological and
magical accessories in order to handle their laundry list of
responsibilities, and they get it. It's no secret that Dips are both
feared and despised by the rest of the Star for their elitist atti-
tudes and overbearing natures.
Every precinct has a small unit of Dips who do nothing but
spend all day lying in bed attached to medical support so they
can respond immediately to calls for astral backup-usually
with a few elementals in tow. The Dips are also called in on any
investigation of crimes involving the use of magic. Lone Star
also maintains a Dips unit in each city charged with paranimal
and spirit control duties.
. The Dips don't bother "arresting" spirits that commit crimes.
They settle for banishing them outright.
· Shetani
The Dips are also in charge of regulating magician's licens-
es and registering foci and magical materials. So if you're
reported as being an unlicensed mage or suspected of dealing
in unregistered telesma, it's the Dips who will come knocking.
This is actually a big revenue source, so it's no surprise that
Lone Star lobbies hard for stricter magic laws. A large section
of the DPI is also devoted to magical research.
· The Dips run a subsidiary to the Star called Silver Dawn, an
independent security consulting firm that helps to pay the bills
at magic central and fund the private goals of the division's
top spell jock, Fraser Simington. Associate Coordinator
Simington has spent the last decade undertaking top secret
research deep in the belly of the DPI's main office in Austin,
CAS. Nobody really knows what he's up to, but rumor says it
involves astral journeys lasting longer than most would assume
is possible.
· Magister
DIVISION OF DRUG AND CHIP ENFORCEMENT
Curtailing the drug and chip trade is considered by many
to be a losing battle, but vast police resources are still dedi-
cated towards it. Often the policing of mindbenders is tied in
with a vice squad, but Lone Star prioritizes it enough to make
it a separate department. Drug and BTL control officers usual-
ly work closely with the Organized Crime Department, since
the gangs and syndicates are the ones handling manufacturing
and distribution.
. Or the corps are. Remember 2XS? That was a Yamatetsu-
engineered chip sold on the black market to unsuspecting
beetleheads who became involuntary test subjects. Word is
that the neo-now chip making the rounds is another corp idea.
It enhances the senses in the same way as bliss, except that it
makes you feel like you're living in the Matrix with your ASIST
jacked all the way up.
· Chip Runner
DIVISION OF SPECIAL TACTICS
The Division of Special Tactics, or TacDiv, runs a number of
smaller departments that you, as a shadowrunner may come
into contact with. These departments include Demolitions, Riot
Control, SWAT and Dispatch.

Demolitions
Better known as the Bomb Squad, Demolitions is respon-
sible for defusing or dismantling any explosives threats levied
against the public. These days the Bomb Squad is comprised of
riggers with a small squadron of bomb-sniffing and utility
drones to handle explosives removal or controlled detona-
tions. Some Bomb Squad units also use trained dogs and
chemsniffing drones to seek out hidden bomb threats. The
occasional odd magician will also be posted here to use spells
and spirits to contain explosions and fires.
Most police forces also have biohazard units to handle
chemical, nano and bio-warfare attacks. These officers are
trained in identifying threats, quarantining the situation, pre-
venting contamination and handling media spin to keep mass
panic from breaking out.
. These units used to worry about major terrorist attacks or virus
outbreaks, but lately they've faced off against smaller-scale
bioware threats. A few cults and terror groups have started
using bioware chemical glands to sneak nasty viral bugs past
scanners into populated areas like travel centers or sports sta-
diums so that a simple exhale can poison hundreds or thou-
sands of people.
. Holy Fire
· Demolitions also disposes of outdated police firearms and
materiel. There have always been rumors that a lot of demo
units sell the guns rather than destroy them but the paperwork
proves otherwise.
· Balthazar
. And if you believe that, then I own Mitsuhama. Those late
model guns end up on the streets sooner or later.

Riot Control
Riot control focuses on non-lethal responses to large-scale
demonstrations that have spiraled out of control. Nowadays,
police forces will trot out the riot squad every time there's a
gathering of more than fifty people. Different agencies handle
agitated crowds differently. Some prefer to keep a situation
defused and focus on containing and not provoking the crowd.
Others will try to intimidate a mob into dispersing with target-
ed arrests and displays of force. Others will go straight to
declaring the mob an illegal assembly and will use whatever
means it can to disable and conduct a mass arrest.
Riot squads have a lot of toys at their disposal: flash and
stun grenades, tasers, gel rounds, pepper spray and tear gas,
freeze foam, slip spray, splat glue, water cannons and sonic
rifles. Generally, they will soften a crowd up with tear gas or
sonics and then roll in with full security armor, taser clubs and
electrified macroplast shields. The shields carry enough voltage
on the front side to stun anyone who touches them. The taser
clubs double as projectile tasers that can accurately take out a
target at ten meters.
Riot control teams prefer the classic Citymaster for
heavy-duty assignments. When dealing with overwhelming
numbers they shut down the electroshields and flip on the
water cannons.
. This is a load of drek. Both the Star and KE have long records
of "accidental" deaths when quelling riots. Wolf neglects to
mention the chronic overuse of gel rounds or the fact that
those tear gas canisters are often aimed at specific targets and
are fired with enough velocity to kill. Riot control squads are a
breeding ground for anti-meta types who are just itching to
crack a few skulls.
· Antifa
SWAT
SWAT, or Special Weapons and Tactics, is called in for high
threat situations (that means you, chummers). A SWAT unit's
aim is to incapacitate the threat as quickly as possible with min-
imal civilian injury. Most units train together in order to func-
tion with one brain, thinking and moving as one.
SWAT team makeup varies depending on the force. Lone
Star SWAT squads have sixteen highly specialized members.
Eight are rifleman, four are snipers, two are spotters and there
is also a decker and a combat mage. Centurion SWAT teams
consist of a sniper, spotter, grenadier, medic, rigger, decker,
field commander and two breach officers. Standard SWAT gear
includes the equivalents of standard light to heavy security
armor, AK-98 or Ares Alpha assault rifles with underbarrel
grenade launchers, CMDT or Remington 990 combat shotguns
and MA 2100 rifles for the snipers.
· The grenadier is the explosives and chemical weapons spe-
cialist. Their job is to incapacitate the runners before the
breach officers and everyone else piles into the hot zone.
They'll be armed with thermal smoke, sleeping gas and various
other chemical agents (some which may officially not exist).
They also bring prep any charges for blowing open barricades.
· SPD
· SWAT teams set up interlocking fields of fire over a target the
moment they hit the ground. The basic team strategy is to use
the grenadiers or riflemen to lure the targets into a kill zone
where the snipers have their best chance of getting a clear
shot. In the case of Lone Star, four snipers break apart into
teams of two, each with a spotter calling out the targets. This is
particularly effective during hostage situations. A good sniper
squad can have eight hostiles down before anyone is the wiser.
· Argent
Dispatch
Dispatch represents the nerve center of any police opera-
tion. Modern dispatch centers are virtual nodes, with dispatch-
ers running on response-boosted SOTA cyberdecks for maxi-
mum interaction and networking. Each node features a zoom-
enabled detailed map of the city with icons that note the loca-
tions and status of active duty officers, surveillance cams,
Panicbuttons and more. GridGuide is linked directly into this
system for real-time traffic data, and other databases are with-

in easy reach. Several security deckers monitor the node for
intrusions, and the physical location of the dispatchers is also a
secured location.
. Lone Star signal experts would like you to believe that it's impos-
sible to break into police channels. If that's true, then why are the
trid snoops always on the scene before the cops get there?
Police officers do use heavily encrypted radio channels, but truth
is, there's always someone smart enough to break the code.
· Glitch
· Dispatch offices change the crypto key everyday, though.
Officers receive the new key when they start their shift. Sure,
you can crack it each day, but it's easier to get the day's code
from a cop contact.
· Skater
· Dispatch officers communicate using unit codes for cops on
the street and code numbers for different criminal incidents
and situations. If you're going to scan
their comms, learn their lingo.
· Sneaker
. A little known secret is that off-duty
officers are often tracked by their
Implants and required comm gear just
as on-duty ones are. This is rarely done,
except for emergency cases when dis-
patch needs an officer somewhere
right away and the only person who
can get there is an off-duty cop-or in
the rare instances when Internal Affairs
is investigating a cop corruption case.

· Dispatch always faces a major
headache with bogus panic button calls, fake bomb threats
and crank calls of every persuasion. It could be kids playing a
joke, a crazy person doing their thing or shadowrunners creat-
ing a distraction to lure cops away from a particular location.
The only way to know for sure is to send a squad or drone to the
location for a physical check.
· X-Star
Irregular Assets
From time to time, Lone Star and similar cop corps will call
on professional bounty hunters to track down a skip or handle
a wanted criminal that they neither have the time nor desire to
track on their own. These may be wanted criminals, suspects or
just witnesses the department lost track of. The Irregular Assets
department assigns a contract for each person, according to
their ranking on the list. Technically, bounty hunters are subject
to stringent screening, licensing and background checks before
they are hired.
· The process includes a thorough background check, finger-
print analysis, and retinal scan. Most bounty hunters are ex-
cops who have either retired or been kicked off the job for one
reason or another. Unfortunately for us, they still feel like they're
the law, but don't feel like they need to observe any laws when
trying to bring their bounty in.
· Kai
Naturally, Irregular Assets also sometimes turns to the
shadows for work they need done off the books. Each
department usually keeps a small group of fixers on the pay-
roll who are charged with arranging personnel to discretely
handle problems that Lone Star has no official jurisdiction
over. This is all extremely secret and deniable, of course,
Lone Star is supposed to be catching criminals, not hiring
them as problem solvers.
Don't consider a job like this to be free rein to run amok with-
out persecution. The Star will make it clear that you should
avoid collateral damage or
breaking laws unnecessarily. If
you go too far, they'll have no
qualms about taking you
down-and since they'll want
to keep you silent about your
arrangements, that means
they'll probably aim to take
away your breathing privileges.
· X-Star
DIVISION OF INVESTIGATION
This is where all the good
trideo material comes from.
Investigation includes the
departments of special investi-
gation, homicide, vice, robbery,
surveillance, organized crime
and forensics. In other security firms, precinct level investiga-
tion departments break down into much smaller groups; a cou-
ple of detectives deal with all the robberies, others get stuck
with homicide, others still get sex crimes and so on. Cases that
relate to multiple departments will have a team composed of
members from each relevant department to work on it.
. And just like on the trid, these intradepartmental teams are
dysfunctional messes. Petty rivalries, bad attitudes and career
ambitions get in the way of basic cooperation more often than
not. It's usually not so bad as to ruin the investigation, though.
In private cop corps, detectives know that if their interference
hurts the bottom line, they'll be out of a job.
· X-Star
· Knight Errant handles these department-overlapping cases
differently. They assign the case to one department only,
based on a hierarchy of crimes (homicide over robbery, for

example), available personnel, experience and, of course,
internal politics. They have less competition and interference
that way, but you will occasionally get a detective who refus-
es to stop after his case has been re-assigned to another team.
Most detectives have too much workload, though, to com-
plain about losing a case to someone else.
· Errant Knight
. You'll of course find that investigations involving crimes
against the wealthy or influential take precedence over the
murder of some gutter punk. And if the suspect of an investi-
gation is SINless, expect the cops to arrest him first and then fig-
ure out what evidence they can put together afterwards with
no regard for his basic rights. If they can beat, blackmail or
intimidate a confession out of him, all the better-after all, cop
corps have an economic incentive to "solve" cases.
· Blade
· Or they may just cack the perp. That way cuts down on the
paperwork.
· Star-Crossed
Forensics
Crime scene investigators (CSI) are more doctors than they
are cops. They specialize in evidence recovery, something
you'll want to learn about before you waltz into that corp and
start touching everything. The Captain tells me that Dirk will be
filling us in on forensics ops later on, so let's move on.
Homicide
The purpose of this department is obvious. It's actually one
of the most prestigious departments in the Star, as some cases
are high-profile and sensational and make good trid fodder.
Organized Crime Department (OCD)
I spent the better part of my career in OCD. This depart-
ment works against the local syndicates, gangs and any other
group deemed an organized criminal organization by the high-
er-ups. Yes, that means established runner crews as well. OCD
is broken down into separate task forces for each major syndi-
cate (Mafia, Yaks, Triads, etc) and one that handles the miscel-
laneous leftovers (runners, gangs, smugglers, etc).
OCD relies heavily on street-level contacts and informants
for their investigations. Major effort is put into ways to apply
pressure to key underworld figures to either intimidate or
blackmail them into ratting out their colleagues. Though the
information from snitches isn't as reliable (after all, many
snitches have a monetary incentive to hand over intel-
whether the intel is true or not), they are preferred over actual
undercover agents as undercover work is riskier and more
time-consuming. Neveretheless, OCD puts agents as deep
undercover as they can go. I was with the Cutters for over a
year, never once coming up for air. Other guys in my depart-
ment stayed under much longer than that. We're gangers, Yaks
and sometimes runners. All of it to make a bust on the people
we learned to call our friends.
. | met Wolf through his work with the OCD. I thought he was with
a local gang called the Cutters. When I needed gang backup,
I'd hire his crew to be my muscle. Never once did I suspect that
he was a cop. He shed blood with his gang, even killed for them.
I would have stayed in the dark too if he hadn't told me he was
a cop and his cop buddies were setting me up for the big fall.
· Kyra
. Hey Kyra, how can you be sure he's really turned his back on
his old mates? You heard what he said: OCD puts agents under
as deep as they can go. I'd watch your back if I were you.
· Cynic
· OCD is a runner's worst nightmare. Take note, police work is usu-
ally judged by the collars-the fewer collars made, the less effec-
tive the officer and department is perceived to be. OCD receives
massive funding and manpower, yet it scores relatively few col-
lars, simply because the syndicates are more organized (not to
mention other reasons that certain mob bosses seems to be
immune from prosecution). So in order to justify themselves, OCD
sinks a lot of effort into busting gangers and shadowrunners-
after all, we're not as well connected as a mob boss or syndicate
crew can be. We live in the shadows, SINless and without regard
for public safety. It's the perfect media tool to promote the effec-
tiveness of a division that on average isn't very effective.
· X-Star
Robbery
Unlike Homicide, the Robbery Department is considered
low prestige. The grunt work is tedious and the majority of
cases are never solved. Quite often a robbery investigation
leads to an organized crime or drug link, so the case is handed
over to the appropriate department.
Special Investigations
This is where all the cases that no one else wanted end up.
Special Investigation covers everything from missing persons
to cold case files. It's also the branch of the Star that handles
investigations for clients who want to hire the Star on a one-
shot basis.
Surveillance
These cops handle the technical details of tapping comm
lines, monitoring Matrix activity and even tailing suspects.
Surveillance is mostly a high tech operation. Most security
firms divide their surveillance departments into remote surveil-
lance and hands-on tracking teams. Physical tailing is a man-
power-intensive operations, so it's reserved for important
cases. Shadowing teams typically involve multiple officers on
foot and/or in car, aided with drones, who switch off tailing the
suspect every few minutes to avoid suspicion.
Vice and Morality
This department handles rape, prostitution, suicide,
domestic abuse, illegal gambling, hate crimes and so on. These
State of the Art: 2064

Page 77:
BEHIND THE BADGE
NOVATECH
officers are exposed to some of the worst aspects of metahu-
manity, so the turnover rate is high and they tend to be jaded
and depressed.
NON-ENFORCEMENT DIVISIONS
There are two sides to law enforcement; crime prevention
and everything else. Specialized areas such as psychology and
penology fall into the "everything else" category. Most of the
personnel working this side of the job aren't officers, they're
negotiators, lab techs and other support staff. A few of them
deserve special mention.
Internal Affairs
These are the guys who theoretically keep the Star on the
straight and narrow. They police the police, dutifully watching
for any sign of corruption or wrongdoing. They're responsible
for investigating wrongful death, excessive force, discrimina-
tion and police abuse claims.
Don't believe it for a sec. Lone Star is a corp, and what it's
most interested in is its bottom line. The Star couldn't give a
drek whether some yuppie snob feels his rights were violated,
So Internal Affairs ends up being more about keeping up
appearances than actually stopping any wrongdoing. Sure, if
they catch a cop on film beating an ork for no reason, they'll
take "disciplinary action"-which usually means transferring
that slag off to another city and putting him right back out on
the street.
Penology
The Department of Penology handles the transition to the
big house as well as providing "temporary care" for offenders
in jail awaiting their hearings. Penology also monitors cons on
probation or parole.
. There's money in prisoners the same way there's money in
students. The government pays corps an annual fee for every
convict that a corp watches, be it through parole or pre-
release monitoring. The money stops when the ex-con is no
longer in the system. There are only two ways out of the system:
staying clean for the duration of your parole or you can be exe-
cuted by the state. In most cases, an ex-con will break the law
again and get sent back inside. Star cops have a nasty habit of
trying to make ex-con's screw up-after all, cons are the pris-
ons' meal ticket.
· Muckraker
Parole is an early release system designed to reduce the
number of bodies in prisons. Once you've served a portion of
the time you were sentenced to, you meet with a parole board.
They decide whether or not it is safe to release you back into
the public on a parole basis. Once released, a con is mandated
to meet regularly (usually weekly) with a parole officer and
adhere to restrictions regarding curfew, residence, employ-
ment and even personal associations. These terms are decided
on a case-by-case basis. Parole can last longer than the original
sentence, given the fact that the time is done on the outside
and therefore counts for less.
Parole officers also handle probation, which is essentially
parole without prison time. Probation is usually awarded to first
time offenders and accompanied by several hundred hours of
community service. People on probation must meet regularly
with a parole officer and adhere to any terms put on them by the
sentencing body. Any violation of the probations terms will result
in that person being imprisoned for the rest of the sentence.
. Parole officers can be nasty fraggers. They understand that
being marked as a convicted felon seriously limits the type of
work you can get hired for. So they give you a job list crammed
full of people who will hire you, people who tend to have an
off-the-books arrangement with the parole officer about what
happens with your paycheck. A lot of these places that hire ex-
cons also deal in the illegal and are expecting to use parolees
as muscle.
· Jaz
. Parolees are often tagged with a GPS tracking bracelet so
that the police are notified if they leave city limits or violate any
boundary restrictions they're given. They are also notified if the
bracelet is removed or tampered with.

DEALING WITH THE LAW
by Kyra
Having a contact within the system is vital to how we do
business-and vice versa. Just because a cop is willing to feed
a runner data it doesn't mean he's corrupt. It's usually just an
exchange of information that helps the officer do his job better.
There are few people who are as tuned into the streets the way
your average runner is. Cops appreciate that and are willing to
give a little for the greater good you can provide them.
Of course, a lot of cops are corrupt too. When you spend
that much time fighting back the bad things in our world, it's
easy to slip over the border and become one. The larger the
police force, the greater the chance you'll see a corrupt cop or
group of cops. It's easier to get away with being dirty when
your actions are not so closely monitored. This line of work isn't
supposed to be about money, but let's face it, everyone wants
to be rich. If you can offer a cop a taste of that good life,
chances are the term "dealing with the law" won't scrunch
your face up the way it does for most people.
· Corruption happens on smaller scales too, except when a
small outfit is corrupt, everyone in it is corrupt. You have to play
along in order to work there, or you're going to have an "acci-
dent" a few days into your new job.
· SPD
BRIBES
Street cops pull in close to 40K a year, which is what a run-
ner can get for a single job. It's enough to live on but it isn't
luxury money. You want to get a cop to deal with you, offer
him something he'd consider substantial. According to the rule
of one runner I knew, offer 100¥ for the cop to look the other

(
way, 500¥ for him to disappear. Prices went up for harder to
perform tasks such as destroying evidence. An officer can dou-
ble his salary feeding scraps of information and aid to runners.
Others will do it for information or favors that can be called in
later. I get my data from a Star who has a secret fetish for ork
women. He'll keep giving me what I need so long as I can dis-
creetly arrange for his "special encounters."
Word to the wise, check out the cop you're interested in
approaching before you do so. It's not tough to spot a cop
that's willing to take a bribe. Check 'im out for a few weeks,
pay close attention to who he talks to and whether or not any
money is being exchanged in these encounters. Look for older
and jaded cops, cops who've taken bribes before. If it's a new-
bie you're after, it'll take more than a few creds to win him
over, especially if he still has any starry-eyed idealism or
romantic notions. But give him time.
One way to go about it is to set up a situation to make a
cop need money, and need it fast. That requires a lot of
research and effort, though, and you risk making him suspi-
cious of a setup. Another way is to get to know an officer away
from the job. Find a way to meet casually and then, over the
course of the developing friendship, bring up the opportunity
for them to make some cred on the side.
· Above all, be discreet and don't offer a bribe that can be
traced. The cop will be worried about Internal Affairs, after all.
And don't rely on a bribe to get you out a messy situation.
There's no way a cop's going to take a bribe to do something
that will raise a lot of questions in his direction.
· X-Star
If at all possible, only negotiate with the cop when you're
on equal or superior terms. If you get pulled over for a random
check and an APB comes over the radio with your description
because of a run you just pulled, trying to bribe the cop ain't
likely to work. The cop knows he has by the short and curlies,
so he's more likely to take your nuyen and arrest you anyway
than he is to let you walk.
COP CONTACTS
Naturally, some badge bunnies are more worth knowing
than others. Some can help you out by letting you know where
the other cops are, or by providing some evidence crucial to
your next run.
Standard patrol cops are a good first choice. These slags
are the first line of defense against crime. They're so close to
the dirt that they're usually in it. Patrol duty is also the first stop

in an officer's career, so it's a good opportunity to win some-
one over who could later grow up to be police chief. Police rig-
gers are also good to have on the payroll, as they can tell you
where the cops' eyes and ears are-valuable intel if you plan
on avoiding them. Detectives and GridSec cops have access to
all sorts of interesting databases and case records-including
info that regular beat cops won't have access to. Need some
data on a Mafia Don? Try an OCD detective.
. OCD detectives are good to know because they can warn
you about trouble before it reaches you. They make a living
keeping an eye on what's going on in the underworld, so they
can throw you a heads up if a Yakuza captain plans to get
rowdy at your favorite nightclub. They also know who's who, so
they can tell you whose palms need to be greased to ensure
that you don't have problems in the 'hood.
. Wolf Larson
. Earlier Wolf mentioned the problems cops have with extrater-
ritoriality. A corporate liaison officer is the person in the district
who makes or takes the phone call that can mean the differ-
ence whether you get chased across extraterritorial bound-
aries or not.
· Corp Watcher
OPERATIONS
. Operations might not be the most exciting part of police
work, but it's something that every shadowrunner should know
something about. If you end up on the wrong side of the law,
there are worse things to know than how the cops are sup-
posed to do their job stopping, searching, arresting and pro-
cessing you through the system. Even though everybody over
the age of ten knows that things don't always happen that
way, at least you'll know the theory. I've asked X-Star, formerly
of Lone Star, to give us the rundown.
· Captain Chaos
by X-Star
You know that expression about doing things "by the
book?" Well, you might be surprised (given the way things
often go down at crime scenes in the real world, anyway) to
find out that in the case of law enforcement there really is a
book. For Lone Star it's called the Operational Procedures
Manual, but you can bet every police department and most pri-
vate cop organizations have their own version. How well they
follow it is another matter, as I'm sure most of you know-
there's a big difference between what someone does when
they think they're being watched and when they know they're
not. Cap has asked me to give you the official take on things.
but to also provide how things happen in reality too.
I'm not going to parrot back chapter and verse of The
Book-that'll just waste your time and mine, since anybody
sufficiently enterprising can track down a copy on their own.
Instead, what I want to do in this file is give you a feel for how
all the dry rules and regs work-and don't work-in the real
world and how they might affect you as a shadowrunner.
Naturally, there are variations from country to country, city to
city and force to force, but the examples here should serve as
guidelines (that's your cue to do your own local research).
STOPS AND SEARCHES
You'll be happy to know that (at least in theory) the cops
aren't allowed to just pull you over and search you because
they don't like the color of your car. According to The Book, a
search warrant is usually required before police can search
your private property. This includes your vehicle-unless the
officer can see something inside, she'll need your permission
to check places she can't see, like the trunk or under the seats.
. This only goes for private cop organizations like Lone Star-the
govpols and feds can search anything they want as long as
they have "probable cause," and believe me, they're great at
coming up with reasons after the fact for why it was perfectly
logical for them to do the search.
. Stir-Crazy
. The feds can search (non-extraterritorial) corp property too,
though it's a lot harder for them to get permission to do it. The
private cops can't do it at all. Something about "conflict of
Interest" and "ulterior motives."
· Tusker
. Don't forget that failing to give permission for a search looks
suspicious all by itself-sometimes if you don't have anything
illegal in there it's best to just let them do it and get it over with.
Of course, If you are carrying something iffy, you'd better hope
you can turn on the charm. They won't search you right away,
but likely as not they'll find some reason to make sure that car's
not going anywhere until they can figure out how to get per-
mission to do it. You'd be amazed at what they can come up
with: expired registration, license plate problem, reckless dri-
ving-they've got a million of 'em.
. Noid
. If they really want to search, they'll search with or without per-
mission. Sure, they've got cameras in their cars so they have to
be careful, but "temporary technical difficulties" occur far
more often than they should. When It's the cop's word against
a lowlife shadowrunner like you, who do you think the judge is
gonna believe?
· Zed
. It's worth a mention here that digital cameras in cop cars
have the ability to "pre-record"-they're always on, storing
footage in a buffer so when the cop hits "record" it's actually
picking up a minute or longer before he hit the button. Useful
for collecting evidence-or for catching unwary perps.
· Harvey

· Before you let them search you because you're clean, don't
forget that this is a great chance for them to plant something
in your vehicle. Never trust the cops.
· Finnegan
. And finally, to cap off the litany of warnings. All of the above
only pertains to people who have the right to claim rights. If you
get pulled over and present your fake ID and they catch it,
you're busted. If you don't have a fake ID and you don't have
a legal SIN, you're busted. If you have a legal SIN but you also
have a criminal record, you're busted.
· Kyra
If the officer needs a warrant before performing a search,
he must fill out an affadavit describing what they're looking to
find and why they expect to find it on your property, get a
judge to sign off on it and then serve the warrant. There are
"no-knock" warrants, but usually they're supposed to knock
before entering unless they suspect that you can destroy the
evidence before you come to the door. For example, if they
suspect you of possession of drugs you could flush down the
drekker or BTLs you could burn, they might not knock, but if
the warrant's for a stolen car, odds are you can't destroy the car
before they can get inside, hence a knock is required.
. I don't know if it'll do you any good with Joe Cop breathing
down your neck, but the thing about warrants is that they're for a
specific purpose, and only evidence pertaining to that purpose is
admissible. Some warrants are open-ended, but those types are
a lot harder to get a judge to go for. More likely it'll say something
like "search the premises for evidence of stolen cyberware or
drug paraphernalia or firearms or whatever"-if they come in
looking for evidence hooking you to an office break-in and in the
course of the investigation they find stolen vehicle parts, they
aren't supposed to seize the vehicle parts during the search. It
doesn't always work that way, of course, but that's the rules.

· That gets a lot muddier if they find illegal items in your pos-
session-for example, they're searching for clues about your
office break-in and they find your kitchen table covered with
illegal drug paraphernalia. They're still not supposed to seize
the stuff, but in cases like that I wouldn't count on getting off
scot-free even if there's no sign of the evidence they were look-
ing for in the first place.
· Stoner
. Also keep in mind that a lot of the judges they get to issue
these warrants are close personal friends of high-placed corp
muckety-mucks. So when someone says a certain kind of war-
rant is hard to get, that just means an extra phone call from the
appropriate executive is in order. If they suspect you of some-
thing and they want to have a look at where you live, there
really isn't drek you can do about it.

PATROLS AND ARRESTS
Contrary to what a lot of people (including a lot of shad-
owrunners) believe, the cops don't just arrive at a crime scene
and cuff everybody who looks suspicious. Before making an
arrest, an officer has to either see the perpetrator committing
the crime or else be able to gather a preponderance of evi-
dence that the person either did it or was conspiring to do it.
That's not always as easy as it sounds.
What You Can't See Can Catch You
Don't think that just because Joe Cop isn't patrolling the
area in his unit he can't see what you're up to. Patrol cops are
mostly just there for visual deterrent: the real surveillance is
happening with spotter drones, traffic cams, astral sweeps and
all sorts of eye-in-the-sky tech that most people don't even
think about until after they've been nabbed by it.
In any areas with a halfway decent security rating, a small
army of quiet drones buzzes around patrolling the streets with
facial recognition software running. If the drone spots a known
criminal or a crime in progress, it relays the data to dispatch
who alerts the nearest officer. The drone net is supplemented
by the cops' access to integrated surveillance technologies
such as GridGuide and external corporate security cameras that
occasionally lend their images to the police datanets.
· Some of the nicer neighborhoods even have resident drones
that live in drone houses on top of streetlights. These keep an
eye on things and they can even be used to detain criminals if
a call comes in or a crime is detected.
· Margay
· Physical vehicle and foot patrols tend to overlap, crisscrossing
over the blind spots in the police's electronic surveillance net.
A good way to know where the electronic eyes aren't is to look
for where the cops are.

Making the Collar
Keep something in mind when dealing with an arrest situ-
ation: this might sound really obvious, but cops are people just
like you and me. They want to stay alive so they can go home
to their spouses and kids at the end of the shift. Any time a cop
arrives at a crime scene, it's an unknown and potentially dan-
gerous situation. They don't know what's going on, and believe
me, that's scary. Maybe they've got some advance information,
but that never prepares them for what they may find.
When dealing with these kinds of situations, their first pri-
ority is to secure the scene so nobody-and that includes
you-gets hurt. This doesn't mean that they won't get rough:
if that's what it takes to get things under control, they've got
the authority and the means to use reasonable force to take
control of a crime scene. The key word here is reasonable.
· Yeah, right-we all believe that. I haven't met a cop yet who
doesn't get off on knocking heads because he can. Especially
when dealing with SINless scum like us.
· Bung

. A lot of how they respond depends on how you respond.
Nobody expects you to just stand around meekly and wait to
get hauled off, but the cops are going to treat you a lot differ-
ently if you start shooting at them (especially with lethal force)
than if you do your best to get your hoop away from the scene.
· Snakebite
The second priority is to detain anyone who might be a
witness, victim or culprit. Cops have the option of detaining
you for up to 72 hours in the UCAS before actually charging
you with a crime. In most cases, cops will only detain you until
they feel they've adequately questioned you, unless they're
hoping to or are planning on charging you, but just need some
more time to collect evidence.
. What's really scary is how much the cops can make use of all
kinds of correlated databases to gather a pretty complete pic-
ture of whomever they pick up. Think about it: they can do
things like look at all the incidents that have occurred in a given
area over a given time. Then pull up the addresses of anybody
convicted of a particular type of crime in a particular area.
And then pop up your rap sheet along with a list of all your
known associates. There ain't no such thing as privacy any-
more. Best just not to get stopped at all.
Blood Brother
X-Star doesn't mention one of the nastier aspects of police
work-racial profiling. Sure, the cops pretend it doesn't hap-
pen, but trust me. it does. Officially the cops are supposed to
treat everyone equally-unofficially, trolls and orks are more
likely to get stopped, searched and hassled (especially if
they're in the "wrong neighborhood"). Things also tend to go
more harshly for metas than for norms, even if they're clean.
· Bung
Once the scene's secured and the suspects are rounded
up, the party shifts to the local precinct house where you'll be
processed and booked into the system. If you don't already
have a SIN, this is where you'll be assigned a shiny new one.
As if that wasn't bad enough, what you get isn't a John Q.
Public-type SIN, but a SIN of the criminal variety. In short this
means that you get all the hassles of having a SIN without too
many of the benefits.
. These criminal SINs are a bitch to get rid of once you've got
them, too. They hang on like leeches, even when (or if) you get
back out.
· Mister B
. Something to note in passing: when they've got you in the
squad car, keep your mouth shut. They're recording everything
that happens in there, even if they forget to mention it to you.
· Carl
Processing continues with a series of scans designed to
verify your identity: blood test, cyberware, DNA, fingerprint,
hair-sample and retinal scans. When they get done there isn't
much about you that they don't know, and unfortunately for
you, all this data is linked up with your new SIN.
Yeah, and remember, all this usually happens before you get
to see your lawyer and before you're formally charged with
anything. You can bet the cops aren't all that forthcoming
about getting rid of all this data if it turns out you didn't do it
after all.
· Mean Green
. Not just that, but all this stuff makes a great ritual link too. If
you do happen to break out, you'd better make sure some-
body takes care of this stuff or else they'll be on your tail as soon
as they can get the magic boys mobilized.
Hallow Man
Finally, any illegal cyberware you're sporting (and we all
know that for shadowrunners that's usually the rule, not the
exception) is dealt with. Note I say "dealt with"-not neces-
sarily "removed." There are plenty of horror stories going
around about suspects who've had their 'ware ripped out by
none-too-compassionate surgeons without much regard to
things like attention to detail, but surprisingly it doesn't often
happen that way anymore. Disabling cyberware is a lot cheap-
er and easier than removing it, and as long as the prisoner can't
make use of it, it doesn't really make a big difference which
one they choose.
. This is true. Ever since the Star lost a big lawsuit a couple of
years ago when they yanked the wires out of the son of some
big corp suit who was slumming it for a night, they're a lot more
careful about that kind of thing. This doesn't mean they show
tender loving care in disabling things, but at least there's a
chance that with a good cybersurgeon you might be able to
get it fixed once you get out.

· If you're a magician under arrest, you're in for a ride. They'll
slap a magemask on you right away and crank up the noise

risk of you slinging magic around.

worked alongside the nerd squad long enough develop a
strong belief in the idea that no matter how careful you are, no
matter how many precautions you take, you will always leave
something behind. Usually it's something physical: a finger-
print, a shoe print, a hair or fiber; the tiniest flake of skin or drop
of blood is like an open book to these boys and girls. Even if
you somehow manage to get in and out without a trace, that
in itself provides its own information, Some forensics special-
ists concern themselves with the physical, while others focus
on the psychological: motivation, habits, small quirks and tells
that you might not even know you're displaying. Even without
magic (forensic thaumaturgy is handled by a different depart-
ment), a lot of what these folks do appears nothing short of
supernatural to anybody who doesn't know how it works.
Most law-enforcement organizations have at least a
majority of the following sections: Questioned Documents.
(Meta)Human Identification (this includes fingerprints and
DNA), Ballistics and Firearms Investigations, Toolmarks and
Fibers, Forensic Chemistry and Biochemistry, Forensic
Toxicology, and Forensic Photography. Some of the smaller
outfits include magical and technological forensics as well, but
in the bigger organizations like the Star, these are part of sep-
arate departments.
All of these departments are important and highly valued
parts of the investigation. To me one of the organization's
strongest assets is the front-line crime scene investigation
team. I don't think it's being dramatic to say that a criminal
investigation can live and die by what these people do (or fail
to do). They're the first on the scene after the crime has been
reported and they take the first systematic and comprehensive
look at the evidence in its natural setting, rather than having to
deal with second-hand info in the form of photographs, sam-
ples and written reports.
When a team arrives at a crime scene, their first priority is
to seal it off so the evidence can't be contaminated any more
than it already is. This means physically cordoning off the
scene as much as practical and limiting access until after
they've completed their investigation. Afterward, the next
thing a good investigator does is simply look over the scene,
gaining impressions and noting them down in written or
recorded form. If the team has a magician, she might do an
astral scan for impressions and emotions, or a Catalog spell to
note potential evidence. The team often uses sniffer drones or
handheld chemsniffers to detect traces of chemicals that
might get missed by a live investigator, and recordings from
any nearby surveillance cameras are also identified and
logged. The more experience a team has, the more likely it is
that these first impressions will result in insights that reveal
useful information.
At this point, the real work begins. You might have seen
some trid shows about forensic investigators, but I've worked
with these guys and let me tell you this can be one of the most
boring, tedious jobs in existence. It doesn't all wrap up in an
hour with a catchy soundtrack. Forensic work-searching for
trace evidence, examining blood spatter and bullet trajectories,
making a trid of the scene, taking photographs and measure-
ments from every angle to document the scene and searching
for the elusive clue that unlocks the case can take hours or
even days to complete.
· When he says photographs, he means it-old fashioned film-
type ones. Digital photos are usually not permissible because
they're way too easy to tamper with.
· Snaps
. He makes it sound like every time Grandma's pet Fluffy gets
catnapped, the whole Sherlock squad shows up to examine
every inch of the house for clues. No such luck, friends. Show
me a law-enforcement department that's not either
strapped for cash, up to its ears in crimes to Investigate or
both, and I'll show you a really good fantasy novel. In reality,
they try to investigate everything but a lot of crimes get only
a cursory once-over (if that). Yeah, if they put all their efforts
toward finding you they'll probably succeed, but for them to
do that is a lot more rare than you think, particularly if there
are no deaths or VIPs involved. Don't get lazy, but you can
relax a little bit.
· Froggy
Once the team has gathered all the evidence they think
is necessary, they release the crime scene and head to the
labs. Other forensics staffers swing into action analyzing the
blood, skin, hair, fiber, trace evidence, photos and whatever
else the CSI team has gathered up, attempting to put togeth-
er a coherent picture of the crime that fits the evidence.
Again, you don't see this in the trids because it's too boring.
but the majority of crimes are solved by the simple matter of
matching things like fingerprints. DNA samples, ballistics
information and other trace evidence to the perpetrator. For
example, any gun that was ever legally sold has a ballistic
"fingerprint" on file somewhere, which means it can be
traced by checking it against the databases. Same with actu-
al fingerprints: sure, maybe you never committed a crime
before, but that doesn't mean you're not on file. Did your
parents get you printed when you were a kid on one of those
"keep your child safe" campaigns? Then you're on file. Don't
assume that every organization you might have given a sam-
ple to shares information (sometimes even different police
organizations don't), but just keep in mind that it could come
back and bite you.
Of course, none of this is infallible and plenty of mistakes
get made, but over all a lot of crimes are solved by the simple
application of scientific principles to the evidence. Not as excit-
ing as car chases and firefights, but that's reality, friends.
. There are ways to fool some of this forensic wizardry-just a
couple that come to mind are splashing bleach around the
scene to make any blood evidence it touches useless (Sterilize
spells work even better). Wearing fresh clothes for each run
minimizes things like hair and skin traces. Flats work great for this;
just take 'em off and dump 'em (or burn 'em if you're really
paranoid) at the end of the run.

THE BIG LEAGUES: COPS AND SHADOWRUNNERS
by Wolf Larson
As you might imagine, police don't generally respond the
same way to shadowrunner activity as they do to a report of
the local Stuffer Shack being knocked over. Newsflash: shad-
owrunners scare the drek out of most cops-at least the ones
who have any sense. Think about it: runners are generally bet-
ter armed, loaded up with more cyberware and mojo and bet-
ter trained than your average two-bit street criminal-and if
they've managed to last on the street for any period of time,
they're probably smarter as well. What all this means is that the
cops are going to bring out the big guns when they have to go
up against shadowrunners.
What are the "big guns," you ask? Unless the situation
goes to drek in a hurry and they have to use whatever assets
they have in the area, the cops usually send out heavily armed
and armored teams. For the Star, this means a Fast Response
Team or SWAT (sometimes both but not often-the two teams
have a lot of bad blood between them and don't play that well
together). Cops don't take chances with shadowrunners: it's
not at all uncommon to see armored ground vehicles, heavy
weaponry, magically active personnel and even armored rotor-
craft responding to this kind of activity.
. What he doesn't mention is that this only happens when the
activity in question is on public property, or corps too small to
be extraterritorial. For the big corps, the cops can't do a thing
even if they see it going down. This can really chap their hoops
sometimes when they get word that somebody they're after is
in the area but they can't touch him.
· Tanner
Just a word of advice: don't geek the cops if you can help it.
They've got a lot of friends and very long memories-and
believe it or not that goes both ways. If your team gets a rep for
going out of its way not to kill cops, they might just cut you a
break next time you're in deep drek.
· Ocelot
STING OPERATIONS
Blazing guns and car chases aren't the only way the cops
nab shadowrunners: many times sting operations are cleaner,
safer and more successful than resorting to brute force. This is
something to keep in mind at all times, especially if you know
the boys and girls in blue are after your hoop-they might just
try to snare you into doing something you'll regret for a long
time. One of their common techniques is to arrange for a
Johnson (unwitting or otherwise) to assemble a team for a job,
ensuring that one or two of the team members who show up
are working for the cops. Some of these deep-cover guys
spend years establishing their identities in the shadows, using
all kinds of disguises, plastic surgery and sometimes even
magical techniques to keep their real faces out of the lime-
light. What's good news for you is that when the cops bring
out assets like this they're usually looking for a particular indi-
vidual or group, not just fishing for whatever runners they can
take down.
e I know a guy who got nailed in one of these stings a couple
years back-he was an adept and a sadistic fragger who liked to
kill cops just to show he could. Unfortunately for him, he also had
a soft spot for Renaissance artwork. The Star arranged to have a
particular piece from a "private collector" in town to be deliv-
ered to a local museum, then employed a Johnson (without the
guy's knowledge-they were playing both ends against the mid-
dle) to set up a team to steal it. Our adept bit, not realizing that
three of the team members were Star plants. If he's still alive, he's
probably making Bubba the Love Troll very happy these days.
· Mackie
One thing to keep in mind is that, officially at least, the cops
can't entrap you. That is, they can't hire you to do something
illegal and then grab you when you do it. Of course, in cases
Ilke Mackie describes, it's going to be almost impossible to
prove that the Star arranged for the Johnson. If the defen-
dant's rich enough, there might be money to be made work-
ing for the defense lawyer to track down these connections,

BUSTED: DETENTION, TRIAL, PRISON
by Wolf Larson
So-you've been a bad boy or girl and you've gotten your-
self busted by the long arm of the law. What's in store for you
after you're hauled down to the station house, gotten your fresh
new criminal SIN, and have been booked into the system?
First thing is, you're going to spend some time cooling
your heels in the company of people you'd probably rather not
associate with. That means the police facility lockup, where you
share quarters with whatever low-life individuals happen to be
enjoying the cops' hospitality at the moment.
. Don't remind me. Last time I was inside, my roommates were
a cross-dressing ork named "Mimi" (don't ask) who hadn't
taken a bath in at least a year and an elven joyboy who kept
trying to proposition me.
· Conker
Somewhere in here, you'll have your first court hearing,
which is where you'll hear the charges against you and the
judge will determine whether you'll be allowed bail and if so
how much. If bail is denied or you can't scrape up the funds
(with or without the help of a bail bondsman) then you're sent
back to cool your heels some more until your trial. This can take
awhile to set up, so you'd better hope that you have some way
of posting bail. You will also need to find yourself a good lawyer,

if you don't have one already. I can't underestimate the impor-
tance of this point. Do whatever it takes to get one-mortgage
your mother, hock your dog, call in old favors-because the
modern-day legal system is nothing to try to negotiate without
skilled professional help (or at least a really good law knowsoft).
If you show weakness (in the form of no lawyer or a bad one),
it will chew you up and spit you out, and you'll be spending the
rest of your life in a federal prison. Get a lawyer.
. He ain't kidding. Fortunately for when I got arrested for
attempted murder, one of my closest chummers was the col-
lege roommate of one of those hotshot lawyers you see on the
trid news sometimes, and he agreed to take my case. He
played those guys like a cheap piano and got me off on some
two-bit technicality about how the evidence was gathered or
something. I was broke for quite a while afterward, but he was
worth every nuyen I paid him. Free and poor is better than rich
and in prison.
· Willard
The next step is arraignment, where you enter a plea.
Naturally, most defendants enter "Not Guilty," which results in
a trial. Depending on what you're accused of, your trial might
be before a jury or just a judge. Either way, this is where your
lawyer becomes very important. (Oh, by the way: if you did get
bail, here's another friendly reminder: either show up at your
trial or make damned good and sure that if you skip it's to
some place where they can't track you down. Bounty hunters
are very good at what they do and most of them don't care
much about what condition you're in when they hand you
over.) Trials can be very short or very long, depending on a lot
of factors-either one can work in your favor if your lawyer
knows her stuff.
· Trials are funny things, especially jury trials. Logic isn't always
the most important thing, even though it should be. Your lawyer
can use this in your favor if she can play to the jury's sympa-
thies. There's a lot of money to be had in things like digging dirt
on jurors, finding out what makes them happy or makes them
cry and, if they're not sequestered, what motivates them to
vote a certain way (if you get my drift).
· Mason
. This is assuming that the jury is even in the same room with
you-this doesn't often happen these days. Trials are usually
conducted by simcast, so the jury (and the judge) could be
thousands of kilometers away and a lot harder to influence with
subtle manipulation.
· Legal Beagle
. Keep in mind that this whole file has been very UCAS- and
CAS-centric. Trials in places like the NANs (assuming you get
one in the first place) can be a lot different, so check the local
laws before you commit any crimes.
· Wonko
At the close of the trial, obviously, comes the verdict. If
you're lucky enough to get a "not guilty" verdict-good for
you-you're allowed to go free.
. Yeah, right. Sure, they let you loose, but now you've got your
criminal SIN and if they have a pretty good idea you did it
they're going to keep an eye on you anyway. "Free" is a rela-
tive term when you've been charged with a crime.
· Bung
If, however, you are found guilty, then I hate to say it, but
things just went from bad to worse. This is when you get sen-
tenced, and that can be bad news. You'll get an appeal, of
course, but these things can drag on for a long time and in the
meantime you're still deprived of your freedom. Your best hopes
are either that your lawyer is good enough to get you probation
(which is most likely if it's a first offense and if you haven't done
anything particularly heinous) or that you can buy off the judge
(if you've still got the cred left to do it). The overcrowded prison
system makes both of these options more viable than you might
think, but make no mistake-you're fighting for your life now.
Take my word for it, you do not want to end up there.
IN THE JOINT
. The possibility of getting caught and going to prison is some-
thing that everybody who makes a living performing illegal
activities (that means you, my shadowrunning chummers) has
to keep in mind. It's not a pleasant topic, and of course every-
one thinks, "It can't happen to me." but let's assume for the
moment that it can. I've asked Hardcase to give us the low-
down on life on the inside, so maybe if you do get caught, you
might have a slim chance of surviving long enough to get back
out again.

What do a phoenix, a cockatrice and a shadowrunner who's
been to prison and lived to see daylight have in common? I'll tell
you: they're all rare birds that you're not likely to encounter in
your lifetime. It's an understatement to say that the prison sys-
tem isn't kind to us members of the shadow community, and the
joint has achieved kind of a bogeyman status among most run-
ners: get sent to prison, game over, thank you for playing.
It ain't necessarily so. Cap has asked me to talk a little
about prisons, prison life and what to expect when you end up
in the Graybar Hotel sporting cyberware or mojo. I'm also
going to provide you a glimmer of hope that there's light at the
end of the tunnel (the non-train variety, that is) if you do hap-
pen to find yourself cooling your heels in the joint.
MODERN PRISONS: DUELING PHILOSOPHIES
These days (at least in the UCAS and CAS, which is what I'm
talking about here), the majority of prisons are no longer owned
and operated by the federal government. Law-enforcement cor-
porations like Lone Star and Knight Errant have a sizable part of
the market but many of the extraterritorial megacorps are making
significant inroads. It didn't used to be that way-the prevailing

philosophy was that the feds should run all prisons, because with
a private operator there's no kind of oversight or regulator agen-
cies. The problem with this is that there were enough stories of
various abuses at the federal level. With the corps there's no such
thing. Used to be that all the prisons were run by the feds to avoid
these kinds of potential problems, but not any more.
All that changed in the early Twenty-First Century as the
lockups become increasingly overcrowded with no end in sight
to the growing number of people convicted of crimes. To deal
with the situation, the feds were forced to change their approach
to the incarceration of criminals. They did this in two ways: by
increasing research into rehabilitation methods (object: to get
the inmate out of prison and back into life as a good little con-
formist citizen), and contracting out prison-minding duties to
law-enforcement corps like Lone Star. Naturally, each of these
approaches has its supporters: the hard-liners want the perps to
suffer for their crimes, while the bleeding hearts think even the
worst criminals can be integrated back into society.
Neither of these approaches is a bowl of cherries for shad-
owrunners, especially the ones with cyberware or magical tal-
ents. Let's face it: the prison system is set up to deal with your
average perp-the folks who knock over Stuffer Shacks, mug
little old ladies or run citywide crime operations. Add in the
capability for large-scale mayhem and it tends to make the
people who run the lockups more than a little nervous. In situ-
ations like this, "nervous" means they're going to do every-
thing they legally can (and in some cases "legally" doesn't
enter into it) to neutralize the threat. If you're the threat, this
could seriously affect the quality of your stay in the big house.
Oh-before we go on, let me clarify one thing: don't get
"prison" confused with "jail." Jail is where you go while you're
working your way through the justice system, exhausting your
appeals and doing everything you and your lawyer can to
make sure you don't get convicted. Prison is where you go
after you get convicted. Night and day, chummers. When you
get arrested, your best chance at getting out in one piece is to
get the best lawyer you can-since once you get convicted
you get credit for time served. You'd be surprised at how
many people manage to serve out their whole sentence in jail
before the conviction finally gets handed down. That's the way
to do it if you can. It's the times you can't that we're talking
about here.
. It's also worth mentioning a little more about the difference
between a corp prison and a federal prison-the most impor-
tant difference being that the federal prison at least theoreti-
cally has to follow the rules, while a corp prison makes its own
rules. You'd better pray that if you get sent up the river you end
up in a fed prison.
· Horatio
. This is mostly true, but the Star and the other law-enforcement
corps still have to deal with quite a few regulations as well.
They're not great, but oversight committees and inspections
keep them mostly in line. It's the other corp prisons that are the
real nightmares.

"Don't do the crime
If you can't do the time
-Old flatscreen vid cop show theme song
So your appeals are history and you've gotten your ticket
to the big house. The name of the game for you now is survival.
Whatever prison horror stories you've heard about from friends
of friends, the reality's worse. I can guarantee it won't be pleas-
ant (not unless you've got some heavy-duty organized crime
connections, and I'm going to assume that's not true in your
case), but you can minimize the negative aspects as much as
possible by doing two things: cultivating powerful friends and
keeping your head down. Let me tell you a little about what to
expect as you arrive at your new home.
First thing: do you have cyberware? Whether you get to
keep it or not depends on a lot of things: how potentially dan-
gerous it is, what kind of resources your particular prison has
access to, the political climate in the area and the attitudes of the
people running the place. The stories about what happens to
cyber in prison are usually exaggerated: it's simply too expensive
for them to go in and rip out your 'ware, when it's easier, cheap-
er, and less invasive to simply disable it. If you're lucky, they do
this by cutting a few wires and deactivating the connections that
make it work. If you're not so lucky, they do nasty things like
inserting tiny bombs in your implants that are programmed to go
off when you activate them. Data and chipjacks are usually just fit-
ted up with a jackstopper, though it's not unknown for them to
remove it to facilitate simsense-based rehabilitation, punishment
or reward techniques. Sometimes they do remove your 'ware
entirely, but this is rarer than you might think.
· Magicians have it worse. Strong and tough the prison system
understands. Guys who can throw spells and send themselves
off wherever they want to are a little harder for it to deal with,
which means you can usually sum up their approach to magi-
cal prisoners in one word: overkill. Mage masks, 24-hour sim-
sense feeds, hallucinogenic drugs-let's just say that most
magician types have an even harder time of it in the joint than
your garden variety pumped-up sammy type. If they're lucky,
they get tossed in one of the more progressive prisons where
they use things like underground holding facilities, astral bacte-
ria and special manacles that prevent astral jaunts. Still no fun,
but at least you might make it out with your sanity intact.
· Collide
· The other problem faced by magicians in prison is that most
prisons have a hideous background count. All of the pain and
suffering pile up pretty quickly. This can have a serious psycho-
logical effect on the Awakened. It is not unusual for some pris-
ons to deliberately place the mages in their population in the
areas where horrible acts have occurred in the past. Also of
note are rumors that some magically active prison guards
become "attuned" to the background count, becoming more
sadistic and brutal in the process.
· Magister
. If no one else is going to do so then I'll say something about
Blackstone Prison. This is the notorious "mage prison" you might
have heard about. Blackstone was built about 30 years ago on
top of a mana warp found in eastern South Dakota. No one has
determined yet what caused the mana warp, but MCT was
quick to buy the land and build Blackstone on it as a site to
house the "dangerously Awakened." Most of the inmates are
mages or adepts but there are also some really nasty mundane
fraggers. Blackstone's mana warp seems to induce a range of
emotional effects from depression to catatonia, making for a
docile population.

Next: do you have a SIN? Regardless of whether you had
one before or if you got a criminal SIN when you were first
arrested, it will continue to haunt you through the prison sys-
tem. Don't get the idea that a criminal SIN gives you the same
rights and privileges as a regular John Q. Public one, either-
it's there just to keep track of you.
Your accommodations will be less than five-star.
Increased overcrowding in most prisons these days necessi-
tates putting more prisoners per cell, which means that
you're likely to have as many as three roommates. The good
news is that they usually separate the metatypes for safety-
if you're human you might end up with an elf or dwarf cell-
mate but no orks or trolls.
. Most prisons maintain separate cell blocks for orks, trolls and
everybody else. Trolls represent a challenge since they're so big
and strong-mixing them in with the general population usual-
ly results in a seriously decreased quality of life for anybody they
decide they don't like. Meals and exercise periods are usually
run in shifts to prevent problems.
· Goblin-Boy
· Speaking of meals, prison food is a good enough reason to
stay out of the joint. They get their food service from the lowest
bidder, and you never know what might turn up on your plate
from day to day. Oh, it's nourishing enough, but little things like
flavor and freshness aren't high priorities. It's even worse when
you're getting disciplined: they take everything and lump it all
together into this vile thing they call "the loaf." It'll keep you
alive, but you'll wish you were dead.
. Gourmand
. Not to mention the fact that prisons are used to field test new
food products. Sometimes this means the prisoners get a
treat-but not very often.
· Bogey
So-how do you stay alive in this hellhole? Like I said
before, the keys are friends and keeping your head down. If
you're already part of a group that has members inside (a
gang, Yakuza, Mafia, etc.) you're in better shape. Organized
crime types have it best because they usually have the best

connections to the outside world, and that can make all the dif-
ference not just for how you're treated, but for how much use-
ful stuff you can get brought in or smuggled in.
. This is true. Contraband keeps the prison economy running, and
the more wiz stuff you can get your hands on to trade-both with
guards and other inmates-the better your life will be. Cigarettes.
music and trid chips (especially chips like Cal Hots-chipjacks are
one of the few things they usually let prisoners keep, since it keeps
'em quiet) and drugs are the most popular, and if you can keep
a good supply coming in you'll be very popular.
· Stir-Crazy
If you don't have connections, your best bet is to start mak-
ing them right away. Trust me, this isn't the time to be picky
about your acquaintances. Unless you're the toughest troll on the
block, you won't make it as a loner. You might find it repugnant
to hook up with gangers, ork supremacists or Humanis goons,
but remember that the name of the game is survival. You know
that old expression about politics making strange bedfellows?
That goes double for prison life. Let's put it this way: make it true
figuratively so it doesn't end up being true literally, if you know
what I mean. Some of those guys in the joint get pretty lonely,
they still have urges that need satisfaction and you do not want
to catch their eye as easy prey.
. Another thing you can do, though you have to be a little care-
ful about it, is cultivate friendships with guards. The best way to do
this is to get them things: money is best, but they don't get paid
much so anything they'd find interesting will pay dividends. Just
keep it subtle and don't let the other prisoners find out about it.
And don't assume it'll last forever, since a guard's loyalty usually
lasts until somebody else starts bringing him better stuff.
· Max
. One thing nobody mentioned here is that if you handle it right,
you can actually make the prison experience work for you. They
don't call it "school" for nothing-you can pick up all kinds of use-
ful skills, techniques and intel on the inside if you hook up with the
right people.

FRIENDS IN LOW PLACES: PRISON GANGS
AND ORGANIZED CRIME
I mentioned it up above, but I want to touch a little more on
gang and organized crime involvement in your prison lifestyle.
Pretty much wherever you go they're going to be well repre-
sented. Sure, the composition will change-you'll find more
Mafia in the East and more Yak and Triads in the West, for exam-
ple-but regardless of where you end up doing your time you're
going to run into them.
Most of the big gangs have a presence in the prison sys-
tem-the Ancients, Cutters and Halloweeners, for example-
both the gangs and the various organized crime syndicates treat
prison like a kind of extended convention where you can get
together with your fellow crims and learn some new skills. While
they tend to keep to themselves and don't take kindly to out-
siders, if you play your cards right you can use them to your
advantage. They're the ones with their fingers in all the good
pies smuggling goods and intel in and out via mules and keep-
ing on top of all the good rumors and news from the outside.
Plus, most of them have some subset of the guards in their pock-
ets. This means that if you can manage to get on their good side,
you might be able to make your stay a little more pleasant.
. Be careful with this, though-even the smaller local gangs have
power if they've got enough members inside, but none of these
groups are going to give you anything without expecting some-
thing in return. Often you'll end up a lot tighter with them than you
want to be, even after you get out.
· Torque
. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially for runners who
haven't made their rep yet. You can do worse than hook up with
a group that can help you out even on the outside.
· Candlepower
. Don't write off the smaller gangs as potential help, either-a lot
of times the crime syndicates make use of smaller groups inside to
aid their smuggling operations so they can keep their own hands
clean. Just make sure you find out who a gang's affiliated with
before you make any overtures.
· Aloysius
. Don't expect instant results, though. A lot of these gangs are
going to demand a "loyalty test" from you if you're looking to
hook up with them. This usually means you have to do something
too risky for them to have a regular member do. If you do it and
survive, you're on your way in. Otherwise you're pretty well
fragged.
· Tusker
PRISON TECH
I've been going on a lot about the guards in this file, but flesh
and blood security measures aren't all you'll have to deal with. In
fact, live guards are by no means the primary way to keep pris-
oners in line, especially in the big federal lockups. Think about it:
guards can be bribed, taken hostage, corrupted or otherwise
turned against the system, not to mention the ever-present
chance that some punk with a good lawyer will manage to make
a brutality charge stick. No, modern prisons rely far more on high-
tech measures to maintain security and order.
You'd be surprised at how much of a prison is automated
these days: security riggers and automatic systems use drones for
patrolling, and you'll find cameras and other surveillance systems
just about everywhere you can see and a few places you can't. A
word to the wise: never assume that you're not being overheard
or observed when you're inside. That doesn't mean you always
are, but it's safer to be sure. This is doubly important when you
realize that prison officials supplement technological surveillance
with astral mages and spirits who can be wherever they need to
be. Privacy and prison are two words that don't go together.

NOVATECH
If one or more prisoners do get up to no good and start a
fight, riot or other disturbance, the officials are more than capable
of handling it without risking live guards. Many common areas
have taser-capable floors or gas-delivery systems that can knock
out a whole roomful of rioters without causing permanent injury.
For smaller disturbances, drones wielding stun weapons move in
to handle the situation.
. This isn't just true in the common areas-in most prisons the tech
extends into the cells themselves. For example, most of the newer
ones have self-cleaning mechanisms like the ones they use in cof-
fin hotels. Just move the prisoner out and hose the place down
once a week or so. Dehumanizing, but effective.
· Kearney
. Sometimes tech can be a good thing, though-I've heard of
a couple of federal prisons where they actually maintain an iso-
lated Matrix system for the prisoners. They can't contact each
other, of course, but if they keep their noses clean they can
jack in and enjoy a little entertainment. I guess they figure the
prisoners are easier to control when they're distracted. I hear
they've even been experimenting with allowing some prisoners
access to pornography and virtual-sex sims, on the theory that
if they get their needs met in cyberspace they might leave their
cellmate alone.
· Toreador
WORKING FOR THE MAN: PRISON INDUSTRY
So here you are, cooling your heels in the pen for the fore-
seeable future. You don't think they're just going to let you sit
around on your hoop watching the trid and playing in the exer-
cise yard, do you? It costs a lot of cred to feed and house prison-
ers, and most prisons pass as much of that cost as possible along
to the inmate population in the form of putting them to work in
various prison industries. Nowadays we've come a long way from
license plates and the prison laundry-inmate labor produces
everything from textile goods to industrial supplies to electronic
components and a lot more besides. Most of a prisoner's wages
go toward his upkeep, but usually he is allowed to keep a small
percentage on account for buying discretionary items like ciga-
rettes, magazines and other goods.
. This is true only if the prisoner's exhibited good behavior, of
course. Any funny business and they yank all that stuff away faster
than you can say "punitive measures." For that matter, your will-
ingness to be good and play the game determines what kind of
job you get, too-if you're smart and the guards like you, you can
get some pretty plum assignments. If not, I hope you enjoy clean-
ing the drekkers and the grease traps.
· Prole
· If you're assigned work in a trusted area you can sometimes
turn it to your advantage. I know a decker who got put on the
line to make chips and boards for some of the non-critical por-
tions of cyberdecks-he ended up coordinating his escape by
etching various information into certain lots slated for a corp
where a friend of his worked.
· T. C. Pip
REHABILITATION METHODS
Believe it or not, the system would prefer to rehabilitate
criminals and get them back into society rather than warehousing
them in prisons. It costs them a lot less, cuts down the burden of
overcrowding (which can lead to a lot of problems they'd rather
not handle) and makes the bleeding-heart politicians and citizens
happy because at least they're doing something positive. The
problem for you is that most of the rehab methods they use these
days make a few years in prison look like a preferable alternative.
Rehabilitation hasn't changed much in the past few years-
mostly it involves using simsense, behavioral conditioning and
other brain-warping techniques to convince you that you really
don't want to do whatever it is that got you tossed in the joint in
the first place. I don't have any personal experience with these
methods (if I did, I probably wouldn't be posting this file), but
from what I've heard, most recipients of these "progressive"
rehabilitation experiments don't come out the same people they
were when they go in.
· Lone Star has been experimenting for years with various sim-
sense-related conditioning techniques designed to eliminate vio-
lent impulses in criminal types, so when they get out they'll be
good little citizens who won't bother anybody. Unfortunately they
haven't gotten much better at it. The brain is a delicate instru-
ment that we still don't understand completely, and mucking
around with it more often than not produces unexpected results.
A lot of these test subject end up averse to violence, all right, but
with the side effect that they wig out when confronted with any
kind of violence-Including things like Urban Brawl games on the
trid or getting mugged on the street.
· Sigmund
· Another technique that's starting to see wider use after being in
the experimental stage for years is a scary little thing called
"brainlocking." They're still keeping quiet about how they do it,
but it works like a broader version of standard Pavlovian aversion
conditioning. For example, they can make it so anytime you think
about visiting New York City, using a weapon or driving a car,
you're overcome with feelings of nausea, pain, overwhelming
guilt or whatever the guys in the white coats want to instill.
· Skinner
. I've heard that the newest thing they're experimenting on in a
couple of the prisons is magical rehab techniques in conjunction
with the standard psychological and chemical stuff. They say that
using mind-based magic can help them pinpoint the approach-
es that will be the most effective on each individual prisoner, so
they can tailor the rehab program to fit. They claim it's more
"humane," but I can't see how having a mage poking around
your brain is any better than a psychologist.

OFFERS YOU CAN'T REFUSE
So I've made this all sound pretty bleak, but here's the good
part: you can get out, and I don't mean at the end of your sen-
tence or feet first sporting a toe tag. I also don't mean escaping-
it's been done, but with today's modern prisons it takes a lot
more coordination and planning than I can go into here. No, what
I mean is that sometimes the Powers That Be (or more likely their
corporate buddies) need something done, and if you've got the
talents they need, they might just make you an offer-do the job
and they'll forget about the rest of your sentence.
This can be very good or very bad for you. The corps have
been using prisoners with a history of being a runner as a source
of cheap labor for a long time-all you have to offer the poor
slot is his freedom, which doesn't cost them a thing. Since
they've always got their eye on the bottom line, this is a cost-
effective solution. The problem for you is that most of the time
these jobs are not exactly the most desirable. Often they're
downright dangerous. Usually they have a high probability of
your ending up dead (hey, it's cheaper than the death penalty
and they know that too). If you agree to do the job and you
manage to pull it off, though, you're sitting pretty. That's how
yours truly is speaking to you today.
. The corps keep a pretty close eye on the prison population, just
watching for the kinds of expertise to do certain jobs that they
can't hire free runners to do. Don't think it's out of the kindness of
their hearts, either-usually they fit the prisoners up with every-
thing from GPS trackers to cortex bombs to make sure they don't
just fly the coop as soon as they're over the wall.
· Palo
. Don't think they'll automatically just let you go, either. If you're
smart, you'll do the job they want you to do but stay well out of
their reach when you communicate the results. You might have
to get the GPS or the bomb disconnected, but if you show up in
person they're likely as not to just say "thanks, sucker!" and stuff
you back in the hole again. Nobody cares-it's not like you're a
"real citizen" with rights or anything. The good news is that they
almost never go after you if you skip after you've done the job,
since it doesn't serve the bottom line.
· Cougar
There's another way, but it's a lot more dangerous and
unpredictable. Corps need a lot of things, and not all of them
are shadowruns. Sometimes they just need a few guinea pigs to
test their newest product on, and since prisoners (especially for-
merly SINless ones) are basically expendable, they don't have
any qualms about offering them the chance to play lab rat in
exchange for their freedom. The problem with this is that
there's usually a reason why the corps in question are using
expendable people for test subjects: because there's a better
than average chance that you won't be around to collect your
shiny prize. Remember that they get as much useful information
from you after you're dead as they do when you're alive.
Sometimes they don't give you a choice, but if they do, don't
do it. Prison is better than dead.
. Listen to the man. I spent a few months in the joint before my
outside connections got me sprung, and two different cellmates
took the corps up on their offer to be a test subject in exchange
for getting out. They thought I was a fool for turning it down, but I
never saw them again after that. Another inmate told me he'd
seen their bodies wheeled out a few days later.
· Chumley
· Dead isn't the only thing you have to worry about, especially if
you're a magician. A mage chummer of mine ended up in the
joint and got "volunteered" for some experiment. They let him out
afterward-but he was never the same again. Mostly he just sits
around and smiles now, and I haven't seen him do any mojo
since he got out.

GAME INFORMATION
This chapter provides plenty of background for using cops
like Lone Star in your Shadowrun campaigns. If you and your
players are interested in running a police-oriented campaign,
check out the options starting on p. 116 of the Shadowrun
Companion. This possibility would allow the players to experi-
ence some of the unique challenges that face law enforcement in
the world of Shadowrun.
PLAYING WITH THE POLICE
The main interaction shadowrunners have with police is when
they screw up a run and bring the law down on themselves. It's
important for the gamemaster to handle these situations carefully,
as law enforcement has a lot of resources at its disposal. Close
encounters with the police can make for dramatic moments, but
try not to force your players into a battle with the cops. An
exchange of gunfire with the police rapidly escalates into a chase
sequence/running gun battle. The police will bring many assets to
bear in situations like this, including area surveillance coverage,
Fast Response Teams, astral backup, roadblocks and more.
Runners that don't play it smart may quickly be overwhelmed and
either killed or captured. This may not be the direction you want
your game to go, especially if you're in the midst of a plot. While
you want to present the police as a challenge, you also need to
make sure to give your runners a way out of the situation.
It is important to remember that most shadowrunners do not
possess a legal SIN. This becomes very important when dealing
with the police since a person who has no SIN technically has no
legal rights. This means that the police are well within their rights
to do whatever they like to a runner before they give them their
criminal SIN. The flip side of this is that the police are very wary
around shadowrunners, since they know that the typical shad-
owrunner has skills, equipment and abilities far superior to the
average police officer. The combination of these two facts will
often lead to the police using excessive force against shadowrun-
ners whom they capture or incapacitate.
Cop Contacts
Cops don't always have to enemies of the runners. As
detailed on p. 85, they can make valuable sources of information.
State of the Art: 2064
96

Page 90:
BEHIND THE BADGE
NOVATECH
It's important to remember that a cop's actual job description has
an impact on the data and assets accessible to him. A run-of-the-
mill Street Patrol cop doesn't have access to the investigative files
on the local Triad, for example, but he is likely to know what local
street gangs have been feuding lately and where you're likely to
run into trouble. Keep in mind that cop contacts are not likely to
give out information that will endanger other police officers.
RESOLVING ARRESTS
So what happens if a player character is arrested? It's up to
the gamemaster to decide how detailed you want to make the
proceedings. You can roleplay out the entire situation, from lock-
up to arraignment and bail hearings, playing out the character's
interactions with guards, other prisoners, the judge, etc. This
allows you to give the character a glimpse of life on the inside and
perhaps meet some new contacts. You can also give her a chance
to escape, or smuggle info out to friends who are looking to break
her out. If the character makes bail, does she return to court or
does she go on the run? If the character goes to trial, you can
arrange it so the character and other runners can influence the trial
by finding a good lawyer, locating, intimidating or bribing wit-
nesses, destroying evidence, pressuring the judge or jury and so
on. A character with Law skill can even try to defend herself.
though such a task isn't easy.
Alternately, if the character pleads guilty or the case is pret-
ty open and shut, you can just proceed directly to punishment
and either probation or incarceration.
RUNNING IN THE JOINT
Most players (and many gamemasters) believe that once a
character is convicted of a crime and sentenced to prison, they
might as well file the character sheet away and make up some-
one new. This is because most players believe that nobody will
ever see that character again. Prison in Shadowrun is consistently
portrayed as a brutal place populated by corrupt guards and dan-
gerous inmates and administered by a system that's inherently
biased against shadowrunners. On top of this, cybered characters
face having their cyberware removed, and magically active char-
acters have to fear experimentation, insanity or loss of magical
abilities. All in all, not a pleasant place to run a campaign.
Still, allowing prison's reputation as a black hole to scare you
away from letting your players experience it for a short term
means missing out on some potentially interesting gaming
opportunities. As a gamemaster, you'll have to be creative in find-
ing believable ways to bend the rules a bit to keep the characters
from suffering permanent losses of cyberware or sanity (unless
that's the sort of game you and your players enjoy, of course).
Once you've done that, prison can provide an intense and
rewarding experience that the characters aren't likely to forget.
The key to running satisfying prison games is to keep
everything temporary: instead of removing cyberware, the
cash-strapped prison simply deactivates it. Sure, the character
in question might have some trouble getting it re-activated
again when he gets out (this could be the subject for a game, or
even a series of games, in itself), but at least he won't have to
have it replaced. Same for magicians: come up with experi-
mental techniques that would allow the character to remain
with the general prison population instead of isolated with a
mage mask and a simsense loop. For example, perhaps this par-
ticular prison is testing out special manacles to prevent astral
traveling or a (removable) mental implant that causes intense
pain when magical activity is detected.
Another option is to begin a campaign in prison: the charac-
ters start out inside with their cyberware and magical abilities
neutralized (or, in the case of cyberware, perhaps it was
removed). At some point shortly after the campaign begins, the
characters are contacted by a former employer, a corporate rep-
resentative looking for a team to do a dangerous job or similar
entity. This contact then arranges for them to be released in
exchange for doing the job.
Remember, it's entirely reasonable that most large corpora-
tions keep some track of who's in the prison population and what
kind of special skills they might have. Because shadowrunner
prisoners are good sources of high-quality work at low-to-nonex-
istent prices, they probably get more attention than most. Add
that to the fact that the incarcerated runners are highly motivated
to earn their freedom and it becomes worth the corp's while to
assign a decker a side job of monitoring who's in and who's out.
You can use this as a convenient way to let runner teams have a
taste of prison life without doing hard time.
One more way to run an enjoyable series of games set in
prison is to have the characters plan an escape. Naturally this is
going to be a difficult thing to do, but you could get several game
sessions out of interacting with contacts, bribing guards, making
plans, and finally pulling off the job. If the players come up with
a good enough plan, give them a chance of succeeding-after all,
this could develop into an entire campaign as the team tries to
stay one step ahead of the long arm of the law (who might even
have useful goodies like ritual samples on the team). Paranoia is
your friend-if you're the gamemaster, that is.
Adventure Seeds
Here are a few adventure seeds that you can use for prison-
based games or campaigns:
A runner team is hired by a Johnson they trust to infiltrate a prison
to get hold of something- a bit of information from a prisoner or
guard, a file from a system not connected to the Matrix, or even
a physical object currently located inside the prison. The Johnson
arranges for their cover identities and provides them with con-
tacts inside the walls.
A group of player characters begins a campaign inside a prison,
where they have a chance to get acquainted with each other dur-
ing a couple of preliminary adventures inside the prison walls. At
some point, each of them is selected by a shadowy corporate
contact to perform a dangerous job in exchange for their free-
dom. After they complete the job, the corporate contact keeps
her word and arranges for the characters to be released, and she
can serve as an initial source of jobs until the characters build
enough reputation to go out on their own.
The player characters are all members of the same organized
crime syndicate (Mafia, Yakuza, Triad, etc.) or gang inside a
large federal prison. Because of their connections, they are
afforded more privileges than the standard prisoner, allowing
them greater freedom. Adventures for such a group could
State of the Art: 2064

BEHIND THE BADGE
NOVATECH
include following directions from higher-ups outside, smug-
gling contraband, conflicts with rival syndicate or gang mem-
bers, blackmail, or even planning an escape with the help of
bribed guards and outside contacts.
The guards in a prison are running various illegal operations
(smuggling, pit fighting, drug dealing, etc.). The player characters
can get involved in several ways. Three possible ideas include
aiding the guards in running these operations to gain extra privi-
leges, competing in the pit fights, or getting offers from prison
officials to spy on the operations and relay information in
exchange for everything from privileges to a reduced sentence.
NEW GEAR
The gear described below is not standard issue for your run-
of-the-mill beat cop, but will be brought out and used under
appropriate circumstances. Most of it is covered with police
markings or easily recognized as belonging to the police so run-
ners who get their hands on it should be careful in its use.
Electro Riot Shield
The Electro is a large riot shield with contact plates on the
face of the shield that deliver an electric shock to anyone they
touch (see Shock Weapons, p. 124, SR3). The current is controlled
by a switch on the insulated handgrip of the shield and can be
turned on and off at the officer's discretion.
Jupiter Taser Club
The Jupiter is a stun baton with a built-in one-shot taser, so
that riot cops can also zap targets from a distance at need.
NEW IC
Snitch Psychotropic Black IC
Similar to Juclas IC (p. 108, Matrix), Snitch is a subliminal
compulsion to secretly report wrongdoing to authority figures. A
character affected by Snitch will alert the appropriate authorities
to any upcoming or recently committed legal activities that he's
aware of. He will call anonymous crime prevention hotlines,
report incidents to 911 or find the nearest person with authority
to report the crime too (corpsec guard, manager or even mob
lieutenant). The Snitch-conditioned character will specifically seek
out authorities who have jurisdiction over the criminal act, or
those affected by it (so if he sees a runner gun down a gang
member in a Z-Zone, he'll report the incident to the gang boss).
The afflicted character is unaware that he is ratting out his friends,
acquaintances and even himself. Just like Judas, he will deny this
activity if confronted.
Whenever a Snitch-affected character has an opportunity to
report criminal activity, make a secret Willpower (Snitch IC Rating)
Test. If the test succeeds, the character resists the compulsion, but
still remains completely unaware of his inner conflict.
For programming size and game purposes, treat Snitch the
same as Judas.
NEW VEHICLES
Lone Star Sherlock Crime Scene Analysis Drone
The Sherlock is a microskimmer drone that is brought into
particularly delicate crime scenes in order to take and record
data readings. Its small size (less than half a meter across) and
ability to float above the ground ensure that it does not disturb
any evidence.

The Spectator is a next generation "spyball" surveillance
drone that has recently seen use by FRT and SWAT teams. This
drone is no larger than a racquetball and makes use of state of the
art gyroscopic propulsion systems to roll its way across flat sur-
faces, under doors and into secured areas without notice. Once in
place, it stabilizes it's position and begins recording data until
asked to make a burst transmission to the controlling rigger. Once
in place it is able to record sound and images and transmit them
to a nearby rigger or receiver equipped vehicle. Lone Star also
makes extensive use of the Spectator in prisons it controls.

Our upload on Europe triggered a flood of requests for more details on a number of top-
ics. Hundreds of queries hit Shadowland and the Helix from users intrigued by the short
primer to the Awakened and magical aspects of Europe. Since I am all about bringing you
the goods on the surprises you might encounter in our line of work, I tapped Helix's Magicknet
sysop Mime to pull the curtain back on the magical traditions you might come across in the
Old World.

Like everything on our fair continent, Europeans approach magic with schizophrenic flair.
Considering the Old World's cultural diversity, it's no wonder the local magic community is
an eclectic morass. Hanging out for any amount of time on the local Magicknet Undernet will
give you a taste of just how weird things can get.
Followers of the hermetic path-Prague academics, German Faustians or French seers-
appear to dominate the magic scene. Once you step out of the spotlight, however, a num-
ber of neo-pagan traditions come to the forefront, as well as local idiosyncrasies and the wiz-
styles of ethnic minorities. Nature and shamanic traditions come in many different shapes and
styles, though are much less visible due to a mistrust of the visceral magic of witches, druids
and their kind. This forces many to find employment on the fringes of mainstream society and
in the shadows.
. The bias extends to the corporate and academic communities. When the cards are down,
however, the suits go with anything that works, while the world of academia has been slow to
come around. In that respect, Europeans are more bound by tradition than North Americans.
. Marcel Black
With modern society being what it is, there's a multitude of minor traditions and
schools with small footholds as well, from wujen to voodoun. On our trip through European
Awakened culture, though, I'll focus on the best known factions-it's too easy to get lost in
the details otherwise.

I've asked some of the regulars on the Euro Magicknet to
give me a hand in profiling the major traditions, beliefs and
magic groups found in Western and Central Europe. It's a big
place and there's a lot to see, so sit back and buckle up, we've
got a lot of ground to cover.
NEO-PAGAN UNDERCURRENTS
Before we cover the splintered hermetic scene, let's inves-
tigate a tradition you're probably less familiar with-neo-
paganism. The differences in the traditions of neo-pagan nature
magic tend to be much subtler.
Since the dawn of man, spiritual beliefs and religions cycli-
cally rise, decline and are reborn. People are always looking for
answers, and the Sixth World poses a lot of questions. The
Awakening threw every known religion into chaos and rekin-
dled both reactionary dogmas and old faiths that never quite
died. Fueled by the manifest power of many of its animistic
rites, it isn't surprising that neo-paganism-in a broad sense,
those who follow nature-worship, classical or shamanistic
faiths-drew many new converts. Fifty years hence, it is clear
neo-paganism has had a lasting appeal. Wicca, druidism and
other old faiths claiming roots in ancient Europe pervade all
aspects of European society.
Even so, many Europeans see nature magic as second-
class thaumaturgy. Charles University in Prague and Erfurt in
the AGS are the only three to offer higher degrees in nature
magic. Thanks to the efforts of the Unificationists, more so than
nature magicians themselves, things are slowly changing.
. You can't really speak of paganism except in the broadest
terms. Nordic Ásatru and Wicca may have minor things in
common, but philosophically they're a world apart. Ásatru is
a warrior's religion at heart while Wicca is all about nature
and balance.
· Socio Pat
. Depends which Wiccans you're talking about. The rabid fem-
inists of the Sie follow a radical version of Goddess worship and
are just as militant as a raubritter go-gang.
· Neostradamus
. Whether ultra-feminists or neo-Luddites, Wicca has its share of
extremists too. Even though they're not representative, they
boast a higher profile than most and give the rest of us a cer-
tain, ah, reputation.
. Labrys
Even the stuffiest hermetic will admit that magic, belief
and culture are intertwined. It's important to remember neo-
pagan faiths are religions, and though magic is integral, it is
only one aspect. Also, while neo-pagan faiths do not share a
common creed or cosmology, most do share an interwoven
magical "tradition"-a conceptual framework or mental con-
struct of forces, symbols and correspondences allowing magi-
cians to focus their will and do what they do. A neo-pagan
finds their faith provides them with a metaphysical "paradigm"
(as the academic crowd would put it) regarding the nature of
mana, the use of magic and the origin of spirits, making neo-
pagans far more tolerant of the Awakened. In most communi-
ties, the Awakened are regarded with high esteem and even
perform the duties of a spiritual leader.
. A lot depends on the particular belief. In most druidic com-
munities, the Awakened are considered touched by the gods
and tend to rise to the top of the pile. Asatru see their magi-
cians as the chosen of the gods and they are often dubbed
priests. On the other hand, most Wiccan covens tend to prize
individuality and maintain a balance in their hierarchy
between Awakened and mundane individuals.
· Malleus
. So these guys actually believe Thor and Zeus are out there
somewhere looking down on us?
· GnuB
. Yes and no. There are cults and groups that adhere strictly to
the old ways while some believe the gods of old represent
human archetypes or avatars of elemental forces. I've seen
instances of both, but I'm not stupid enough to make a call
one way or another.
· Magister
. You'll think differently if you ever see Thor riding his chariot
over a Viking gang rampage. Scared the drek out of me!
· Hagar
· Hey Hagar, how about signing up for one of those detox pro-
grams the Scand Union offers?
· Red Erik
A neo-pagan magician's relationship with his deity,
though reminiscent of the relationship between a shaman
and his totem, is a tad more complex. While Native
American cultures are pretty clear on what the higher pow-
ers are and what they stand for, neo-pagan traditions are not.
Each deity boasts a substantial mythology, providing a far
more complex philosophical patchwork and imagery than
the primal archetypes of Native American and African
totems. Though some pagans are inspired by pre-Celtic
shamanistic beliefs (such as the wild druids of Northern
Britain) following animal and nature totems, most dedicate
themselves to elemental nature, particular gods, resurrected
pantheons of old or even complement their pagan beliefs
with hermetic rituals to replace lost rites.
This diversity is particularly obvious when observing dif-
ferent magicians dedicated to the same deity. To one Nordic
gode, Wotan may be the All-Father, font of all wisdom, while
to another he's the war god guiding him in battle. Surprisingly,
these different views are equally accepted by the community
and seen as devotion to different facets of the same power.
Para-sociologists have coined the term "idol" to describe
the specific aspect of a neo-pagan magician as it relates to their
100

patron of choice. The academic opinion, however, deems these
"idols" as simply mental constructs guiding the magician, and
not as a spirit or god. This matter is one of heated debate.
. | don't waste my time arguing whether Wotan is real or not. I
let my spells speak for me!
· Heimdall
. Like it or not, the issue remains unresolved. Is he truly a god or
a construct of your own mind? Professor Miles Swinbourne's
thesis, Metaphysics of Gods and Men, is still mandatory reading
for any Comparative Thaumaturgy post-grad, and thousands
of pages of new arguments are published every year.
· Silicon Mage
As a rule of thumb, a neo-pagan magician should be con-
sidered in the context of his or her religion rather than as a sin-
gular entity. Where North American and African shamanism are
highly individual practices, nature magic in Europe tends to be
communal. The majority of European nature magicians congre-
gate in magical groups of the same belief (covens, circles and
lodges), or at least neo-pagan movements of the same disposi-
tion. Larger groups, such as the French Druidic Revival, the
British NDM and the German Grand Coven boast considerable
influence in cultural and political spheres.
. True enough. The Weisse covens are the heart of German
Wicca. In Scandinavia, the Aesir Society is the driving force of
the Asatru revival and boasts many magically active gode
and gydje priests.
· Kopke
. In Britain, even though many New Druidic Movement druids
and mundane members aren't true pagans, they recognize
the power and symbolism vested in the old ways and incorpo-
rate it into their hermetic styles. In the opposite corner, the
Celtic drulds in the UK, Tir Na nÓg and France truly subscribe to
pre-Christian beliefs and follow the rites of the Ancients.
· Wednesday
. They wouldn't know the "rites of the Ancients" if it parked on
their facel The last of the druids died out millennia ago.
'Reilly

· Myrddin

extent, mago-fascists like Runenthing.
· Audun
. You better believe there are guys who take the old ways to
heart-and I don't mean crazies like Winternight, either. There
are plenty of intelligent people into the neo-pagan revival.
Scandinavia is chock full of back-to-basics types who accept
the Aesir Society's beliefs and philosophies.

WITCHCRAFT RELOADED
For those of you not familiar with me from Magicknet, I'm
what is commonly referred to as a "street witch" in this corner
of the world. What does this mean? Well, it's less a formal
magic tradition and more of a catch-all term for street mages
and urban shamans. I bring it up now because the term "witch"
is tossed around liberally in Europe. The first thing most peo-
ple (even in the shadows) think of in relation to non-hermetic
magic is witchcraft, and for good reason. The most widespread
non-hermetic traditions in Europe are indeed the various vari-
eties of the craft-Wiccan magic, traditional witchcraft and the
hodge-podge wizstyles of street witches.
Wiccans
by Persephone
I could get used to this. First the Helix crew, and now
Mime and Captain Chaos come calling. I must be more popu-
lar than I thought. I'll start by underlining what too many peo-
ple tend to forget: Wicca is an officially recognized faith in
most of Europe, ranking fourth in followers just behind
Catholicism, Orthodox Christianity and Islam. In Germany, the
Netherlands, Britain and the Czech Republic (where I hail from),
Wicca is popular among both mundane and Awakened. The
reactionary Catholicism in Spain and Italy makes the south
slightly prejudiced against Wiccans.
For those of you who've been living in a hole for the past
hundred years, Wicca is a religion of fertility and nature wor-
ship, similar to druidism, but with several significant differ-
ences. The most glaring is the personal relationship Wiccans
possess with the Goddess and the God and the belief that
everyone has some small spark of "talent". Despite claims of a
return to the old ways, we owe as much to nineteenth and
early twentieth century spirituality, modern New Age philoso-
phy and ceremonial hermeticism as to ancient faiths.
Awakened and mundane Wiccans traditionally gather in
covens and circles, numbering less than thirteen members.
Although many claim the contrary, most covens are urban-
based and our religion is rooted in sprawls across the continent.
. Of course, there's no such thing as a single Wiccan faith. Of
all the neo-pagan beliefs, Wicca is the most individualistic and
divided in nature. It seems like each coven has its own set of
beliefs and philosophy.
Green Lady
. That is what kept it from being officially recognized. Pluralism
is good, up to a point.
e Door
Wicca isn't a monolithic creed. Rather, it is a grouping of
several diverse sub-traditions or lineages, as we call them.
So what do Wiccans have in common? Well, several ele-
ments are sufficiently widespread to be considered common
among Wiccans:
102
State of the Art: 2064

Page 95:
OLD WORLD MAGIC
NOVATECH
. Belief in the God and Goddess, who represent the balance
of forces at the heart of nature itself. Different groups envi-
sion different relationships between the two powers, but the
majority acknowledges both.
. The understanding that magic is the essence of all things. It
is the neutral spiritual force, neither inherently good nor evil.
Intrinsic to everything.
· The Wiccan Rede is essentially an ethical code of conduct
rather than a law, and can be summed up in two phrases "An
Ye Harm None, Do What Ye Will." Its interpretation varies sig-
nificantly.
. The Law of Return-also known as the Rule of Three or the
Threefold Law-is one of the legacies of the old ways. In its
most common form, it reads, "Ever Mind The Rule Of Three,
Three Times Your Acts Return To Thee. This Lesson Well,
Thou Must Learn, Thou Only Gets What Thee Dost Earn."
Wicca stands outside the hermetic and shamanic para-
digms. Both paths are seen as equal forms of the "Craft of the
Wise," the harnessing of Earth's natural energy through our
workings. I was trained in the most common form of Wicca in
Europe, the Gardnerian tradition, similar to the hermetic out-
look. The other major branch of Wicca, the nature and fertility
rites of witches following revived Goddess worship is our
direct opposite, closer to shamanism. There are numerous
other lineages, from the feminist "Dianic" Wicca (after the god-
dess Diana) to Celtic Wicca, which shares much of its pantheon
and symbolism with druidism. The "eclectics" combine the
styles and beliefs of various branches into their own creation,
not unlike chaos mages. Though some bickering is natural,
Wicca sub-traditions don't share the one-upmanship seen
among hermetic schools and study circles.
. All Wiccan lineages have slightly different leanings regarding
magic. Magicians tend to associate with the lineages they feel
most comfortable with.
· Imagica
· Gardnerian Wiccans have strictly organized hierarchies.
Many secrets are reserved only for initiates. In some countries,
like Germany and the Czech Republic, covens double as ded-
icated hermetic groups for Wiccan believers.
· Bookworm
· Founded by Zsuzsanna Budapest in the 1970s, the Dianic tradi-
tion is strongly feminist. Many Dianic covens are women-only and
their rituals focus on the Goddess. Though not all are as extreme
as the Sie, some radicals exclude the God altogether.
Socio Pat
. Most Wiccans also subscribe to the immortality of the soul
and karmic balance.
· Green Lady
· Karmic what?
· Kid Code
. Karmic balance-"What comes around, goes around."
Though this applies to all things in life, many believe it even
explains magical drain. When a magician manipulates energy,
he must pay a price. The more energy, the bigger the price.
· Green Lady
Though Wicca is the most widespread neo-pagan tradition
in Europe, thanks to the absence of central organization, inter-
nal bickering, bad publicity and resistance from institutional-
ized religions, we don't possess the political and social clout
you'd expect. Most Wicca communities are small and decen-
tralized. The best organized are by far the German Wiccans,
who are structured in covens, grand covens and a Great Grand
Coven. Grand covens coordinate rather than command the
covens in each region, while the Great Grand Coven represents
them all and throws its weight around on a national level.
Tools of the Craft
So, how does one spot a Wiccan? Personality-wise, Wiccans
aren't particularly conspicuous. In fact, Wiccans are often commu-
nity-minded and blend in well. When all decked out for rites,
Wiccans often wear simple dark robes with cords to denote initia-
tion, but day-to-day they tend towards practical and comfortable
dress. The occasional giveaways are pentacle and crescent medal-
lions, bracelets or tattoos (while not an absolute they are pretty
common) and carrying an athame, or ritual dagger (depending on
which country you're in, this may be considered illegal).
Wiccans of all lineages have a number of common foci and
ritual regalia, used by both shamanic and hermetic magicians:
the traditional athame, bolline (a white-handled cutting knife
used to prepare herbs and ritual materials), sword (ritual, often
owned by the coven as a whole), wand (for manipulating mana
and invoking spirits) and the chalice (heavily symbolic, repre-
sentative of the Goddess). One clear aspect of Wicca's her-
metic heritage is the common practice of each coven possess-
ing a Book of Shadows, which functions as a grimoire and her-
metic library, but also as a link to the coven's avatar (in the case
of magical groups). Candles, staffs, cauldrons and brooms are
also quite common. Fetishes and ritual wares handcrafted in
Brittany, Marienbad and Eastern Europe are particularly popu-
lar among Wiccans, and most of these items can be found at
the local talismonger's shop.
· Mileage will vary depending on where you are. While most
talismongers in Germany and the Netherlands cater to
Wiccans, down in Lisbon, Wiccan lore stores tend to be hidden
away in back alleys and out of the way quarters. Good luck
finding a street dealer for Wiccan materials in Madrid or Rome.
· Restelo
· There's a profitable black market in arcane wares from
Eastern Europe through the Czech Republic. The Doanescu
Rom have a handle on it, but the Cherkezov Vory and Albanian
crews are trying to expand their cut. Smuggling is well worth it
if you're willing to face some cutthroat competition.

Traditional Witchcraft
by Willow
You've all heard of the hallmarks of my craft-hedge
magic, charms, hexes, the evil eye, dousing, herbal lore, mid-
wifery. These are aspects of a distinctly different approach to
witchcraft, more traditional and ancient than Wicca. Witches
like me don't belong to a formal tradition, at least no more so
than the average chaos street mage. Witches don't like to talk
about their workings. They tend to be solitary. Me? I'm a mod-
ern girl and while I won't be spilling any trade secrets, I have
no problem giving Mime a hand.
Weisse frau (Germany), sorcière (France), strega (Italy),
bruja (Spain) or bruxa (Portugal)-these are just some of the
names we go by throughout Europe. Thaumaturgical pundits
refer to us as "traditional" witches. We're the true grassroots
magical tradition of Europe, the wise women-midwives,
seers, herbalists, crones and spirit guides-found in the back-
streets of both sprawls and villages, rooted among minorities
and the underclass, and in the rural areas. At best, our craft is
viewed much like alternative medicine was in the last century;
at worst it is disregarded as fraud.
. Many of the southern countries that publicly denounce
witchcraft have a strange love/hate thing going with tradition-
al witches. Witchcraft remains a complement to the dominant
Catholic mindset and though they often clash, many people
don't mind popping in on the local witch to buy a potion or
have a hex cast on the competition.
· Ozzie
It's worth noting that we are not Wiccans. Wicca implies a
certain belief system and a form of worship, and in truth, most
witches conform closer to fairytale images of hex-casting old
women than neo-pagans. A few are practicing Catholics,
Orthodox, Protestants and Muslims, while others don't sub-
scribe to any form of organized religion, though there is a def-
inite ambiguity towards faith and belief reflected in many
aspects of our magical trappings and paraphernalia. We're
notorious for having no compunctions about incorporating
Christian, neo-pagan and hermetic symbolism into our incanta-
tions. If it works for us, we use it.
Another departure from Wicca is that traditional witches
are almost exclusively women (at least in this part of the world).
Hereditary lore passed down orally from witch to apprentice for
generations. Exceptions are rare and only really occur when a
witch lacks a female heir and the line risks being lost.
· Romany magic has many similarities to witchcraft, and gyp-
sies and witches have all too often been lumped together and
persecuted.
· Ambassador
Witches reject the ritualistic trappings of Wicca and her-
metic high magic, weaving magic the way they always have
through the earthy and subtle power of incantations, poxes,
potions and spirits. We prefer to combine traditional medicine
with strong magic, subtle charms and hexes with basic psy-
chology. We're not exactly a common sight in the shadow com-
munity, but if you cross a witch's path, show some respect. We
aren't flamboyant spellcasters by nature, but never doubt our
power. I might not smite you where you stand, but you might
find it unpleasant to vomit up newts during our next meet.
. And you better believe witch charms work. After a run-in with
Lusiada goons, I was seriously fragged up and developed a
limp. Really got in the way of my work. I ended up taking a
friend's advice and visiting a bruxa. She cooked up this potion
I take to ease the pain and give my leg normal flexibility. Cost
me plenty, but it was worth every penny.
· Xunga XL
. One theory out of Prague is that traditional hedge magic was
originally a Dark Ages form of chaos or street magic, mashing
elements from different traditions and philosophies together
into something unique. Kinda like a proto-Unified Magic Theory.
· Acolyte11
. There's something immensely funny about old hags beating
the eggheads-in-pointy-hats to a metaphysical truth by more
than a thousand years.
· Bookworm
Peculiarities of the Craft
Though a few traditional witches are full-fledged magi-
cians, most of my sisters take a unique approach to the Craft.
Our understanding of magic is slightly different from other tra-
ditions. We believe affecting major changes to the way of things
is begging for trouble from the powers-that-be (whatever they
might be). Instead of learning sorcery like a hermetic, Wiccan or
shaman would, we are taught to weave far more subtle magic.
Many of my sisters make a good living by selling charms.
. Judging by what Willow is saying, I'm assuming they draw a
lot of aspected magicians, but it's hard to tell since there has-
n't been a detailed study of traditional witchcraft. Probably
because disdainful academics and authorities fail to see that
"different" doesn't equal "lesser." Some even claim that witch-
es fake their gift.
· Silicon Mage
· Idiots! A cute young witch in Sarajevo wove a charm into my
favorite gun while I was doing a stint in the Balkans. Saved my
bacon a couple of times.
· Flak Jack.
· I saw a witch do her thing in a small town near the Harz
Mountains. The hex she wove wasn't your normal spellbinding. It
involved some sort of astral construct, a matrix if you will, that
stored the spell primed for use. Never seen anything quite like it.

. Maybe the contempt mages have for witches isn't as simple as
it seems. It's rumored hermetics have been "discovering" and
publishing original formulas for stuff witches have been doing for
years. Anchoring metamagic is just the most blatant example.

Street Witches
by Mime
So when is a witch not a witch? When he's a street witch.
A "street witch" is simply what Europeans call the urban
shamans and street mages that inhabit the edges of main-
stream society. It's a catch-all term for every other magician
who thrives on the streets of our sprawls. What started out as
a snub gained a life of its own and, these days, people like me
bear it with pride.
We count all sorts: independent-minded Wiccans, self-
taught street mages, traditional witches, chaos mages and
black magicians. Though we're a generally disorganized band
of solitary players, there's barely a sprawl in Europe where you
won't find a street witch coven. We're the dropouts, the inde-
pendents, the runners and the 'mongers. Consequently, street
witches represent the majority of the magically active in the
European shadows and on the streets of Paris, Frankfurt and
Vienna. We also number many of the independent talismon-
gers and fixers specializing in arcane wares.
· Remember most Europeans follow the Wicca custom of using
"witch" for both male and female magic users. It's fallen out of
use when referring to mundane Wiccans though.
· Willow
· Street witches tend to be more the loner than neo-pagans and
other magicians, too individualistic to follow the stricter traditions.
· Socio Pat
. True. When they do get together, they form multi-tradition
magical groups. They get along far better with magicians of
other traditions than your average stuffed-shirt hermetic or druid.
· Ergo Sum
· Necessity oblige.
· Leoric
. The Camden Irregulars in Northern London are one such
group. They number street mages, a druid or two, a couple of
adepts and even a Haitian houngan. Some of them freelance
in the shadows, but mostly the group keeps the peace up
around Camden, where the protests are bringing down the
cops something fierce. Depending on who you listen to, they're
either aligned with Pendragon's boys or they're card-carrying
members of the Anarchist Black Cross.
· Citizen Rat
· You get local groups like that all over the place. The anarchist
group Die Autonome Hexe in East Berlin and the Green Cell
Laudstall crew in Amsterdam are two equally politicized
groups. There's many more out there.
· Magocrat
To make things even more confusing-just the way we
like it-there isn't a dominant style or path among street
witches. We're too mismatched a group for anything like
that. You'll never know until you ask if this King Rat person
your fixer is introducing as your street witch backup is a Rat
shaman or a houngan.
A recent trend among urban shamans and street-grown
types on the Helix is their construction of their own patchwork
philosophy from various magical paradigms, similar to the
stylings of the chaos mages. Personally, I'm not too fond of this
hodge-podge approach. Can't get my head around blending
neo-pagan spiritual systems with Gnostic creation myths, mesh-
ing Wicca and Qabbalistic ritualism with classical symbolism; but
street witches have a saying, "Fortune favors whatever works."
· Street witches are pretty common in the shadows, since
their styles and personalities are not exactly corporate
wagemage material. But don't make the mistake of thinking
they're all self-taught spell slingers. More than a few had
Th.Ds or formal training in one tradition or another before
they fell through the cracks.
· Persephone
DRUIDS
by Erwen
Like all things natural, the path of the druid is not straight-
forward. We are the stewards of the Earth for the higher pow-
ers. We are its custodians and healers, but we are also the care-
takers of the balance between nature and man. Contrary to
popular belief, druidism understands this to be a symbiotic
relationship, rather than one of blind deference to nature.
There's considerable evidence druidism predates
European Celtic culture. Some scholars point to roots in
Paleolithic shamanism or to the Indo-European Aryan culture,
while others claim its origin lies with the mysterious Vedic cul-
ture that conquered the peoples of the Indus valley and found-
ed Hinduism. Independent of who originally stumbled upon
the path, most historians believe the Celts absorbed primeval
druidism and made it their own, much in the way it was
engulfed by Christianity. What references to ancient druidism
survive come not from the Celts, but from the cultures of antiq-
uity that encountered them such as the Romans. For centuries
now, scholars, mystics, historians and revivalists have searched
for the revelations and mysteries of druidic culture, slowly piec-
ing together the puzzle that is neo-druidism today.
Though we may never know the paths the ancients
walked, we seek to reclaim the essence of their heritage and
strive to build a spiritual system- a religion and a magic-that
would meet with their approval. Equally, we seek a belief that
serves the needs of today's folk, and the land in which we live.

We hold that the powers of the self (intellect, feeling, intu-
ition, instinct and flesh) refined by the secrets of initiation (wis-
dom, love and power) should be used for the good of the com-
munity. We believe in the immortality and the transmigration of
the soul. When the soul completes its stay and dies, it ascends
to the higher planes where it rests until rebirth and its return to
Abred, the material plane. The work of the druid is to consecrate
the bond between our lives and the spirit of the land, to open
the gates of the soul to the higher mysteries. From these sparse
roots sprang the grand oak that is druidism today, one of the
most widespread shamanic traditions in Europe, with its two
great branches: Celtic druidism and "wild" druidism.
Celtic druids follow a pantheistic nature belief-wherein
the Celtic deities are the primordial avatars of elemental
nature-while wild druids follow a deeply primeval totemic
tradition that allegedly predates Celtic influence.
· Erwen isn't including the Danaan and their bastardization of
Celtic mythology or the New Druidic Movement, who appro-
priate druidic trappings and symbolism for their latent mystical
potency, though they are just dressed-up hermetics. Their
vaunted stewardship of the land has been twisted into egotisti-
cal power-mongering and self-interest.

Like Wicca, neo-druidism is equally a religion and a
magic tradition. It considers both sexes as equal and essen-
tial to natural harmony and boasts both mundane and
Awakened followers. It provides a religious and social con-
text to the faith, however, and there is a clear distinction
between the common follower and the druidic "clergy," a
separation Wicca does not embrace. Though there are local
variations, Awakened members seen as "touched by the
divine" ascend naturally to social preeminence and the title of
druid simply by merit of their gift.
On the other hand, wild druids tend to be mostly hermits
and outsiders, very shamanistic in their views, favoring a
deeper immersion in nature and watching over society from
the outside.

Celtic Druids
By far the most widespread, the Celtic variety of
druidism-sometimes known as the path of Awen is better
organized and politically active than its counterpart. You've
probably all heard of its revival in Tir na nOg, but the faith is
also proving popular in the troubled United Kingdom, Spanish
Galicia, Central Europe and French Brittany, where it's the
dynamo of the populist and influential Aznevezenti drouizel
Breizh (Druidic Revival).
Celtic druids have revived ancient Celtic traditions and cul-
ture wholesale-at least what has been possible to recon-
struct-showing devotion to the sanctity of the land, gods,
heroes and sacred animals of the Celtic pantheon. These vary
slightly from country to country; a Scottish druid will use dif-
ferent names and rites than a Britton or a Spaniard though they
are all still considered a single tradition.
· Examples of such pan-Celtic deities include the great hunter
Herne ("Cernunnos" in Irish, "Hern" in Welsh); Lugos ("Lugh" in
Irish, "Lieu" in Welsh), youthful god of the sun, light and fire;
Nodens ("Nuada" in Irish, "Nudd" in Welsh), otherworld lord and
warrior god; Belenos ("Balor" in Irish, "Beli" in Welsh), solar
grandfather god; and Don ("Danu"), primeval river goddess
and mother of the gods. And those are only the variants on the
British Isles.
· Scholar
. Don't forget the Celtic belief in the sanctity of the land
comes with a warrior ethos and a ritual fascination with
bloodletting.

· Term, you're just asking for a rumble aren't you?
· Cailleach
The druids of old were more than just mystics, they played
an active role in society. They were priests and priestesses,
teachers, healers, philosophers, guardians of lore and judges.
They viewed themselves as an intellectual caste whose pur-
pose was to serve, rather than lead, society. This aspect of our
heritage is why modern Celtic druids see it as our duty to help
guide political and social movements. Druids have been gath-
ering strength in social and cultural movements for decades,
and though individually we subscribe to different ideologies,
we all agree on certain issues. In a modern world of political
indulgence, corporate exploitation and hermetic dominance,
druids often favor the anti-establishment underdogs and eco-
logical causes.
. The Celts are by no means as unified as Erwen makes them
seem. While most druids believe in the traditional role of druids, a
vocal minority believe a return to the old ways is too slow in com-
ing. Wherever they crop up, they're pushing for a new order
within the druidic movement where the three mystical castes-
druids, bards and voi-actively lead society during this transition.
· Maub
. For those who aren't up on their anthropology: voi (also
vates or ovates) were the religious and ceremonial initiates,
true Celtic priests; druids were the mystics and wise men, and
bards were the storytellers and "lore keepers" of the Celts.
· Elijah
. Where they exist-Tir, Brittany and Scotland mostly-the voi
are secretive about their true function and often pass them-
selves off as mere druids, assuming their role as voi in closed
circles devoted to the "true" Celtic ways. If you saw the gore
of their ceremonies, you'd understand why. Of course, this is
seriously frowned upon by mainstream druids, and there
have been a growing number of violent "differences of opin-
ion."
· Carlyle
· The Celts had a thing for the number three. Druidic wisdom
was believed to come in the form of triads: the three gifts of
music-sleep, laughter and tears; the three druidic virtues-
courage, brotherhood and selfless service; the three great
powers-fire, intelligence and life.
· Kinder
The Celtic revival has different expressions throughout
Europe. The High Circle of Alba in Scotland believes the
druid caste should be reserved for the gifted, as do several
smaller groups across the British Isles. This has caused fric-
tion that has kept the British druids from presenting a united
front. Strangely enough, some of these "true" druid circles in
Scotland and England allow hermetic druids admission, as
long as they follow the Celtic ethos-possibly because many
are well placed politically and socially.
In contrast, in my native Brittany, the Druidic Revival
treats "druid" as a title and bestows it upon both Awakened
and mundane elders. Here too, we have idiosyncrasies. As a
reaction to the troubles that have plagued Brittany, the
Revival established a dedicated warrior arm, the Ambact.
Once made up of former French Legionnaires and Euro Wars
vets, the Ambact has attracted a number of adepts drawn to
the ethos of the ancient Celtic warrior of the same name.
· Warrior adepts are not all the Revival attracts. Brittany has
a vibrant cultural scene with a number of Celtic-inspired
music and dance groups (both contemporary and tradition-
al). Adepts of the way of the artist known as "bards" are
common.
· Leoric
In Germany, the Vereinigte Orden der Druiden repre-
sents the Celtic faction, taking a middle-of-the-road stance
and keeping their distance from another druidic group, the
Reichsgroßhain of Germany. The Reichsgroßhain are unex-
pectedly friendly with the Order of Thule and uphold some
pretty radical views. Strangely, many of the younger Orden
druids seem to be taking their cue from the "true" druids
elsewhere.

Wild Druids
It is difficult to speak of our "wild" brethren for a number
of reasons, but primarily due to their self-imposed isolation.
Wild druids tend to be hermits, living in the wilderness, trying
to live in harmony with the natural world. Occasionally, they
gather in small groups or clans, sometimes forming circles for
a particular ritual. They shun modern society, and like other
druids, they hold the land sacred and worship its power.
Though their magic is more primeval, and they worship ani-
mistic, mythical and elemental powers or totems such as Oak,
Wyrm and Moon, we are much alike. I am told there are
remarkable similarities between this form of druidism and both
North American and Central Asian shamanism. Perhaps it is
true we all share common roots.
· The similarities are more than just appearances. Any anthro-
pologist can see the evolution of a totemic Stag to the Horned
Man, to Celtic Herne and Cernunnos.
. LepreCon
Wild druids are found in the wilderness throughout
Europe, from the Scottish Wildlands to Spain's Asturian forests
to the rural areas of the Czech Republic. Some even whisper of
wild druids living in the hostile Awakened forests such as the
ones in Spain and Scandinavia, though these might in truth be
fallen druids who follow the dark paths.
Wanderers
A few druids are known as "wanderers." These druids
have chosen to remain outside of circles and instead honor the
land alone, walking its length and breadth on obscure quests
for their patron deities and totems. They follow the shamanic
conviction that the magician should be an outsider, an impar-
tial guardian of all the land and its people.
· Wanderers aren't really restricted to one branch of druidism
or another; both feel the call. Don't be surprised to find one on
his "walkabout" in Seattle or Denver either, these guys are noto-
rious for getting round.
· Silicon Mage
. There's some evidence that ancient druids traveled to the
British Isles from all over Europe to be trained in the higher mys-
teries. This may have contributed to the relative homogeneity
of pan-Celtic culture, but it suggests they were less attached to
specific communities as modern scholars believe. I wonder if it
had anything to do with the high number of aspected power
sites across Britain.
· Elijah
Common Grounds
There are many similarities between the two branches of
druidism and the differences may simply be more philosophi-
cal than practical. In fact, wild and Celtic druids have been
known to cooperate on numerous occasions, most recently
and visibly in the weaving of a new Wild Ley in the British Isles.
Most druids, irrespective of cultural orientation, seek a cir-
cle even before initiation. Circles are the backbone of
Awakened druidic society. During ritual work, most circle
druids use ceremonial robes of white and gray with elaborate
brooches and torques to denote rank and initiation. In the
Celtic rite, the eldest druid always leads the proceedings,
regardless of rank.
. The hermetic wannabes in the NDM Imitate the getup too.
Bunch of wankers.
· Beeste
Mundanes sometimes participate in rituals as a token of
our respect and bond to our communities. While different cul-
tures celebrate different days, there are four major annual fes-
tivals of immense ritual significance celebrated by all druids:
Imbolc, Beltane, Lugnasad and Samhain. Druids often reserve
great rituals for these festivals (as was the case with the
unleashing of the Wild Ley during the Summer Solstice of
2064) and always reserve initiation rites and ordeals for those
sacred occasions.
The power sites used for our gatherings and ritual spell
work are considered communal property, shared by all druids.
These sites vary from monolithic stone circles and natural caves
to hidden glades and burial mounds. All are sacred ground.
Although a number of ancient sites and stone circles fall on nat-
ural power sites and ley nexi-further evidence of the power of
our ancestors-modern druids are trained in geomancy and
sensing techniques. When a new circle is laid, it is almost
always placed on a conveniently located power site. Many
such sites are slowly Aspected towards druidic magic while
others seem to boast a natural affinity.
. Which explains what's been going on in Britain over the last
few years. The Celtic and wild factions are trying to reverse the
aspecting covertly carried out by the NDM on the old henges
and ley nexi. It all hit the headlines with the Callanish incident a
couple of years back, but last summer it really heated up when
they tapped an entirely new ley which re-aspected all the sites
along its course. The NDM called on the Lord Protector and the
Ministry of Defense and they sent in the SAS and Oversight
Templars to secure the sites. Apparently, the lads had their
noses rubbed in it by the druids.
· Myrddin
. Some of the newer circles are unwittingly built on unstable
power sites and are sometimes subject to strange mana fluctua-
tions and phenomena. Since the mana surges of '61, there have
been reports of some of these opening up astral rifts and shallows.
· Maub
. Another peculiarity seems to be that a druid's power over
nature spirits is enhanced when in close proximity to henges
and circles. Something to do with being particularly attuned to
those domains.

NORSE PAGANS
by Mime
The old Norse paganism, Ásatru, has gotten a remarkable
boost in Scandinavia in recent decades. Scandinavians have
quite a relaxed attitude towards religion and magic, yet on
the fringes of their society, a different mentality is growing.
Ásatru has been embraced by the members of a loose
network of raider and biker clans known as Vikings, which
grew out of a cultural fusion of criminal biker gangs, neo-nazi
groups and the Scandinavian heavy metal scene. Not really a
surprise, as their lifestyle harkens back to that of the old Norse.
To a corp suit, the idea of dying in battle to ascend to Valhalla
isn't particularly enticing, but to a North Sea pirate, the idea is
a bit more relevant.
Ásatru has also been adopted by the Siida communities,
which offer an alternative to those who fit in with the modern
urban rat race. Metas, neo-Luddites and those looking for a new
start flock to these communities or start their own in the desert-
ed Scandinavian interior. The Siida provide the Vikings with safe
havens along the Norwegian coast and the Vikings recruit from
the youths who've grown tired of the Siida's quiet life.
This revival of Norse paganism isn't formalized and lacks
any central organization. Each group, be it a pirate crew, a
Viking street gang or a Siida village, has a gode (priest) or
gydje (priestess) as their connection to the gods. As with
other neo-pagans, these are often Awakened individuals.
An exception to the disorganization of most Ásatru is the
Aesir Society. Making its home in Uppsala, Sweden, it has
spread throughout Scandinavia and recruits all kinds. It has a
more typical neo-pagan outlook, preaching a gospel of how
the old Norse had things right. They prefer to live in farming
villages and compounds owned by the sect, trying to live
more like the ancients. They're much more peaceful than the
Vikings who they believe "bring shame upon the Aesir."
· It's the Aesir Society that brings shame upon the gods. The
weaklings prefer to go the frozen wastes of Hel than die like
true men.
· Jotun
Not all magicians among the Norse pagans, however, act
as priests. A volve is a special kind of priestess claiming to
have a unique spiritual bond with Norns, the goddesses of
Fate; a ganner is your typical spell slinger; a seidman falls into
wild trances to perform their brand of ritual magic or to con-
jure spirits; and a runemaster uses runes to enhance his magic.
Runemasters seem to have learned (some claim “rediscov-
ered") a unique enchanting technique, where the rune carving
imbues foci with additional potency.
· Runecasting is a difficult skill to master. Each rune has a spe-
cial meaning that changes when combined with another.
Runes may also limit the use of the focus, making it vulnerable
to steel or sunlight or requiring you to do things like pour beer
on it to make it work.

. I thought runes were used in divination?
· Wiz Kid
. They are, but among traditionalist Norse pagans the practice
is frowned upon. There's no real indication of the ancient
Scandinavians using runes for divination, at least not in the
manner favored by street witches. Norse pagans who prefer to
"stay true" avoid this modern adaptation. Not all seem to care
much, though. Knowledge is power after all.
· Sunnica
Possibly the most infamous variety are berserkers, warriors
that display magical abilities when in a combat frenzy. Most of
these appear to be some form of adept, but there are those
who display a wider range of powers. Typically, berserkers use
drugs or drink to induce the frenzy. Local magic mushrooms
and imported Awakened drugs are very popular, though some
seem to be able to "go berserk" at will.
· Berserkers in action are a scary sight. They look like wild ani-
mals, but don't be fooled, they'll fight with the precision of a
martial arts adept.
· Ola Krok
· Some do in fact look like wild animals when they go into fren-
zy. When I first saw it, I thought the guy was a shifter, but a Sami
friend says it's some kind of shamanic mask.
· Rodina
Norse magic is essentially shamanistic and pantheistic.
While most devote themselves to the entire pantheon equally,
others dedicate themselves to a particular Ás (singular of Aesir).
The cults of Odin and Thor are the most popular. Both are
essentially warrior cults, though the Odin devotees are slightly
more mystical than Thor worshippers, who are known to party
hard, drink harder and brawl hardest. The cults of the Vanir are
slightly more peaceful, focusing on the nature and fertility
deities of Norse lore and resembling Wiccans in outlook.
They're most popular among the Siida, but there's no real fric-
tion between the cults. The real schism among the Norse
pagans is regarding metahumans. Some view metas as incar-
nations of the Jotnir, the mythic enemies of the Aesir, while
others openly accept metas, showing how mixed the founda-
tions of Norse neo-paganism really are.
Both Awakened and mundane Ásatru gather for great cere-
monies known as blots based on the ancient custom. These are
usually held on Midsummer's or Midwinter's Day and the spring
or autumn equinoxes, but also happen whenever there's a good
enough reason. Among the Vikings-where the blots are most
popular-these might at first seem like a typical rock or biker fes-
tival, but the animal sacrifices, drinking of blood and scary reli-
gious and magical rituals are eye-openers.
. Doesn't that imply blood magic? They sacrifice animals and
do magic-shouldn't there be a bounty on these guys?
· Set
. Some guys tried to collect a bounty on some Vikings last year,
but the Dunkelzahn Foundation in Copenhagen let them loose.
Seems like the sacrifice was strictly religious in nature and there's
no bounty on that. Though it is illegal to sacrifice animals in the
Scand Union, I don't think the Vikings care much about the law.
· Hugin
. Still, many Norse magicians are initiated during blots, and they
believe bloodletting enhances the magic performed during the
rituals. Maybe those sacrifices aren't so "innocent" after all.
· Red Erik
ROMAN-HELLENISTIC PAGANS
While the Norse pantheon has found a fiery following in
Scandinavia, the Roman and Hellenistic pantheons have seen a
slow burn revival in southern Europe. The ancient beliefs of
Greek and Roman mysticism are probably the best recorded in
history and many have turned to this well of knowledge.
Wiccans and street witches borrow heavily from classical
mythology to shore up their own traditions, but among the
small neo-pagan groups truly dedicated to a revival of these
beliefs, a few stand out.
The most influential is the Oracle of Delphos. At first glance,
they're a magical and pagan group dedicated to the worship of
Apollo, revitalizing the ancient tradition of the Oracle and offer-
ing divination to anyone who's willing to make an "offering to the
Gods." They also operate as a consultancy firm, which even
boasts a councilor seat on the Hellenic Federal Council. Their
power springs from control of the potent power site of Delphos
and the lesser known Larissa site. According to speculation, these
sites are naturally aspected towards divination. Aside from its
consultancy business-known as Orakle-the group is also
involved in several nature conservation projects in the Epiros and
the Cyclid Islands. During the past few years, growing competi-
tion from the now-international French Seer's Guild has prompt-
ed Orakle to become more business-like and expand beyond
Greece. Though limited to the initiates of the Cult of Apollo, the
Greek group now has offices in several Mediterranean countries,
including Italy, Spain, Constantinople and Tunisia.
. Buzz in Athens is that Orakle is doing well on the stock market,
defying common knowledge that divination can't predict with
precision.
· Verby
. I don't think so. Even the Seers can't pull that one off. It's
more likely a case of making things happen. Orakle is rich
enough to hire not-so-spiritual guides to see things get done.
· 01110110111
· Doesn't anyone wonder where the group got all its funding?
Of course they make a bundle on divination services, but when
they started off in the '40s, Greece was a country ravaged by
war. Their temple was up and running mere months after the
group got together for the first time.

Another group is the Orpheists. The modern variant focus-
es on Dionysian rites and the Orphic ideal of mysticism and
artistry embodied by the original pre-Platonic Orpheists-not
unlike Eastern Tantric traditions. They've borrowed heavily from
later traditions and cults to fill in the gaps though. Like the trou-
badours of antiquity, they believe in the divine power of voice
and music and in living life to the fullest, often assuming deeply
hedonistic lifestyles. They number a few Awakened, both artis-
tic adepts and magicians, and are sometimes found performing
to crowds of adolescent fans on sprawl corners throughout
Europe. It's in the isolated communities of Italian Mezzogiorno,
however, that they're most common, where their hedonistic
mysticism and artful magic finds easier acceptance.
A small group definitely worth mentioning is the
Aesculepian brotherhood. The Aesculepian cult mixes classic
mysticism, traditional medicine and herbal lore to great effect.
These traveling magical healers adopt a mendicant lifestyle
reminiscent of Dark Ages friars; always on the move, working
in exchange for gifts, room and board, and always searching
for something nobody has been able to figure out. Their selfless
vocation makes them very popular in isolated communities,
war-torn countries and lawless places like GeMiTo. The locals
will go out of their way to protect them.
There are several smaller groups dedicated to either the
Greek or Roman pantheon sprinkled across Greece, Italy and
the rest of Southern Europe. Both the Orthodox and Catholic
churches oppose the growing popularity of these pagans as
best they can, but popular culture seems to love the old pan-
theons. The Roman and Hellenistic groups draw followers from
all over the world, but most relocate to the Mediterranean, the
cradle of their beliefs.
. There are a couple of major sims in the works this year
based on classical mythology. Expect an upswing in interest
in these flakes.
· Valens
ETHNIC MAGIC
To round out the undercurrent in the European magic
scene, I must mention the many non-European ethnic tradi-
tions. Leading the underdogs are the Muslims, by far the largest
European cultural minority with more than 15 million people.
Since the Second Ottoman Jihad, Muslims-even those who are
third and fourth generation Europeans-have suffered preju-
dice, discrimination and sometimes outright hatred.
. Too true. In many parts of Europe, it's easier to be an ork than
to be a Muslim, be you Algerian, Somali, Turkish, Arab, Pakistani
or Albanian.
. Almond White
. European Muslims got the sharp end of the stick, even though
many actively opposed the Jihad. Some even fought in the
ranks of the French Foreign Legion and MET2000 in Spain and
later Greece, but still they're seen as the enemy.
· Ambassador
The end result is that most Muslim communities have fold-
ed in on themselves and Islamic movements aren't doing much
to change it. While European Muslims are far more open
regarding metahumans and magic than some of their Middle
Eastern brethren, they find it very hard to find acceptance in
academic circles and develop their talents outside their com-
munities. Many join madrassas (religious schools attached to
mosques) or travel to the Maghreb and less radical nations of
the Middle East to receive formal training at the hands of
Awakened imams and mullahs. Some follow the Sufi dervish
tradition; a few learn Arabian alchemy and many adepts and
mages are trained by the Jamil Islamiah into muhajedin,
guardians of the faith. Those that do return often join politicized
Islamic policlubs from radicals like Jihad X to the reformers of
the Moorish-inspired Islamic Renaissance Movement.
Other major ethnic groups include the Romany, the East
Indians, Chinese and Africans, all of which have brought their
traditions with them. Their influence is quite localized, and
among the relevant ethnic groups, they occupy the same role
traditional witchcraft does within European under classes.
. There are exceptions of course. Prague, Berlin and
Merseysprawl are particularly open, and in the first two there
are even numeros clausos at the universities for students of non-
European magical traditions.
· Ersatz
. Doesn't mean they fit in.
· Acolyte11
Romany witchcraft is pervasive. Gypsies are present in
almost every European nation from Ireland to Russia and their
culture is steeped in little understood mysticism even today.
We believe their magic resembles traditional witchcraft, but
gypsies are notoriously insular and reserved about their
secrets, preferring to let speculation do its job instead.
. Don't you believe it! Last month I saw a Rom smuggler in
Katowice hold off a nosferatu working for the local syndikat
with a brace of flashy spells. Nothing "subtle" about them.
· Oczyniebieskie
Wujen has its niche among the thriving East Asian com-
munities in Britain and France, and is actually better accepted
than many of its counterparts. Most wujen magicians find it rel-
atively easy to find gainful employment and fewer trickle down
to the shadows than you would expect. The Triads, particularly
in the UK, employ a number of wujen, preferring to keep things
"in the family." Voudoun and Santeria have a place among the
numerous West Indian populations in Britain, UNL and
Scandinavia where they provide a strong cultural focus for the
local communities and sometimes act as magical protectors.
African shamanism and witchcraft are less common but are
found in popular ports, merc hangouts and pirate havens like
Lisbon and the Canary islands. Hindu mysticism, mostly cen-
tered on the UK where there's a sizeable Indian minority,

remains secretive, though it's a common knowledge Brahmin
only use magic to aid Hindustanis.
Finally, there are several small primitive shamanistic tradi-
tions spread throughout Europe, such as Lappish shamans and
Balkan animists, rooted in ethnic minorities. As I said before,
our cauldron contains a very interesting mix.
A QUESTION OF PARADIGM
by Flamel
If you're meddling in anything involving mages in the
European shadows, you should be aware of the academic con-
flict. In Europe, different schools of thought-or "paradigms,"
as the academics like to call them-are locked in a race for
dominance over the hermetic magic scene, leading to an
extremely diverse landscape. The conflict mainly affects the
universities and research labs, but since the victors stand to
gain considerable prestige and influence (not to mention the
big bucks from corporate interests), myriad agents meddle in
the conflict hoping to reap the results of this magical arms race.
The conflict also affects North America, though not to the same
extent due to the heavy dominance of one particular paradigm
there-Renewed Hermeticism.
But let's back up a little. Observation and logic are not
absolutes when it comes to magic. There's no "what goes up
must come down." Thaumaturgy constantly bends the estab-
lished laws of reality and physics out of shape. What's more,
the very nature of magic is such that different theories regard-
ing the nature of magic not only exist, but cannot be objec-
tively disproved by empirical testing and comparison. This
happens not only between different magical traditions but also
within monolithic hermeticism. These are known as paradigms.
Each paradigm can be thought of as a distinctive school of
hermetic magic-a basic theoretical framework defining funda-
mental principles, accepted methodologies, philosophy, ideol-
ogy and metaphysics describing the ultimate nature of magic
and the world.
Paradigms, however, are not absolute and complete sys-
tems of magical theory. Each still harbors huge debates and
vast gaps in theory. Hypotheses are debated, revised and
developed within dedicated study circles and conferences, and
through publications by the scholars that support them. These
are the main actors in "the academic conflict," the race to
define which paradigm is most efficient, versatile and effective.
While the academic nature of the conflict may make it seem
inconsequential to a layman, the amount of money, break-
through developments and new theories it generates make it
extremely interesting for anyone from a Saeder-Krupp senior
exec to a lowly shadowrunner.
. The competition extends beyond the academic spheres.
Since most wagemages have a Th.D., corporations usually
align with one of the paradigms, depending on where they
recruit their magical talent. This is mostly for practical reasons,
since mages of different paradigms usually have difficulties
working together. Only megacorps can afford to split up their
magical departments, not relying on only one school.
· Gemini
. And people wonder why I can't stand hermetics!
· Halo
. They probably don't like you either.
· Killjoy
ROOTS OF CONFLICT
To understand how the different paradigms developed,
we have to skip back to the beginning of the century, or the
"dawn of the Sixth World" as the history trids call it. When the
initial shock of the Awakening loosened its grip, people tried to
adapt. The ability to wield magic was rare and barely under-
stood at the time. Feverish research in the then United States
was soon dominated by military concerns, leading to a very
scientific and rational approach, directed at discovering how to
control this new power and only secondarily, what is it?
. More accurately, how the hell can we counter the Great
Ghost Dance?
· Beach Boy
While government agencies and megacorporations led
thaumaturgical development in North America, public and pri-
vate universities led the charge in Europe. By late 2012, multi-
ple programs had been instituted on both sides of the Atlantic
to study the new phenomena, but it would take decades for
scholars to catch up with harbingers like Howling Coyote's
shamans and the New IRA, who had an inexplicable head start
over everyone else.
Early studies were hampered by scientific preconceptions
that tried to rationalize mana through modern science, believing
it to be a manifestation of some other known force.
Parapsychological approaches did produce minor results, howev-
er, and the military soon started to recruit and train "psionicists."
Some of these still linger and there's actually a Psionic Studies
Institute in New Jersey that still holds on to the antiquated views.
Despite the tentative advances in America, most European
research took an entirely different tack. Ravaged by eco-catastro-
phes, Europe saw magic as a potential answer to its prayers, and
research was much more diverse. Given the obvious Awakened
power of traditional magic in America, Ireland and Asia,
European scholars went looking to the past for answers exploring
different avenues. They soon discovered that in the right hands,
the rituals described in ancient texts sometimes produced extra-
ordinary results. Though unimpressive by today's standards-
most of the early spells didn't actually do much-the fact that
they did something was a breakthrough. This led towards a rekin-
dling of mystical traditions of antiquity from classical sources like
the Codex Hermeticum and other less known works.
Charles University in Prague was the first to establish an
actual Hermetic Studies curriculum in 2016; others quickly fol-
lowed. Such programs received significant backing in Europe,
less so in an America shaken and apprehensive in the after-
math of the Great Ghost Dance. What would become known as
Classic Hermeticism soon ruled academic circles, though folk-
lore and nature magic also proved valid models as the druidic
and Teutonic variants would later demonstrate.

When the shift in American academia came however, it
proved decisive. Born not from the undeniable power of
shamanism, but from the seminal work of Akiko Keno and Arthur
White Eagle, it introduced an entirely new methodology built on
the foundations of hermeticism, but which remained scientific in
nature. Extrapolating upon classic hermetic theory, they devel-
oped a theoretical paradigm that convinced the "rationalist" sci-
entific community that magic should be viewed as a science in
its own right. This melding of classic lore and modern conceptu-
alization was revolutionary, and Keno and White Eagle's work
influenced even the most die-hard Classicists in Europe. What
became known as Renewed Hermeticism, however, also first
divided the hermetic tradition between traditionalists and
reformists and ignited the academic conflict as we know it today.
Magical studies have come a long way and hermeticism
has become even more splintered as new paradigms and the-
ories evolve. In a world where everyone wants a piece of the
pie, it was inevitable that academics throughout the world
would begin to compete for resources and influence.
Megacorps and governments want any extra magical edge
they can get. They sponsor and recruit from different schools,
fostering this magical arms race in the hopes of profiting from
the inevitable results of the quest for a better hermetic.
. If you thought industrial and high-tech R&D was scalding hot
paydata, you should see what corps fork out for thaumaturgi-
cal breakthroughs. This whole "academic conflict" thing
means plenty of pickings for us in the shadows.

RULES OF THE GAME
This is a battle of influence and there are two ways of mea-
suring it: prestige and human resources. Prestige comes to
those who produce the best results. Since all forms of magic
actually work (from psionics to the Cult of the Great Toaster),
the name of the game is to demonstrate how your approach
works better. Major innovations bolster the prestige of a
research lab or magical group, but also the reputation of the
entire paradigm from which they derive. Though paradigms
are quick to incorporate any "new" developments discovered
by rival philosophies, there isn't much fame in being a copycat,
is there? This leads to great secrecy surrounding major
research projects, and consequently, to well-paying work for
"curiosity seekers."
. If every researcher in Prague spent as much time on his own
work as he spends on watching everybody else, we would
probably get a revolutionary breakthrough every week.

Human resources are the other half of the coin. Magical
talent is uncommon. Magical innovators are even more rare.
The more people on your side the better, but not everyone is
of equal interest. The most talented individuals are sought
after, and this is where "study circles" enter the picture. Study
circles are magical associations (almost like fraternities) con-
nected to universities and research labs, each pursuing a par-
adigm and internal agenda. One could claim the whole con-
flict is actually a rat race between competing study circles.
Originally, university students formed these circles for sup-
port in their studies, but many have grown into significantly
more. Uniting like-minded people, many circles develop
agendas beyond mere academic support-some gain politi-
cal agendas, others develop into "good ol' boys" networks,
some even become mystic mafias. Many of the magical orga-
nizations you've heard of like the Illuminates of the New
Dawn (IOND) and the New Druidic Movement (NDM) began
as study circles.
e I thought the IOND traced their roots back to the Bavarian
Illuminati in the eighteenth century.
· Scorpio
. Don't take everything you read at face value.
· Skeptic
Like many magical groups, study circles offer lifetime
membership. Simply because you've earned your Th.D. does-
n't mean you have to leave. Indeed, former alumni are the keys
to power for most study circles. When firmly entrenched at a
corp, they ensure funding for the "right" student programs and
provide connections to powerful sponsors and possible
employers for the next generation. Becoming a member of a
study circle often means you're assured a job right out of col-
lege. This is just as much a benefit for the corporations as it is
for the students. Magical talent is in high demand and the
study circles provide a ready source. Some study circles have
undoubtedly become little more than recruiting fronts for cor-
porations, though others maintain their independence by not
relying solely on one backer.
e Corps also play these groups off each other, as much as the
other way round. MCT and S-K are all over the Sorbonne and
Charles campuses financing groups and snatching up bloom-
ing talent and research results. Meanwhile the groups are using
the corp cash to finance their own interests.

official curriculum. Larger universities are academic "battle
zones" where several study circles and paradigms compete in
perpetual academic one-upmanship. Though less common,
some universities have reacted to the emergence of different
hermetic paradigms and have divided their magical faculty into
several smaller departments, each with a different curriculum
and research programs.
. How large are these things? There aren't that many
Awakened out there, and even with sponsorships and scholar-
ships not everyone is cut out for university life.

Faustus Society.

THE CLASSIC SCHOOLS
The Classic Schools do not represent a single paradigm, but
rather many. They are what early European magic scholars
developed from pre-Awakened occultism and mystical tradi-
tions. While they appear very different in outlook, many argue
the differences between them are more cultural than philo-
sophical and that they really should be understood as a single
paradigm. The most common Classic Schools are Classic
Hermeticism, Qabbalah, Egyptian Hermeticism, Black Magic
and the variants Hermetic Druidism and Teutonic Hermetic.
Some also include the Asian wujen and other non-European
magical systems among the Classic Schools, though these have
negligible influence in Europe.
What should be understood is that the Classic Schools
aren't mere scientific frameworks, but entire spiritual and philo-
sophical systems. Without a proper understanding of the phi-
losophy, you won't be able to understand the old texts that
form the foundation of these schools. Mages belonging to the
Classic Schools adopt the whole package, and are thus natural-
ly opposed to the Renewed Hermetics who focus solely on the
magic elements. This doesn't prevent in-fighting between the
Classic Schools, though.
Classic Hermeticism
Most Important Universities: Athens (FRH), Cologne (AGS),
Madrid (Spain), Venice (Italian Confederation)
Famous Study Circles: Society of Elemental Studies, The
International Order of Hermes
Publications of Note: The Trismegistus Review, The Elemental
Quarterly, Journal of Hermetic Thought
Classic Hermetics, or simply Classicists, argue that the
ancients knew far more about magic than we currently do and
thus metahumanity should seek to learn from them instead of
"trying to reinvent the wheel." Their initial successes back up
this claim, but further evidence is inconclusive. Their primary
references are the works attributed to Hermes Trismegistus,
State of the Art: 2064
114

Page 107:

NOVATECH
written in the first centuries before and after Christ. These texts,
the Corpus Hermeticum, are the root of the hermetic tradition,
but even the Classicists expand on these and draw upon a vari-
ety of ancient sources: Qabbalah, medieval grimoires, Egyptian
parchments, Rosicrucian ritualism and even nineteenth and
twentieth century occultism. This creates a certain overlap with
smaller sub-traditions, both hermetic and otherwise.
. Note that they always refer to original texts. Latin and ancient
Greek are compulsory for a true Classicist.
· Schiller Undergrad
Classicists were the first successful hermetics and their
models form the basis for all later theory. Understanding their
approach is fundamental in understanding all others. The base
precept is that mana is the mythical quintessence of the uni-
verse. While they don't deny the value of hard science,
Classicists view magic-the "spiritual axis of the universe"-as
inherently superior. Mana is mind, energy and matter, making
those distinctions illusory. Magic is thus beyond pure science;
it is the highest art form available to mankind-an art that
demands deep understanding of philosophy, ethics, science
and artistic creativity, making the path of the magician the path
of true enlightenment.
That bit is similar to the propaganda spewed by the
Illuminates of the New Dawn, though they recruit mostly from
Renewed Hermetic circles. In their case, it is more propagan-
da and high ideals than a pragmatic approach. There's a
small Classicist faction in the Paris IOND chapter, which is lob-
bying for change.
· Idle Savant
. So Classicist study circles are simply a worse version of the
IOND?
· Fletch
. Some are, but most Classicists oppose the idea of a magoc-
racy. They think mundane matters would take their minds away
from "the high art." Many Classicists believe enlightenment is
actually available to all of metahumanity. The Gifted simply
have a short cut, but there are other paths. Some even believe
anyone can awaken to magic if they seek hard enough.
e Carabas
A fundamental aspect of Classic Hermeticism is the focus
upon the four elements, the building blocks of their meta-
physics, which not only correspond with basic natural forces,
but also have mystical affinities to human spirits. Though spiri-
tual balance between these forces is the ideal, some devote
their focus to one particular element. Hard-line Classicists often
frown upon such "misguided" approaches, but elementalists
gain much from their specializations.
Classicists are a major presence in France and around the
Mediterranean, where they form small study circles associat-
ed with particular universities. This doesn't mean they lack
organization, but rather that they opt to link up around publi-
cations and conferences rather than magical groups. The
exceptions are the International Order of Hermes (IOH) and
the Society of Elemental Studies (SES). The IOH represents
hard-line Classicists, dedicated to upholding the ethical stan-
dards in the hermetic discipline and focusing strongly on the
spiritual and transcendental aspects of magic. The SES shares
the concern for ethical standards, but focuses upon magical
research, especially in the fields of astral constructs and con-
juration. In fact, SES patented invocation metamagic. This has
made them a strong contestant in the academic conflict, not
to mention their close ties to several corporations, including S-
K and Sol Media.
To date, though the Classicists have been able to keep up
with more modern paradigms, their outlook allows little room
for innovation and fewer ancient texts have been uncovered in
recent years. The well of knowledge from the ancients seems
to be drying up. They are dogmatic regarding their hermetic
strictures and systems, too much so for many young practi-
tioners. In outlook and magical style, Classicists are as tradi-
tional as they come.
. To counter this problem, some Classicists have devoted their
attention to arcano-archeology. The DIMR and Atlantean
Foundation have openly welcomed cooperation, though the
pop version of Atlantis pushed by the Foundation doesn't
appeal to most Classicists.
· Augustus Max
· A more potent, but still untapped well of knowledge, are the
Vatican libraries. A long lasting dispute with Rome rages on, as
petitions to the pope by several universities for access have
been rejected multiple times. Many classic hermetics feel the

from the public.

Hermetic Druidism is an off-shoot of Classical
Hermeticism, with a slightly different focus. Rather than the
path of enlightenment, Hermetic Druids try to embody the
Celtic ideal of the druid as a philosopher, wise man and
astrologer. According to the New Druidic Movement,
Hermetic Druidism is the true modern inheritor of the old Celtic

magical and philosophical heritage. Though essentially her-
metic, it blends neo-pagan and ancient Celtic symbolism with
hermetic trappings and formula, with a strong emphasis on
ecology and conservationism in general.
Like Classicists, Hermetic Druids view mana as the quin-
tessence of the natural world. Hermetic Druids, however, see
elementals as spiritual representations of their true element,
rather than the typical hermetic concept of para-elemental
states. They conjure elementals of earth, sky, sea, lightning and
fire instead of elementals of earth, air, water and fire. Most the-
orists believe these elementals are simply peculiar manifesta-
tions of those other hermetics conjure. Like their nature-rever-
ing cousins, Hermetic Druids have developed an affinity for
geomancy, druidic power sites, the ancient calendar as well as
an aptitude for astrology and artificing.
The stronghold of Hermetic Druidism is England, where it
completely dominates the magic scene. Though there are
some Hermetic Druids throughout Europe, most notably in
Spain, Germany and France, they mostly take their cue from
the UK universities. The New Druidic Movement, besides being
a political mainstay in the UK, is also the main "study circle" for
Hermetic Druidism. Their inner circles form at universities and
membership in a circle (and thus the NDM itself) is almost
mandatory at Cambridge and Oxford.
. Though half of the talented in UK are Hermetic Druids, most
foreign corps are reluctant to hire them on-they don't trust
their ties to the NDM. This gives the University of Edinburgh
crowd, who boast the most supporters of the Unified Magic
Theory and Renewed Hermeticism, a slight edge.
· John Dee
. Dissention in the ranks of the NDM is at an all-time high.

see trouble brewing.

Teutonic Hermetics
Most Important Universities: Erfurt (AGS), Uppsala (Sweden)
Famous Study Circles: Order of Thule
Publications of Note: The Saxo Review
The craft of Teutonic Hermetic mages is inspired by
ancient Norse and Germanic mysticism. Their underlying magic
theory is similar to Hermetic Druidism, but boasts enough idio-
syncrasies to classify it as a distinct paradigm. Most peculiar is
the theory of "eternal ice." Eternal ice is seen as a cosmic force,
the natural opposite of mana, encapsulating the Gaiasphere.
The ebbs and tides of this great eternal ice cyclically crush the
Gaiasphere and metahumanity. The Teutonics are also fierce
believers in a previous age of magic, symbolized by the myth-
ical nation of Thule. The Order of Thule, the best known
Teutonic study circle, is dedicated to "creating a renaissance of
the magic of Thule." Regardless, the Teutonics are so few in
number that if it weren't for their development of runic
enchanting they wouldn't be worth mentioning.
. Except they more or less lifted the process wholesale from the
Aesir Society, claiming it as their own.

Other Minor Classic Schools
There are several off-shoots of Classic Hermeticism that
don't really participate in the academic conflict. Both Hermetic
and Orthodox Qabbalah have a significant presence in Prague,
Vienna, Budapest and New York. Egyptian magic saw a surge
in popularity in the UK early in the century, rivaling the Classic
Hermetics, but the influence of the NDM has since routed this
school. Black Magic, or Magick as it is properly known, a twen-
tieth century occult tradition, retains a few followers, but with
the exception of a few minor colleges, this tradition has no sig-
nificant presence anywhere.

MODERN SCHOOLS
The main competition to the Classicists are the so-called
Modern Schools: the Renewed Hermetics, Reformed Ritualists,
Avant-Gardists and Unified Magicians.
Renewed Hermeticism
Most Important Universities: MIT&T (UCAS), Washington
(UCAS), Prague (Czech Rep), Paris (France), Tokyo (JIS)
Famous Study Circles: Renewed Order of Hermes, Groupe X-
Polytechnique, the Hawkins Group
Publications of Note: Journal of Magical Theory, Hermetic Digest
Renewed Hermeticism is the scientific brother and rival to
Classic Hermeticism. Though they share much, the schism
between them is the deepest among the paradigms. The off-
spring of parapsychological methodology and hermetic theory,
fused into a scientific approach to thaumaturgy, Renewed
Hermeticism is rooted in the works of Kano and White Eagle,
the theorists behind the "magical revolution" in the '20s and
'30s, who eventually got the first Nobel Memorial Prize.
Renewed Hermetics claim the source of magic is found
beyond the pre-Awakening model of the universe. Unlike the
Classicists, they view mana as a form of energy, though with dif-
ferent properties than other forms of ambient energy like matter,
light and electricity. To the Renewed Hermetic, magic is simply
an arcane science. The spiritual is a Jungian ideal imprinted on
malleable astral space. They believe spirits are simply semi-sen-
tient entities molded by the human will, much like a spell.
Renewed mages (Lab Coats or Noobs if you want to pick
a fight) frown upon "redundant New Age spirituality" and
especially "the nostalgic notion that ancient is better." The
absence of a moral and spiritual obligation leads many to con-
demn it as "degenerate."
· Ironic that the Lab Coats would be nowhere without the
Classicist theory.
· Mandrake
· Verifiable phenomena can't be denied, but that doesn't
imply one should take the first and best theory on it for granted.
A testable hypothesis is always a better approach than a con-
ceptual treatise dug up from an old book, simply because it
can be disproved.
· Shetani
. Well, most Renewed Hermetics privately hold a much more
esoteric view than they are willing to admit. It is a wee bit difficult
to live in a world of spirits without getting spiritual (pun intended).
· Reciprocity Rik
Renewed Hermetics take a very pragmatic approach,
attempting to apply magic to practical applications. This of
course makes them popular among corporations who are
happy to see sensible results from their investments. This is a
double-edged sword since this approach proves to be a strait-
jacket when it comes to intuitive and creative breakthroughs.
. The exception is cybermancy, but that's only used as "proof"
as to how ethically corrupt Renewed Hermeticism has
become.
. Doc Shock
· Wasn't cybermancy developed by Aztechnology? Azzie
bloodmages are a far cry from Renewed Hermetics.
. Miss Tick
Most Renewed Hermetics belong to corp-sponsored
study circles, though there are a few dedicated to "upholding
scientific standards." Most notable is the British Royal College
for Astral Studies and the Renewed Order of Hermes (who lent
their name to the paradigm).
Reformed Ritualism
Most Important Universities: Lyons (France), Stockholm
(Scand. Union), Jena (AGS)
Famous Study Circles: Dr. Faustus Society
Publications of Note: Concordata Ultima
Also known as the German school, Reformed Ritualism
builds upon early German attempts to recreate the medieval
and Renaissance Hermeticism. In some respects, it can be
seen as a bastard child of Classic and Renewed Hermeticism
with a focus on the cooperative ritual aspects of magic. The
emphasis in ritualist metatheory is that mana manipulation is
exponential in nature. Focusing multiple mages through ritu-
al magic and strict organization, the potency of both sorcery
and conjuring is enhanced. To Reformed Ritualists, member-
ship in groups, strict discipline and initiatory hierarchy are the
keys to magical advancement.
University classes among Reformed Ritualists are always
organized as ritual groups, though membership is not exclu-
sive and participation in other groups is actively encouraged.
The Dr. Faustus Society is a prime example of a Ritualist "study
circle," wielding considerable power in the German Alliance.
· The Corps Astralis Jenense is a Ritualist upstart rooted in the
Jena University campus. Originally focused on astral research, it
appears they have had a change of heart. It seems now they
want to contest the Faustians' influence on the German scene,
but their agenda remains unclear and the group comes off as
fairly immature and idealistic.

Minor players in the conflict, Vanguardists are our enfants
terribles, the counter-establishment alternative. To a
Vanguardist, the channeling of mana is an inherently personal
and creative act. Magic is an art form rather than a science, a
path of personal and creative development, and traditional
research is a useless straitjacket for the narrow-minded.
Vanguardist mages value creativity and individualism above
all else and the school isn't particularly successful in academ-
ic circles. Its freeform approach to magic development is seen
as unproductive, though it's infamous for unexpected
advances and breakthroughs that have stymied scholars of
other paradigms.
Though many are too individualistic to join any magical
group, there are a few "collectives" around. Formed in 2054,
the Vienna-based "Art! Art! Art!" was the first. Though a shock
to the otherwise conservative Austrians, they maintain a thriv-
ing presence on the Vienna campus. Their platform has inspired
many young magicians elsewhere, and a few corporations in
the media sector have started sponsoring them. What the corps
want, of course, is not the flashy style and individualism, but the
effusive creativity. Much like artists working in advertising, with
a little guidance, a Vanguardist can turn their creativity towards
results that actually pay off.

Unified Magic Theorists
Most Important Universities: Erfurt (AGS), Prague (Czech
Republic)
Famous Study Circles: None known
Publications of Note: Thaumaturgica Universalis, Thelluric
Quarterly
The universities of Prague and Erfurt, both being among
the largest in Europe when it comes to magical research, have
adopted a practical solution to the differences between com-
peting paradigms. Where other universities are plagued by the
power struggles of study circles and supporters of different
schools among the faculty, Charles and Erfurt universities have
given each paradigm their own playground. The magic depart-
ments are divided into different institutes, each focusing upon
research and education within a particular paradigm. This mea-
sure allowed for peaceful inter-paradigm discussion and cross-
pollination, which eventually led to the creation of the Unified
Magic Theory and its paradigm.
Though the youngest paradigm, it was the Unified Magic
Theorists who actually introduced the term paradigm to differ-
entiate the schools of magic. Rooted in years of discussion and
debate, the establishment of this paradigm came during
Prague's annual Universal Thaumaturgical Conference in 2060.
The conferences in subsequent years have been the main forum
for the promotion of the concept and it has spread quite quick-
ly. In 2060, there were only 50 delegates, mostly from Erfurt
and Prague. By 2063, there were nearly 500 from all over
Europe, the UCAS and Asia.
To be frank, I must admit I'm a supporter of UMT. I've
tried to be as unbiased as possible in the presentation of the
other paradigms, but it would be wrong to not state my opin-
ion here. As Unificationists, we believe all magic stems from
a single source, and as such, all variants of thaumaturgy
should be viewed simply as different routes to the same
truth. Instead of the competing paradigms model, Unified
Magic Theory defends they are all equally valid. From this
starting point, adherents to UMT try to develop a magical
style devoid of dogma and prejudice, which tries to learn
from all traditions. This way, we will be able to learn the most
about magic, and eventually develop a magical style that
combines the best from all.
· Nothing new here, chaos mages have been doing this for
years.
· Whiplash
. How many chaos mages do you know who actually con-
sider the theoretical implications of combining @abbalistic
symbols with Wiccan invocations in their formulas? How and
why do they retain their significance when the magician
doesn't subscribe to either bellef system? There's a lot more
here than meets the eye.
. Bookworm
. Unsurprisingly, UMT is absorbing the school known as Chaos
Magic. Mostly dominant in some American universities, it was
diminished in Europe until the conference in 2060. Unified
Magic Theory is what chaos magic becomes when it grows up.

could-they got magicians from different traditions and para-

· Magocrat
In the wake of the '61 Conference, Charles University start-
ed a program dedicated to researching non-hermetic tradi-
tions. While there were several nature magic curriculums in
effect earlier, this new program was directed at breaking down
the barriers between the different traditions. The theory states
the barriers are artificial constructs and that the traditions are
equally valid. As Arthur White Eagle himself put it at last year's
conference, they are "cultural blinders set on us by centuries of
mistrust and misunderstanding."

Outside of the Classic and Modern Schools, a few other
paradigms deserve special notice.

Concordance mages were the first to master the venerable
art of alchemy in the modern age. Though enchanting, artific-
ing and the creation of radicals are the common usages, an
entire hermetic paradigm has grown from the underlying the-
ory. Whereas hermeticism defines thaumaturgy as the chan-
neling of ambient mana through a mage's willpower and the
potency of symbols, Concordance Alchemists believe in a
greater "inner potential" locked in all things. Tapping this
"well-spring of mana" would increase the astral potency of sor-
cery and conjuring.
· Same logic as blood magic if you ask me. Tap into something
else's life force to power your magic.

Academically demanding, Concordance Alchemy draws
many of the brightest minds worldwide, but the complex
metaphysical framework prevents it from becoming popular.
Concordance mages invest heavily in magical research focused
mainly on materials, searching for the keys to their "secret fire."
They combine hermetic lore with modern science, quantum
theory, nanochemistry, particle theory and dimensional physics
into a complex and demanding paradigm.
The ultimate goal remains the "Philosopher's Stone," the
metaphorical key to everything's inner potential. By under-
standing the true nature of the world, the Alchemist hopes to
understand himself and metahumanity, becoming a true
philosopher and achieving true enlightenment.
. Their quest for this "inner fire" produces numerous byproducts
that the corps just lap up. Some stuff has frightening potential.
Other stuff is too esoteric to ever be of use. MysTech Labs up in
Boston is one of the few Concordance think tanks. They've
caught on to the fact that their byproducts are the next man's
SOTA developments and make a killing licensing their inciden-
tal creations. Last I heard, it was thaumo-sensitive paint addi-
tives and some sort of astrally-sensitive film.

don't help the bottom line. The few corps sponsoring Alchemist

Pythagoreans
Most Important Universities: Madrid (Spain), MIT&T (UCAS),
Atlanta (CAS)
Famous Study Circles: Circle Descartes, Pentateuch group
Publications of Note: Mechanica Celestial
To the Pythagoreans, math is the language of the uni-
verse, and thus language of magic. Though they have revived
the math-mysticism of the ancient followers of Pythagoras,
modern Pythagoreans have also adopted the full range of
mathematical theory developed since. A modern computer is
an essential crutch.
Pythagoreans are aptly nicknamed Mathmagicians as their
spell formulas appear to be nothing more than an algorithm or
a geometrical expression. As a nod to the more esoteric views
of ancient Pythagoreans, they incorporate the harmonics of
spheres (the metaplanes), it as a number of profound mystical
significance and the dodecahedron (a twelve-sided polygon)
as having magical properties. The Pythagoreans believe they
now have the tools to fulfill the quest Pythagoras began, and
reach a full understanding of the world through mathematics.
The "Omega Equation" is the Pythagorean version of the
Philosopher's Stone, the key to the greater truths.
The Pythagoreans are a small group, but their ideas have
had an impact upon the Renewed Hermetics. The mathemati-
cal approach has an appeal to those who believe magic should
be a hard science.
· Reading a Pythagorean spellbook is impossible if you don't
have a university degree in advanced math. Can't see what
they need all those numbers and formulas for when they don't
do anything more than a witch with a kitchen knife.

MAGIC & CHRISTIANITY
Christianity remains an omnipresent reminder of
Europe's past. The Protestant work ethic is still socially per-
vasive, the Orthodox patriarchs played a decisive role in get-
ting Eastern Europe back on track after the Euro Wars, and
millions world wide still hang on the words of Pope John XXV,
even though Catholicism is secretly divided between conser-
vatives and reformists.
Though the myth of the "Burning Times" during the
Inquisition has been largely dispelled, there is no denying the
practitioners of witchcraft, hedge magic and Qabbalah were
indeed persecuted by the church. This prejudice was still glar-
ingly obvious when Pope John Paul IV denounced the harbin-
gers of the Awakening-magic and metahumans-as unholy
and demonic. I won't get into the fallout (you can find that in

the Shadows of Europe folio, if you're interested), but it's cru-
cial to understand that even the Vatican was forced to do an
about face with the landmark Imago Dei encyclical. Several
other denominations followed suit.
Aside from declaring magic as neither good nor evil and
spirits as the elemental forces of God's creation, Imago Dei sig-
nificantly established that magic is not divine intervention and
hence not a miracle.
. Of course it took ten years for John XXV to bring the church
around and the conservatives are still going strong today.
Higher-ups in the Spanish and Italian clergy just pay lip service
to Imago Dei and the pope's agenda.
· Padre Pedro
· Imago Dei also reversed church doctrine regarding metahu-
mans, something the German Catholics did not take lightly.
When it was first introduced in 2014, they broke with Rome. They
do make exceptions for magic; as long as the magicians are
members of the clergy and only practice theurgy.
· Cain
So what does this mean to magicians who practice
Christianity? Faith and belief are major factors in the way magi-
cians perform and perceive magic. To the European Christian
leaders, magic is a powerful force created by God and bestowed
upon mankind, just like any other force of nature. As great
power corrupts, however, magic is carefully regulated and con-
trolled. Hence the creation of theurgy, a variant of hermeticism
purged of pagan references and infused with Christian symbol-
ism. The churches only enforce this tradition and its teachings
among clergy; believers are free to follow or disregard the
guidelines set down by each church, at their own peril, of course.
. That last bit is important. The church doesn't say there's any-
thing inherently wrong with other paradigms, but requires its
own clerical magicians use theurgy. Your average street mage
can be a good Christian, but if he decides to devote himself to
a religious vocation, he's got to learn theurgy.
· Magister
Miracles are believed to be beyond Awakened man. It is
divine intervention and reserved for saints. Christianity toes a
fine line regarding the shamanistic path since this belief stig-
matizes shamans who believe their power comes directly from
God. In Catholic congregations, such shamans are often reject-
ed for presumption-if not outright sacrilege. Reformist
Protestant Churches like the Anglicans (UK), Lutherans
(Northern Europe) and the Orthodox Church in Eastern Europe,
on the other hand, have a liberal policy regarding magic use,
not attributing any significant theological or metaphysical con-
notation to the gift. The issue of conjuring and spirits does raise
some issues, but nothing substantial. No matter how fuzzy the
distinction between magic and miracle might be in the Sixth
World, most of the Christian churches agree it exists.

CATHOLIC ORDER OF ST. SYLVESTER
Though Catholic conservatives opposed the move, the
pope changed church doctrine and allowed Catholics to use
magic under the tenets of the Imago Dei Encyclical. Most
notable amongst these magic users is the Order of St.
Sylvester, devoted to using magic for good and to protect
humanity from evil magic and Awakened threats. The order
consists of magically active priests and friars. These magical
guardians are also the church's primary exorcists, battling
everything from insect spirits to shedim.
. Unfortunately, the Sylvestrines have been infiltrated by the New
Knights Templar. Many of the methods of the NKT are in direct vio-
lation of the beliefs of the order. so trouble is definitely brewing.
· Roland
. Sylvestrines also host schools that teach magic to those who
can't afford formal educations. The most famous of these is in
what used to be Turin, Italy,
· Linate
. The Sylvestrines are more tolerant of shamanism than the rest
of the Catholics. In Tir na nÓg, they've even gotten chummy
with the Celtic druids.
· Lorelei
WESTPHALIAN THEURGISTS
During the early years of the Schism, some groups within
the church resisted the new pope's pro-magical and pro-
metahuman doctrines. Foremost amongst these was the
Westphalian (AGS) clergy. When these ultra-conservative
Catholics saw the reversal of doctrine was inevitable, they
broke with Rome, expelled many metahumans from their new
theological state and banned the use of magic among the
nation's population.
They did make an exception, however, for "clerical white
magic"-or theurgy-as practiced by the German Catholic
Church. They reasoned that the gift "comes from God" and if
properly controlled and regulated by those "appropriately
trained" and "pure of spirit" then it could become a force for
good. This hypocritical reasoning has served them well, and a
strong recruitment program has given gifted youths a choice:
if you wish to develop your talent, join the clergy or leave the
country. Despite its small size, the Holy Church of God and his
Saints of Westphalia numbers almost as many magicians as the
Catholic Church does in Europe.
ORTHODOX EXARCHS
The Greek Orthodox Church was one of the first to come
to terms with the true extent of the Awakening. Almost
overnight, Greece became a magical hotspot. Rather than seek
conflict, the Orthodox patriarchs sought to understand and
adapt to the new realities, something facilitated by the tradi-
tional Orthodox openness to mysticism.
Realizing the dangers of the Awakening were very real,
the Orthodox clergy collected its magical resources in small
groups under the command of regional patriarchs. These
"Exarchs" would fight fire with fire, and like the Sylvestrines,
they would target the evil abuse of magic. While they keep a
much lower profile than their Catholic counterparts, the
Exarchs proved decisive in holding the line in several Eastern
European countries against the bug outbreaks in 2056.
. The main training ground for the Exarchs is the dozens of
monasteries around Mt. Athos in Greece. The monasteries are
also famous for preserving a number of texts and treasures dat-
ing back to Roman and Hellenic times, and though they've
been sacked numerous times, the Orthodox Church has always
seen fit to rebuild them. Makes you wonder if the Vatican is the
only one keeping secrets.
· Papadiamantis
. The Orthodox Church is less homogenous than the Catholic
Church and is divided into several different factions. Normally,
the Greek Orthodox are at odds with the Russian and Ukranian
churches over who boasts more influence, but with the latter
two focusing their attention on the developing events in Russia,
the Greek Patriarch has made a push to bring several smaller
patriarchies in the Balkans and Eastern Europe under his control.

GAME INFORMATION
The new rules and background information on European
magic traditions build on material previously presented in the
Shadowrun Third Edition rulebook and the Magic in the
Shadows (MITS) sourcebook. Both books are necessary to use
many of the new rules. Additional material, including both set-
ting information and a number of advanced options and rules
can be found in Target: Awakened Lands, Target: Wastelands
and State of the Art 2063.
NEO-PAGAN MAGIC
The magical systems of most neo-pagans abide by the
rules for idol followers and shamans (p.16, MITS). The accom-
panying chart may also prove useful as a basic guideline for
associating gods and idols. A few exceptions, such as hermet-
ic-oriented Wiccans, use the standard rules for hermetic magic.
In the Sixth World, neo-paganism has much wider acceptance
and appeal making it a more numerous and mainstream faith.
Many magicians are affiliated with neo-pagan magical groups
or at least wider neo-pagan movements, of which those men-
tioned in the fiction are only a brief sample. Gamemasters are
encouraged to expand upon these and develop their own.
Gods, Idols, Totems and Other Complications
As noted in the fiction, many European pagan magicians
follow a pantheistic belief system that entails a mystic frame-
work for magic and devotion to a particular deity or pantheon.
While the rules for this are presented in Magic in the Shadows,
an additional note should be made regarding the roleplaying
aspects of this belief. The connection between the game con-
cept "idol" and the character's belief in a god isn't always as
straight-forward as one might suppose.

An idol represents a set of mystic, symbolic and intellec-
tual ideals that have spiritual significance to the idol follower
and thus, in game terms, focus his magic much as a totem
would. For the neo-pagan character, this is often seen as direct
empowerment by his god. Since idols are archetypical ideals.
several gods within the same pantheon might be represented
by the same idol, and a particular god (ie. Odin/Wotan) might
be worshiped through several different aspects/idols (ie.
Bacchus, Dark King, Horned Man, Sky Father, Wild Huntsman
and Wise Warrior all fit Odin/Wotan mythology).
Gamemasters should make it clear to the players that "idol
follower" is a game term, one which represents a particular
aspect of a god or goddess. This means that two gode of the
Cult of Odin might have different modifiers to their magic in
game terms, but roleplay the identical set of basic religious
beliefs and rites.
Many European neo-pagans view
an entire pantheon as equally impor-
tant. The pantheistic pagan magician
follows the standard rules for panthe-
istic shamans (p.16, MITS), though he
associates the varying advantages or
disadvantages granted every lunar
cycle with the dominant deity of that
celestial period.
Festivals
Neo-pagans associate special mys-
tical significance to certain days of the
year when the spirit world is closest to
Earth and the ebbs and tides of magic
are at their highest. Several different
faiths share the celebration of
Midsummer's
and
Midwinter's
Solstices and the Spring and Fall
Equinoxes. The background count at
sacred sites and on ley lines during
these symbolic sacred dates is also
subject to fluctuations.
At the gamemaster's discretion,
the Background Count in question
(either generated by the festival/blot
itself or by mana fluctations) may help
in initiation rituals. A Background
Count of 2 or more decreases the cost
of initiation by 1 Karma point. This only
applies when the initiate is actively
participating in the rituals and belongs
to a magical system which places sig-
nificance on those dates.
Urban Witches (Optional Rule)
In the metaphysics of European
witchcraft, spirits of the sky don't pos-
sess any true spiritual connection with
cities and sprawls. Therefore, urban
shamans (p. 16, MITS), conjure ances-
tor spirits (p. 106, MITS) in addition to
spirits of man, instead of spirits of the sky. Otherwise they fol-
low standard rules for urban shamans and totems.
WICCA
Wicca is a modern nature-revering pagan religion that
melds reconstructed pagan lore with modern spiritualism and
hermetic ceremonial magic. Wicca comes in many variants
ranging from animists who follow nature totems (and rules for
wilderness shamans) to quasi-hermetic mages. Some Wiccans
follow the rules for mages, some for shamans. This varies from
witch to witch, even within the same coven, as Wicca allows
many individual interpretations and revelations. For further
guidelines on Wicca and its trappings, refer to p. 26, MITS.
Most large Wicca groups combine both hermetic and
shamanic magicians, but some focus on hermetic magic (best

represented by Gardnerian Wiccans) and the Goddess cults
often focus on shamanic (idol followers of Great Mother,
Moon Maiden). Some Wiccans invoke other gods in their
rituals, but treat these as facets of the god and goddess. A
minority (such as Celtic Wiccans) are truly shamanic and fol-
low nature, animal and mythical totems.
As befits a tradition that melds many different beliefs and
mythological frameworks, Wicca has traces of both shamanic
and hermetic practices in many fundamental aspects. One
shamanic aspect is the use of sacred groves, circles, shrines,
glades, temples and other appropriate natural locations as rit-
ual sites. These function as regular shamanic lodges during rit-
uals, but are normally inert unless the area is a power site or
boasts a particular background count. Some Wicca ritual sites
may also have permanent hermetic circles too, though each
has to be created separately following standard rules. As part
of their hermetic heritage, most Wicca covens and circles
adopt the use of a grand grimoire-the Book of Shadows-
that doubles as a library for hermetic Wiccans (max. Rating 6),
acts as a material link to all group members and as a focus for
the group's avatar to manifest.
Typical magical gear for Wiccans includes the athame
(a dagger used for rituals, and quite often as a focus),
chalice, sword, wands, pentacle, cauldron and broom.
Rituals include singing and dancing, sometimes per-
formed "skyclad" (nude) and usually answering to the
cycles of the moon.
Rumors persist of secret Wicca and druidic metamagic
that allow them to channel the power of the moon and to
conjure strange spirits such as the Wild Hunt and the
Morrigan. Their existence and specific abilities are left to the
gamemaster. If based on fact, these techniques should be
beyond the knowledge of anyone but a select few high-
level initiates, and certainly beyond non-devoted shad-
owrunners. These forces would possess the power level of
a totem or an avatar.
Other rumors of Wicca sacrifices and use of blood magic
probably result from a misunderstanding of Wicca's ritual
respect for nature, whereby nothing can be taken from
nature without giving something back (but who knows).

WITCHES
Whereas most other magical traditions were re-invented
after the Awakening, traditional witches haven't changed
much. While it's not common for witches and shadowrunners
to cross paths, it does happen, often with interesting results.
Traditional witches follow the general rules for shamans
with a few idiosyncrasies that establish them as a unique tra-
dition. Such witches have no totems or idols and as such gain
no bonuses or disadvantages. Witches conjure nature spirits as
shamans, though they may elect to invoke ancestor spirits
rather than spirits of man. Individuals may also be considered
urban shamans (p. 16, MITS), even though they might not live
in a city, but rather in rural villages and townships.
The unassuming style of magic used by a traditional witch
has peculiar advantages and limitations. The main drawback is
that traditional witches cannot use sorcery as other mages or
shamans; instead they are limited to ritual sorcery and a vari-
ant of anchored spells. Followers of this tradition possess
knowledge of anchoring metamagic (p. 70, MITS) from the out-
set, at the expense of non-ritual sorcery. Hexes are simply nor-
mal spells cast on potions, fetishes, trinkets or gear-such
items must be handcrafted using the rules for anchoring.
Potions and jewelry are the most common items a witch will
hex (see the anchoring examples on p. 71, MITS) and common
trigger conditions include ingesting, crushing underfoot and
breaking after being thrown.
Most witches are full magicians, even though they are sub-
ject to the limitations of their tradition. Aspected witches may be
sorcerers or conjurers per standard rules, or they may choose to
be aspected healers or aspected diviners. Aspected healers may
cast healing spells (as normal) and conjure spirits of man (or
alternatively ancestor spirits) and otherwise follow standard rules
for aspected magicians. Aspected diviners are more limited, as
they can't use sorcery or conjuring, but possess divination meta-
magic without requiring initiation. While this is a rare magical
expression, expert diviners can be very dangerous foes and use-
ful friends. Several other magic groups also boast aspected divin-
ers, such as the Seers' Guild and the Oracle of Delphos.
Charms
Only witches can create the simple enchantments called
charms, or luck charms. An Enchanting (6) Test (no formula
needed) is required to charm an appropriate item (which must
be hand-crafted). If successful, the enchanter can then invest 1
point of Good Karma into the item. Charms must be freely
given by the witch and the recipient is considered to have
bonded it. This has no cost.
From then on, the owner (Awakened or mundane), may
tap the invested Karma in the charmed item by touching it
(with a Simple Action) exclusively for the purpose of re-rolling
a test. Charms are one-shot foci. The charmed item's aura
burns out rendering it inert, making it unable to hold future

charms or to be used as foci. Charms are individual and per-

to an individual (whether on his person or not) also "empty"
and burn out without effect when one is used. For all other pur-
poses (such as Focus Addiction or Astral Combat), treat charms
as a Force 1 focus.

ally to warn him. The only person she can turn to is an old run-

DRUIDS
Celtic and wild druids are the inheritors of an ancient cul-
ture of natural philosophy and elemental nature magic. The
vast majority of Celtic druids and all wild druids are varieties of
wilderness shamans. While wild druids follow both nature and
animal totems appropriate to their local culture (such as Sun,
Moon, Oak, Stream, Wildcat, Bear, Eagle, Wolf and Wyrm),
Celtic druids follow idols (see the pagan gods and idols table
on p. 123 for various possibilities) as well as nature totems rep-
resenting the divinities, elemental forces and sacred animals of
the Celtic pantheon. General guidelines on druidic magic can
be found on p. 25, MITS, and the following should be consid-
ered optional expanded rules.
Druids are naturally adept at the metamagic technique of
sensing (p. 110, T:AL) and it is often one of the first techniques
they pick at initiation. To reflect their natural aptitude, druids
get +1 die to any Sensing Test. This awareness of ambient

druid) also allows them greater ease in gathering talismonger
materials in the vicinity of their sacred circles. Many druids are
also expert herbalists, allowing them to use Herb Lore as a
Complementary skill on all Enchanting Tests involving appro-
priate materials. All herbal materials must be gathered with the
consecrated golden sickle carried by all druids.
As long as they are within their sacred circle, druids also
have the ability to summon appropriate great form spirits of
the appropriate domain, even if they do not possess invok-
ing metamagic.
Like many neo-pagans, druids celebrate four major annual
festivals of immense ritual significance: Imbolc, Beltane,
Lugnasad and Samhain. Druids often reserve great ritual work-
ings for these festivals (for example, the unleashing of the Wild
Ley during the Summer Solstice of 2064), and always reserve
initiation rituals and ordeals for those sacred occasions.
Bards
Some followers of druidism, magicians and adepts
alike, see themselves as heirs to the bardic tradition of Celtic
lore rather than the priestly one. They focus on the bardic
virtues of lorekeeping, storytelling and performance
associated with traditional Celtic culture, even if they
resort to modern mediums to do so. From Celtic rockers
to traditional troubadours, bards are found among most
European druidic cultures. The most famous are the
Cornish bards in Britain and the Breton troubadours in
France. It is not uncommon for such bards and minstrels
to form magical groups under the guise of traveling
musical or theatre troupes.
In game terms, bards are mainly Celtic-inspired
magicians with artistic skills and artist's way adepts,
though their troupes and companies normally include
mundane musicians, actors and stagehands.
Many of these bards are quite political in their out-
look and are connected to various policlubs and move-
ments with social and ecological agendas, using their
skills and powers to promote those causes. In England,
for instance, some of the best-selling bands of the
moment are bards associated with the anti-establishment
movement. In Brittany, major festivals during Beltane and
Samhain draw many thousands of tourists to see the
annual contests between the bards and bands on show.

desecration.
NORSE PAGANS
Norse pagan magicians follow the rules for shamans.
They either devote themselves to the Norse pantheon as a
whole (per the rules for pantheistic shamans) or to one god
(becoming idol followers of a given aspect of the divinity).
Popular sects include the Cults of Odin, Thor, Freya and the
Vanir. In most Asatru cults, the Awakened fulfill the roles of
priests and advisors. Among the warrior cults, however, the
clerics are at least as bloodthirsty as the rank and file and
lead by example. For further guidelines on Norse magic,
refer to p. 26, MITS.
Rune Enchanting
Rune magic applies conditional restrictions (similar to
geasa) to foci. Rune enchanting requires more than simply
carving Futhark runes into your foci. To use the technique,
one must possess the Rune Lore Knowledge skill in addition
126

Page 119:

NOVATECH
to the standard Enchanting skill. This skill teaches the prop-
er way to weave the enchantment, the meaning and function
of each rune and how to combine them properly (since the
meaning of the runes and function changes when placed in
different configurations).
A player who wishes to use rune enchanting must say so
before starting on a focus formula (p. 42, MITS), as the runic
restriction must be incorporated in the formula. Using runic
restrictions doubles the base time for creating the formula.
After the normal Enchanting Test, the player must succeed in
a Rune Lore Test against the Force of the focus. If the test
fails, it counts as if the Enchanting Test had failed. Enchanters
without Rune Lore cannot use runic restrictions in a focus for-
mula. The base time for the Enchanting Test is also doubled.
Runic restrictions are treated as geasa (p. 31-33, MITS)
except the foci only functions if the restrictions are met.
Typical restrictions are: "cannot be exposed to sunlight;"
"must be soaked in beer;" "cannot touch steel;" and "must
be exposed to moonlight." At the gamemaster's discretion,
very specific geasa-"can only be used under a full moon"
for instance-may count as two geasa. Each restriction
decreases the Enchanting Test target number and both the
first and standard bonding Karma cost by one. Runic foci
count towards foci addiction normally and may even be
taken as a condition of a normal talisman geasa.
Runes may be (and are) used in enchanting without
applying runic restrictions, but in these cases they offer no
bonus effects.
Berserkers
Berserkers (originally bearsarks or bear-skinned) are war-
riors who boast magical abilities when they enter a combat
frenzy (go "berserk"). Most are warrior adepts with a combat
frenzy geasa applied to all their magical powers, though
some are also magician's way adepts. Berserkers may also
be shamanic way adepts as they usually bear the skin of a
wild (and fearsome) animal who is their spirit guide. Some
powerful berserkers have been known to display a shamanic
mask effect when in a combat frenzy. All berserkers may go
berserk in the same way as Bear shamans do (p. 163, SR3).
Certain drugs, BTLs and alcoholic beverages may also be
used to induce combat frenzies. Awakened drugs that have
additional effects are especially popular among berserkers.
Initiated berserkers may go berserk at will through a
Willpower (6 - Initiate Grade) Test.
HERMETIC PARADIGMS AND SCHOOLS
Paradigms and the various schools of hermetic lore are
designed to introduce more variety to those interested in role-
playing mages beyond the traditional "general practitioner"
and provide more depth and color to the rather uniform her-
metic path. They also provide interesting and unique plot
hooks, particularly for a gamemaster running magic-focused
campaigns. Finally, they also serve to underline that even the
hermetic view of magic is not monolithic but that the nature of
magic remains elusive and mysterious.
In game terms, paradigms follow the rules for hermetic
schools on p. 17, MITS. Gamemasters may wish to increase the
positive and negative modifiers to +2 or -2 when using her-
metic circles and libraries of other schools for particularly dis-
tinct or opposite schools (such as a Vanguardist using a
Hermetic Druid circle). Another option is to extend such neg-
ative modifiers to the use of foci, spell formulas and ritual trap-
pings of particularly different schools (such as a Hermetic Druid
trying to use a Pythagorean's formula).
Finally, gamemasters may also wish to expand on how
these different paradigms affect the local foci and talismonger-
ing markets by increasing prices (+20%) and availabilities (+50%)
of ritual materials and foci for followers of schools which have a
limited local presence. Note that most academically trained
mages in North America follow the Renewed Hermeticism par-
adigm, though Unified Magic Theory is gaining popularity at
MIT&T. Several schools may boast these additional modifiers:
Hermetic Druidism: Benefit from the same advantages as
Celtic and wild druids at sacred circles and during the four
major festival dates; otherwise treat as standard hermetics.
Reformed Ritualism: Ritualists receive +1 die for all ritual
magic Sorcery Tests, but a -1 die for all other Spellcasting.
Avant-Garde Thaumaturgy: The empiric Vanguardists
have a flare for developing new spells and get +2 dice for Spell
Design Tests when creating an entirely new formula (though
not for a variant of a published spell). Their individualistic
approach means they do not work well in groups and suffer a
-1 die modifier to all group ritual magic Sorcery Tests.
Unified Magic Theory: Groundbreaking techniques allow
advanced UMT initiates (Grade 3 or higher) to change their
Conjuring orientation from elementals to nature spirits (or back),
instead of acquiring a new metamagic technique at initiation.
The mage doing this, however, is then unable to conjure the
type of spirits he previously did. UMTs do not suffer penalties
for using the tools and trappings of other schools or traditions
(including shamans, houngan and wujen), but do not get any
positive modifiers for using their own tools and trappings either.
Concordance Alchemists: Alchemists gain +2 dice for
Enchanting Tests, but to understand anything of alchemical the-
ory (and thus be an alchemist) one needs to have both Chemistry
and Physics Knowledge skills at a minimum rating of 3.
Pythagoreans: Only trained Pythagoreans or mages with a
Math Knowledge skill of 4 or greater may use or interpret
Pythagorean spell formulas and magic circles.

T
he entertainment, culture and leisure section I put together for last year's State of the

shadowrunners aren't always taking place in corporate boardrooms or top-secret labs;
quite often they're happening right in front of us, on the street or on the trid. I've sam-

ORXPLOITATION
by the KA-POW! KA-POW! team
Hoi shadowteens! Welcome to a special edition of KA-POW! KA-POW! Strap on your
seatbelt and get ready, we are bringing you a jam-packed report about the latest and
greatest revolution that's hitting the 'plex!
POWER TO THE PEOPLE, CHUMMER
They used to be the ugly ducklings of music, but not anymore. You won't see any of
them wearing Vashon Island suits or dishing out la-di-dah rhymes in Sperethiel (yawn) ...
but they have tusks, guitars and attitude-lots of it! Goblin rockers are ruling the music
world, with "orxploitation" as their banner.
Sure, you might have heard the term on RockNet and countless other trid channels in
the 'plex, but what is orxploitation? To answer that, we need to go waaay back in history ...
2057 to be precise, right after President Dunkelzahn was killed and his will unveiled. Amid
all the riches and relics doled out to the famous and infamous, nobody seemed to notice
two nobodies who claimed two obscure but important inheritances.
e "Waaay back?" But that's only six years ago!

e Socio Pat
To Robert Page, I leave my copy of an ancient text that
proves elves are not the only race to possess a unique lan-
guage. Take pride in your heritage and continue to promote
the rights of your people, for the orks have always fought to
rise above the position in which others would keep them.
May this document aid your struggle up from below.
To Maureen Williams, I leave the trust fund at Silicon
Valley Virtual Bank, account 0456 967 0145 8620, for the
purpose of establishing a free school in Orkland.
You're probably wondering what these two people have
to do with music, right? Pretty much nothing: the first one
was a respected civil rights activist in San Francisco, while
the later was a UCLA faculty member.
. God, I love politically correct media. Page belonged to the
October 25 Alliance, the metahuman group trying to turn
Tokyo-by-the-Bay into good ol' San Francisco once again.
Williams had a lackluster career until Dunkelzahn showered
her with nuyen. Seems the wyrm knew how to inspire her.
· People Watcher
So here was Ms. Williams, with a chunk of Dunkie's
money and a mission. Faster than you could say "goodbye
City of Angels," she jumped out of LA and into San Fran,
waving her almighty Wand of Nuyen to create the Orkland
Community Center (OCC).
· That almost sounds as fantastic as this news actually was.
The Japanacorps that ran the Bay Area were dead opposed
to the project, convinced (correctly) that the OCC would
become a spawning ground for the pro-meta resistance. But
Williams either had enough money to make some serious
bribes and/or she received approval with the help of some
(gasp!) illegal activities. Either way, the OCC was founded.
· Bay Jewel
. That's the story, but not everyone's buying it. Some people
think that the Japanacorps only approved it after Maureen
made some secret agreements-most likely aiding them to
spy on dissidents there. Once it was running, Williams worked
hard to keep the radicals from organizing there too much,
saying that she wanted the focus to be on improving the ork
community rather than fighting the Japanese. Some of us still
think she may have been selling us out-when Saito took
over, some top October 25 Alliance people who were
involved with the OCC disappeared.
· Partisan
. Bulldrek. There's no doubt the Japanese were spying on the
OCC, but Williams wasn't working with them. If she was real-
ly so anti-radical, then why did she allow the MPA to keep a
stash of Kalashnikovs hidden in the basement?
Chompsky
First on her hiring list was Page, who had the sole task
of translating the Rosetta-like book the dragon had left him.
· What's a Rosetta?
· Curious George
. The original "Rosetta Stone" was a stone tablet with the
same text in three different languages: Demotic, Greek and
ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. It was a breakthrough for
archeologists as it allowed them to decipher hieroglyphics for
the first time. In Page's case, Dunkelzahn left him a huge tome
with metallic pages containing the same text in Sperethiel
and an unidentified language presumed to be an ork tongue.
· Champollion
. | could give a frag about ancient languages, real or not.
How much is it worth?
· 9-Finger Steve
o If it's for real, as it seemingly is, then it's priceless. I heard
that Page refused an eight-digit offer from a private collec-
tor, who then sent a team to "convince" him. Only one came
back from Orkland to tell his boss the answer was still "no."
· Aegis
With a team of Sperethiel translators and linguistic experts
provided by the Draco Foundation, Page was able to analyze
and decode the text, publishing his initial findings in 2060. The
Or'zet Codex, as he called it, established the basics of an ork
language and spread through academic and social networks.
. Draco's help didn't come cheap: Page and Williams had
to give them privileged access to certain parts of the book.
Yes, I'd also give my right cyberarm to know what's in those
pages.
· Lexicon
I can't believe you all are buying into this drek. There is no
"ancient ork language." What nonsense! This is nothing more
than a scam perpetrated by Page and his Draco accomplices,
a manufactured language like Esperanto or Klingon. It's a shal-
low attempt to give orks some sort of mythic lineage and racial
pride, just like the elven snobs have pulled in Tir Tairngire. Next
thing you know they'll be telling us that "ancient ork warriors"
used to ride dinosaurs into battle. And then we'll hear how
humans have always been keeping the orks down, treating 'em
like second-class citizens. Bull. Fraggin. Drek.

· Orange Queen
The OCC started teaching Or'zet in
2061, but its efforts came to a halt when
General Saito crashed the party in San
Francisco. The Codex project was pub-
licly condemned by Saito's regime as a
scam, and staff working on the Or'zet
project were jailed for "conspiracy to
commit fraud" and intentionally deceiv-
ing investors and public officials. All
work related to the project was confis-
cated and publicly destroyed.
. More accurately, Saito's goons round-
ed up all the researchers who hadn't
gone underground yet and jailed them
for "disseminating enemy propaganda."
They even held an old-fashioned book
burning (well, chip and e-paper burning)
where they destroyed all the work they
had seized.

hearing stories about him sharing a drink with Elvis in Las
Vegas, or relaxing in the starship with Juan Atzcapotzalco.
· Groucho Marxist
The Protectorate's crackdown, however, came just a lit-
tle too late. Page and friends had already programmed the
first linguasoftware for Or'zet, and they released this and
other Or'zet-related material online, where it quickly circu-
lated through various underground Matrix nodes. Within a
few months, MetaErgonomics released the first Or'zet lin-
guasoft chip through its worldwide distribution channels.
Though incomplete and condemned by many pundits and
even some scientists as a fabricated language, Or'zet was an
instant hit among young orks!
. And almost immediately they began garbling it with their
own unique interpretations and slang.
· Tuskadero
TONEDEAF UJNORT
Though ork rights activists were quick to pick up on
Or'zet, goblin rockers beat them to the punch. Almost
overnight, Or'zet began to pop up in songs, mixing politi-
cally charged lyrics with a strong sense of pride. These songs
were instant hits among the ork youth fan base who were
excited to see Or'zet used in media. The ork musicians using
or'zet had a clear political message about the discrimination
orks face on a daily basis, and their cause celebre was the
clampdown on Or'zet's birthplace: Orkland, California.
"We had to do something," say the members of Riot
Squad, "this breeder in California doesn't just want to lock us
in ghettos, he's out to exterminate us, plain and simple. To me,
the crackdown on Or'zet is just the beginning of a cultural
genocide. We have to stand up for ourselves, because the suits
in Washington are too comfy in their seats to do anything."
Tough words from the kings of alternative music, indeed!
· Cultural genocide? Orks have no culture of their own, no
matter how hard they pretend to. They're as ethnically divid-
ed as humans are. Next thing you know, though, the corps
will be selling us "ancient ork secrets" in the guise of laundry
detergent, hot sauce and booze.
. Hood
It wasn't long before the entertainment industry smelled
a potential new market. Early this year, well known ork artist
CrimeTime shocked his fan by scrapping his Eurotour and
releasing Djoto, the very first album to be mostly in Or'zet.
Djoto combined the mandatory political message and
CrimeTime's trademark carefree outcast attitude.
. Don't even buy for a nanosecond all that PR drek about
CrimeTime weeping for his poor CalFree cerri. The album is
just a carefully designed commercial record aimed at the ork
market. Besides, the language isn't even pure-there's plen-
ty of bastardized cityspeak jargon filling in the blanks
· Character Assassin
Pay attention, shadowteens, because here comes the
funny. You see, CrimeTime's latest and most infamous
squeeze is none other than Tiffany Brackhaven. Now, little
Tiffany happens to be the rebellious granddaughter of Karl
Brackhaven, leader of the Humanis Policlub. Needless to say,
Grandpa Karl has become something of a laughingstock in
the late night shows.
. Then why didn't he ice the trog? All it takes is an overdose.
· Warthog

When CrimeTime released his new album, Brackhaven
made his move through Humanis' media hound, the Legion
of UCAS Decency (we here at KA-POW! KA-POW! love to
hate the LOUD, their 2057 lawsuit still fresh in our minds).
The LOUD launched a vicious smear campaign against the
ork artist. The plan seemed foolproof ...
· Pinky, are you pondering what I'm pondering?
· Bung
... And it was a spectacular failure. The attempt to ruin
CrimeTime's career left him with a reputation as a polemic,
charismatic street mobster. Almost overnight, Djoto became

Suddenly, the music industry realized it had found a gold
mine and rushed to profit from it. In no time, tusker rock
entered mainstream culture, thanks to novahot stars like sen-
suous Orxanne, no-nonsense Tusk Master, party boy MC
Bacchus and the perennial troll heavies, Darwin's Bastards.
. The market's flooded with cheap clones and crappy songs,
and there's more every day. The gullible masses buy every-
thing the corps throw at them. Just look at this year's charts:
Deirdre is the lone non-ork or troll act in the Top 10, and only
because of her rumored affair with Aztechnology's Domingo
Ramos boosted her sales.
· Teddy X
. The Ork Boom has been so huge and fast that the music
labels are hiring anyone who can sing in Or'zet. Drek, rumor

example of humans abusing us for their own gain," he blasted.
"The music industry doesn't think about our plight, only its bot-
tom line. And the club kid ork posers are even worse. They see
us like a toy: funny to play with, but something you can put
away at the end of the day.
"I've heard some concerns about the image we're giving of
our people" countered Hez Music's President Joe Radek, "but the
truth is that money isn't the only thing flowing into the communi-
ty. Take a walk through the poorest ork neighborhoods and you'll
see that our artists have given them a renewed sense of pride."
· Pride doesn't help when you're starving to death.

e Wait a sec-Joe Radek? That name sounds familiar, give

· X-Star
Others, like Kate Grant, were cautious, though they wel-
comed the new interest in orks. "We at Mothers of
Metahumans have always struggled to improve our chil-
dren's situation. I think it's too early to predict the political
fallout, but give or take a few years we might be seeing a
change. There's potential in this movement, but also risks."
0 | think one measurement of this fad's life expectancy is looking
at how many people are actually learning Or'zet, versus just slot-
ting it on chip. Sadly, most folks are taking the instant gratification
route, which is also the path of least longevity.
. No Chummer Left Behind
Change might be slow in politics, but it's already hap-
pening in the entertainment industry. Amalgamated Studios
has confirmed that the next Neil the Ork Barbarian flick will
feature none other than CrimeTime. Knowing our Man of the
Year's style, we just can't wait for it! Stay tuned, shadowteens!
. Amalgamated has built a huge set in Pueblo, with thou-
sands of extras as horse-riders or something like that. The
Atlantean Foundation is helping with the historical realism. It's
going to be one of the most profitable movies ever-or the

Bill.
I know you're busy with that serial killer you mentioned
last week, but we're having serious problems with the music
industry here. I wish our only worries were the fights
between goblin rock fans and the racist fringe, or the
Humanis and LOUD pickets outside concerts turning uglier
than usual. Truth is, we'd been expecting violence from day
one, we just didn't think it would be this bad.
The rivalries between ork and non-ork artists are spiral-
ing out of control, frequently ending up in violence. What's
worse, many musicians have gang connections and they're
calling in for reinforcements. Last week was a perfect exam-
ple of what could be on the way. After days of petty bicker-
ing in the media and nightclubs, Tusk Master's buddies at the
Rusted Stilettos almost killed the drummer of Darwin's
Bastards in a firefight. Two days later, the Spikes leveled Tusk
Master's favorite hangout. Net result? 11 dead, 42 injured.
We've talked with the rockers' managers to no avail-
they don't give a frag about the situation. In fact, we're
investigating an executive from Mitsuhama Music for hiring
shadowrunners to fuel trouble between two of his own
label's musicians. Yes, it sounds insane, I know, but that's
why I'm a cop, not an agent.
. It's not insane, it makes perfect business sense. There's
nothing like a tragic death to pump up sales. Hell, they can
even sell a posthumous deluxe special edition every year, at
three times the normal price.
· Tupac
. Has anyone noticed how some media outfits that originally
ridiculed or downplayed Or'zet music had a drastic about face
in the past few months? I'm talking about corps like MCT Music,
the same ones that reviled or ignored CrimeTime and other pio-
neers at first. Now they're glorifying the genre so badly that
you'd think the entire board of directors had Goblinized.
· Media Watcher
. Orxploitation is profitable and that's all she wrote.
· Reality Czech
. True, but I think Media Watcher has a point. They're not
focusing on the music, but on the "lifestyle" of these artists:
get-rich-quick attitudes, crime, violence, hedonism. The kids
in the slums are being bombarded with the notion that all
those things are right. I have a bad feeling about this ...

. Isn't everyone reading this trying to get rich through crime

On top of this, Organized Crime has warned us that the
industry is being infiltrated by the Vory v Zakone through
beachheads like Hez Music. This company is owned by two
Russian nationals: Josif "Joe" Radek and Sergei Malenkin.
Radek has long been a big name in the West Coast Vory,
while Malenkin has been tentatively connected with a group
of guns for hire. We don't have much more information on
their operations yet, but we are proceeding with caution.
. That's why I remembered Radek, he's one of the scariest
mobsters I've seen-smart, slick and charming, but with a dia-
mond sharp mind and heart of pure ice. And Malenkin is a
Russian expatriate connected to Chimera, those drek-hot KGB
assassins gone freelance. Personally, the mere idea of the Vory
and Chimera teaming up is enough to give me nightmares.
· X-Star
e Word is that Malenkin's no longer the contact point for
Chimera-he's retired, pursuing (semi-)legit biz.

things have changed, but my guess is that the poor fragger is
nothing more than a moneymaking puppet for the Russkies.
· SPD
OrgCrime suspects they've been using concerts for
money laundering and BTL traffic, but there might be more.
It seems that some fans disappear after attending a concert
or taking part of an artist party, only to resurface in prostitu-
tion and pornography rings. It won't be long before the
other syndicates try to get themselves a piece of the pie, a
move that could cause a dramatic escalation in violence.

here (The Yaks in Seattle and the Mob in LA). Expect some-

I have this chummer, a shadowrunner, I won't give his
name because what I'm about to tell you could seriously frag
up his reputation. He was hired to do pre-extraction surveil-
lance on a Shiawase employee. The usual; get close to him,
figure out the guy's routine. He got all dressed up in his best
Victory jumpsuit and headed into the arcology to have a look
around. It was easy to spot the extractee, the guy ran on a
timer. Every day at 1:15 sharp he adjourned for a late lunch
in the atrium, just as it cleared out of high school kids scur-
rying back to class. Well, on this day, a handful of high
school toughs decided to give my chummer some static on
their way back to class. It was the jumpsuit that set them in
motion apparently. They marked him from the moment he
walked in the door but had hesitated since they didn't know
whether he was being deliberately disrespectful by wearing
a rival corp's gear or simply didn't know the rules. It turns
out that he really didn't know the rules, but it was too late to
correct the mistake; the kids blew his cover. When they start-
ed razzing him, the extractee got a good look at who he
was. There was no chance of continuing surveillance after
that. A whole run ruined just because my friend wore the
wrong jumpsuit.
· Brand name and logo recognition has always been com-
mon among the fashionistas and glitterati of high society. but
now a new consciousness of certain clothiers' corporate affili-
ations is developing among certain corporate circles. Among
the upper ranks of certain megacorps (particularly
Japanacorps), it is increasingly becoming passé or even dis-
loyal to not sport threads produced by one of the corp's sub-
sidiaries-or even worse, to wear a rival corp's fashions.
Attending a meeting with S-K execs in a Zoë suite, for example,
is akin to slapping them in the face (Zoë is close to the Graf-
Beloit family, who have an unfriendly history with Lowfyr).

CHILDREN OF THE CORPORATION
The fraggers that ruined my
friend's day were part of a corp "gang"
(known as "bratpacks" to other
gangers), a common type of teen corp
kid rebellion. I know, because I used to
be in one during my corp days. Kids

pumped so full of corp pride you'd
think it was in the drinking water (actu-

ments. You grow up believing that
your megacorp is the center of the uni-
verse. From a very young age, they
groom you to be a cog. You're molded
to think, live and dress in a certain way. And the entire time
you're told that if you work hard, devote yourself to the corp and
do as you're told, you will be rewarded greatly.
Corp gangs are like hooligans or frat boys, all caught up
in corp nationalism and pride. If someone comes along act-
ing contrary to their corp's way of things, then these kids
react. They tighten ranks and suddenly everyone who isn't
with them better start thinking about getting out of the way.
My first corp gang experience took place in elementary
school. Everyone in the school knew that this one kid's par-
ents had been negotiating to transfer to another corporation.
By default, their son, my classmate, was turned into a pari-
ah. No one sat with him at lunch. He was always the last one
picked in sports. But that wasn't enough to get the message
across. Some of the older kids started talking about how that
one kid made us all look bad. So they spread the word that
it was time to take "corporate action." The word came down
the student pipeline that at a specified time and place every-
one who still believed in the corp was to come together and
show this poor kid why switching sides was a bad idea. I did-
n't even know most of the kids who showed up that day, but
we all had one goal on our minds. We beat the kid badly
enough to require corrective surgery, but not one of us was
ever disciplined for our actions.
. No one ever gets in trouble, so long as the "message" that
is sent doesn't result in death. The gangs are organized so
that the kids handing out the beatings usually don't even
know each other or the person getting beat; it's a coordi-
nated, anonymous corporate effort to weed out the inferior
members of the herd. In Asia, they've been at this kind of
brainwashing so long that's it has bled into the non-corpo-
rate youth. Here we have corporate posers who get togeth-
er in order to throw their weight around in the name of a cor-
poration they're really not a part of. They can be worse than
the actual corp kids because there is no corporate authority
to hold them in check.

BUYING YOUR LOYALTY
The corp gang phenomenon is just one example of how
the megacorps mold the minds of their subjects. These days,
the megacorps employ all sorts of tricks to buy their employ-
ee-citizens' loyalties and keep them in line. One common
tactic is the establishment of reward programs, where citi-
zens who perform well or go out of their way to serve their
corp are rewarded with vacation time, increased housing
privileges, credit with company stores and so on. A lot of
corps have taken this a step further. however, initiating
point-based incentive programs. If you're a Shiawase citizen,
for example, you'll be awarded points every time you do
something positive for the corp: buy Shiawase stock, finish a
project before deadline or watch a requisite amount of corp
programming on the trid. The points accumulate and serve
as a sort of status system within the corp. If your points are
high enough, you may be eligible for certain discounts or
benefits programs. If your points are higher than another
employee, then you'll beat him out to get that interoffice job
transfer. When you reach a certain threshold of points for the
first time, you may be surprised with an invite to a private
dinner with some corporate nobility (all trideod of course, for
broadcasting as corp propaganda later).
· When I was coming up in Yamatetsu, we used to earn
points by wearing clothing with the corporate logo on it. Now
it's common to see young executives sporting company tat-
toos because of the points it'll score with the brass.
. Long Tooth
. Heck, when I was in the Star, I knew a captain who handed
out extra points to officers that roughed up metas.
· X-Star
. That's where these systems get abused. I've been party to
several hastily negotiated bargains where someone low in
the corporation will carry out a secret assignment for some-
one higher up in exchange for the promise of points. It usual-
ly ends up involving shadowrunners.
· Corp Watcher
. Sometimes it doesn't matter how many points you rack up,
you're still going to get overlooked. Try being a meta in a
Japanacorp. Your SIN might also matter. Each country and
megacorp has its own range of SINs to issue to its citizens, so
the SIN you get at birth indicates which corporate "parent"
you have. If your SIN starts with 873, for example, that means
you were born as a Yamatetsu citizen. That number follows
you from birth to death, unless you get a new SIN or change
your identity. So if a wageslave has a SIN that says he's been
a corporate citizen from the day he was born, then he's more
likely to get better marks at his monthly review than a guy
who's fresh off the street. That's the way megacorp trust
works. You're born there, you stay there and they reward you.
Life is even difficult if you're born into one mega and go to
work for another. Sure, you may have switched over to
Shiawase for now, but the mentality there will never fully
accept someone who's SIN prefix screams Renraku-you can
never really trust someone who has already turned away
from a corporation once before.
· Expatriate
Points can be lost as easily as they are gained. In the
system you are taught to believe that company policy is
gospel. If you go against policy, you'll lose points for your-
self and, depending on the severity of the incident, possibly
for family and friends as well. Before I was recruited by spe-
cial ops, I was given a shot to earn big points by an exec I
met. He asked me to ruin a date between two co-workers of
his. I arranged for both meals to be spiked with a laxative.
The date was over before the main course. Normally that
kind of incident would have made the co-workers look bad.
but I hadn't done my homework. It turned out that they
weren't co-workers at all. She was the daughter of a promi-
nent VP from another division. He was her fiancé. The two
were able to trace the sabotage back to me and I went from
promising young student to hopeless reject in a day. Anyone
who continued to be around me risked losing points by
association. It got so bad that I tried to kill myself.
Fortunately Crashcart found me before I finished myself off.
. It's likely that Spiderhawk's disgrace was a setup from the
beginning. The exec who hired her used the promise of points
to take her down a few notches.
· Fallen Angel
. Sometimes the fraggers that run these points programs will
intentionally create a situation where you lose a large portion
of the points you worked hard for, as a test of your company
loyalty. Sometimes they'll do this right before handing you an
important promotion or assignment, to make sure you have
what it takes. And if you don't have what it takes, If you fall
apart and commit seppuku-well, there's always someone
else to take the job.
· Renraku Fox
. The situation is worse in regards to those who show magical
aptitude. Magic is an asset to any organization and when
they have the opportunity to make you believe that your life
should be dedicated to the preservation of that organization,
then they'll do whatever is necessary to make it happen.
· Aprés Glow
· Corps do what they have to do in order to keep their assets

to leave, I've handled plenty of unwilling extractions where
the person I was pulling out actually fought to stay. And it

wasn't because they were afraid of what the corp would

OTHER LEASHES
Naturally, corp gangs and reward programs are just the
tip of the iceberg. The megacorps use plenty of other tactics
to keep their citizens in line. For example, many corporations
encourage their employees to have families. Not only does
this help establish a corporate populace that will have been
raised under the corp's tutelage and care, but families are also
a sign of a stable employee-ie, person; one who isn't going
to run off in pursuit of better employment. After all, families
serve as excellent hostages and emotional leverage if the
employee is thinking of leaving or needs to be kept in line.
. Works both ways. Yakashima, Tanamyre and many other
corps encourage their employees to live a detached "plug-
in“ lifestyle. It helps the companies shuffle their employees
around, moving them to where they're needed, without dig-
ging up too many roots. Telestrian takes it even further by
encouraging temporary marriages. The corporation arranges
for new couples to take in foster children from the streets of
Portland to create that illusion of a family, only to break them
all apart and send them on their separate ways months later
when their skills are needed elsewhere.
· Wylthien
· Telestrian learned its tricks from Hisato-Turner. The homeless
children they rescue look like angels plastered all over pro-
paganda ads that show how valuable the corporation is to
the community. In reality, the kids are being recruited as part
of the corporate machine. They're encouraged to join into
the social networks established by the corp, and as adults
usually end up as part of internal snitch groups reporting
aberrant behavior among their colleagues. Some grow up to
become counselors charged with operating allegedly
"impartial" counseling services that in reality scan the ranks
for troubled employees.
· Corp Watcher
. The host couples themselves are often married through
cult-like devotional churches wholly sponsored by the corpo-
ration. The cults operate on a pyramid philosophy, requiring
certain trials such as marriage, psychological counseling and
evaluations in order to advance higher in the ranks. No mat-
ter how long you remain in the cult you never reach the top
of the pyramid to unlock those life altering secrets you were
promised when you started at the bottom. By then you've
been so conditioned by the system that the end destination
doesn't matter; it's the endless journey to get there.
· Fanatic
Trideo is another overlooked control mechanism. By
controlling what's on the trid corporations are really keeping
corp citizens as sheltered as possible from the real world and
indoctrinating them with corp jingoism and a corp-skewed
version of reality. Visit Tsimshian sometime, there's nothing
that hits the airwaves out there without MCT saying it's ok
first. I bought into every bit of drivel my corp shoved at me.
After twenty-seven years it finally took being left for dead in
order to stop believing in what they had to say.
. Making your own trid programming and running multiple
trid stations can be quite taxing. Certain lower level corps
specialize at editing and filtering programming for their peers
and the big boys. The biggest name in this biz is the Horizon
Group, a bunch of nova-hot PR and media pros.

LINK CLUBS
by Connie Connoisseur
OK, Captain Chaos asked me to look into the club scene
and I was like, "What for?" I mean club culture is getting so old
these days. There's nothing to add because nobody wants to try
anything new. Then I heard about a place called Link. The buzz
for the place was huge. I hadn't given it much thought because
the buzz for all new club openings is huge. If it isn't, then you're
not going to survive opening night. What caught my eye was
that Link did it one better. Link had clubs that were opening all
around the world on the same night. It was supposed to be a
24-hour party spot where you could club with friends a world
away. I whispered into a few ears and got a hold of a pair of VIP
passes. Wanna hear a first? I was really impressed.
Scan this, the Link clubs are networked, and not just in
the usual way. First off, when you walk in the door you can
check out a wiz and surprisingly fashionable headset that
receives wireless from the club's Matrix node. The headset
beams laser data onto your retina, so that your field of vision
is overlaid with Matrix data (your standard augmented reali-
ty-all you office drones know what I'm talking about). Why
is this cool? Because the Link clubs are virtually linked with
sister clubs across the globe. Sophisticated tridcam nets and
holo-displays allow you to "see" and party with people in cer-
tain areas of similar clubs around the planet, using your head-
set's earphones and microphone. Bands and DJs that are per-
forming at one club are also simulcast to the other clubs (but
on different channels, so you can choose who to groove to).
· If you have a headware radio and an image link, you can
receive directly from Link's wireless node. Or if you just have
a datajack and image link you can rent a micro-sized wire-
less receiver and jack in that way.

· It's also attracted a lot of hackers who'd love to strut their

like that would kill Link, so they invested heavily in IC and
hired freelance deckers to supplement defenses. You can
never be too safe when your nuyen is on the line.
· FastJack
It gets better. The clubs are also linked to their own
Matrix hosts, allowing virtual visitors to transmit their icons
real-time and interact with meatworld partygoers.
· The Matrix hosts are sculpted so that they feature real-time trid
from each of the clubs in different rooms. So you can log in, sit on
a couch and chat with someone who's physically sitting at a sim-
llar couch in London, then get up and go to another room to
dance with someone transmitting from New York. The weird thing
is that since so many of your fellow partiers are virtual representa-
tions, people walk "through" each other all the time.
· Neurosis
. It's a handy way of meeting folks who are spread out around
the world-or keeping tabs on someone from far away.

· This augmented reality tech has been around for a while,
but it's getting more popular. There's a similar system that's
soon to go online in a city in Japan. Renraku was originally
behind it, but they backed out due to internal problems, and
now Transys has taken it over.
· Renraku Fox
The Link's augmented reality system also makes full use
of social networking tools, making it easier for you to spot a
potential partner or someone with similar interests.
. What this means is that when you "look" at people, you'll see
whatever information they've entered in the system that they
want to "transmit" publicly-likes, dislikes, hobbies, drekcetera.
The clubs also allow you to tag virtual "post-its" on people and
share them with others in your customized peer network. Think
a guy is creepy? Tag him with a virtual note that only people
you have earmarked as friends can see,

As of now there are only seven Link clubs around the

GENE ART
by Trychosope
Genetics doesn't have to be about curing diseases, maik-
ing the perfect metahuman or anything else so abstract. Tailk
to the gene artists living on Park Avenue and you'll find out
that genetics can be a form of artistic expression. Just as
Michelangelo trumpeted his concept of genetic beauty with
David, so too can gene artists play God, painting their mas-
terpieces through the miracle of DNA.
Though genetic art has been around since the
Millennium with the unveiling of Alba the fluorescent green
rabbit, gene art really bloomed in the 2030s after the Euro
Wars. A group of corresponding European geneticists who
had fled the continent to avoid the conflicts found them-
selves in North America, where they began to focus on the
transgenic (using traits from two or more different species)
configuration of plant and animal genes. These doctors
shared ideas and research, collaborating to create modifica-
tions to a genetic structure that would allow a biological
organism to possess traits not previously seen in its species
before. In essence, these doctors were creating new species
of plants and animals. Don't confuse their intention, howev-
er, they weren't making super beasts. They were making art.
· Art my arse. How were they getting funding unless they
were doing something with business or military application?
· Richter
. Remember the time period. The world was in chaos, and
nations and corps were gobbling up hot shot scientists and
throwing money at them regardless of results. Besides, they
owned the trademark rights on completed work.
· Corp Watcher
Today's genetic artists manipulate the base genome to
add or delete cosmetic features such as color, size, smell, life
expectancy and many others. One of the top artists, Samuel
Byrne is known for creating vivid multi-colored roses that
stay in bloom for up to a year under proper conditions. Two
other top gene artists are Jonathan Gonzales, known for his
breathtaking work with butterflies, and Ichiro Iwamura, mas-
ter of the Fibonacci carnation. This year's Telfair art show in
Soho, NY, featured many new genetic artists; among the top
money winners was a genetic replica of a dodo bird, a turtle
with a frog's tongue and a bioluminescent tabby cat.
· People used to do these kinds of modifications to pets
through breeding. Genetics has taken mating completely out
of the loop, but it has opened the door to manipulations that
simply weren't possible before. Similar work is being done in the
corporate sector, of course, but the goals are vastly different.
· Kephalos
Gene art is immensely popular among the ultra rich and
corporate elite who love to commission pieces and impress
their friends with unique pets.

. The prestigious artists who have been producing for years
rake in big profits. Tobias Vierheller has made millions market-
ing pink-maned ponies to ultra-rich teenage equestrians. The
most unusual art I've encountered however was a falcon
that had gills and webbed feet. The bird would dive under-
water and remain there for hours at a time.
· Siobhan
Unlike genetic research that might seek to create and
then breed new species, the purpose for most genetic artists
is to create unique life forms that are not reproducible. As
such, most genetic art lacks reproductive capabilities. Many
artists also "brand" their work with a unique personal "water-
mark" in the genetic code that creates a unique marking at the
cellular level, verifiable by art dealers. Many artworks also fea-
ture built-in obsolescence.
. The rich collectors just eat up this one-of-a-kind, signed work
drek. Your hypoallergenic jet black collie with golden eyes is only
worthy as a status symbol if your peers can't get one of their
own. Of course, that just makes it worth stealing to somebody.

· Guerrilla Girl
Eco-activists love to go after these genetic artists who think
they're playing God. Some have even been known to target col-

· Green Pixie
· Commissioned work often includes a contract clause that
the artist will destroy all of his preparatory work so that the
same organism can't be duplicated.
· Ladybug
· Cloning is still a possibility with genetic art, of course, and
there is a market for knock-offs, especially when rich lady X
realizes her one-of-a-kind non-reproducing feathered puma is
about to kick the bucket, but she can't go on living without
bird-kitty at her side. The watermark used by many artists is
nearly impossible to hide, however-though some artists keep
the nature of their watermark a secret, so who's to know?

GAMBLING
by Leisure Suit Leo
You don't have to be a wiseguy to appreciate the sound
of your cred multiplying with each toss of the dice or flip of
the cards. Everybody gambles. The little old lady at the
supermarket, the nosy neighbor who opens the door every
time you come home, your fixer-hell, even your pastor
goes for a couple of spins when the mood hits him.
Gambling is a huge part of our mainstream culture. It's also
completely corrupt. Gambling went sideways a long time
ago. I can't tell you when it happened but there isn't a bet
that gets covered these days without a Yak, a Mob wiseguy
or someone else taking a cut. The last clean gambling fron-
tier is probably the national lottery systems, but guys like the
Chromed Accountant will tell you that the government is
taking more than its share of taxes.
. My work here is done. On to the next SIG.
· The Chromed Accountant
Surprisingly, Matrix gambling ventures are less corrupt
then their physical counterparts. I think it has to do with how
nervous people are to begin with when it comes to gambling
online. When I'm playing cards, I feel a whole lot safer with
the actual cards in my hand then I do with bits of code
clutched between my digital fingers, even though there's no
difference in the chances of me actually getting hustled. A
good dealer can do anything to my cards that a decker
could, but when it happens online more people are willing
to blame the format. Matrix casinos keep it pretty close to
the vest for that reason. The card and dice games are as fair
as can be.
· Casinos had to ban certain types of headware from the
roulette table. A chummer like me with an encephalon and a
math co-processor can determine odds like nobody's business.
· The Muffin Man
GAMBLING AND THE LAW
When you put gambling and law in the same sentence,
you're focusing on the drek that the government says is
acceptable to bet on. Usually that's casino gambling and bet-
ting on regulated sports such as football, combat biking and
basketball; the stuff that you can find Vegas lines on in your
morning e-paper. Crime syndicates love legalized gambling,
not only for the money it makes them, but also because it
gives them a safe avenue to launder money from less legal
operations. If someone loses a hundred grand in BTL money
at the casino, nobody asks the casino where they got the
money. That makes gambling a quick fix for a syndicate's
laundering needs.
Gambling legislation varies from nation to nation. The
majority legalize it in certain designated areas like authorized
casinos and riverboats. Off track betting offices and similar
organizations allow you to place bets on the dogs and ponies.
Most corps have patterned their casino operations along sim-
ilar lines when they have them at all. Then there's bingo and
keno that you can find at almost any church. Local authorities
put a nuyen limit cap on that type of activity, but churches
can get around that by making it look like a portion of the
take is going towards church donations. You wouldn't believe
me if I told you how often we had to send wiseguys to talk to
the local pastor about his Saturday night party. As for every-
thing else, only a handful of cities are treated to privileged
policies that allow gambling anywhere within city limits.
. Don't go to the OTB Matrix kiosks, go to a live office. You'll
usually find someone there who is willing to handle your other
gambling business.
· NASCAR Dave
Matrix casinos are supposedly under the jurisdiction of
the host nation but most data sites are hosted offshore or
through orbitals where federal jurisdiction doesn't apply.
They can set whatever cap they want on betting and don't
have to follow what state and federal gambling commissions
refer to as a minimum internal control standard. Without
that, your odds for winning go down a drekload because a
slot can payout at whatever percentage the owner wants it
to. That could mean that the average nickel slot pays only
once every forty or so pulls. High dollar betting is what pays

ILLEGAL GAMBLING
Illegal gambling covers everything from the office betting
pool to underground pit fighting. You can bet on anything if you
can find someone to take your action. The most likely candi-
dates are the organized crime syndicates. The Mafia and the

Yakuza are top notch when it comes to gambling. They're the
ones you see operating gambling houses in the back of restau-
rants or upstairs in the club's "special" VIP room. Both groups
run numbers, a lottery style bet that's limited to certain neigh-
borhoods. Daily winnings for the numbers are only around four
or five grand but your odds for winning are high because you're
only playing against people from your own neighborhood.
· The Yakuza aren't always top notch. They run a lot of small-
time pachinko parlors nestled away in Asian communities,
with games like mahjong, fan-tan, lotteries, dice games and
more. The Triads do the same. These places are a lot more
corrupt; they rip people off like there's no tomorrow, but their
customers always come back and don't complain.

First tier organizations cover every type of bet, even host-
ing their own events such as paracritter matches and pit fights.
It's sometimes tough to get into one of the events, though.
Security screens people that the organization doesn't normally
do business with in order to avoid police infiltrating the opera-
tion. We had a tournament in Seattle get broken up last month
because a runner blabbed to the wrong person.
Second tier groups like the Triads and the Seoulpa Rings
try to be more specialized. The Triads are big into pit fight-
ing and ponies. Seoulpa Rings like to pretend they're junior
Yakuza and cover all the gambling they cover, but on a small-
er scale. The Vory do a little bit of everything.
Street gangs and independents make up the last level of
illegal gambling operators. Fixers fall into this last category
as do the majority of sports bookies. Don't get me wrong,
the Mob does have its own bookies, but your local bookie
may not be with the Mob. He's probably just a guy who has
the money to cover his friends' bets and has access to a
Matrix gambling site.
e If that's the case, then the Mob isn't doing their job. You
don't let a freelancer work your turf. It can cost you profits.
Guys like that get fitted with a pair of new sea boots, know
what I mean?

If you're looking for the down and dirty stuff like cock-

to a Yardies party where they were betting on devil rats.
Believe me, if it can fight, someone will bet on it.

. Gambling isn't limited to sport or violence. In my former line
of work, I came across a fair number of corporate gambling
oddities such as black stock exchanges where gamblers bet
on the end of day figures of the S&P 500, the Dow, NASDAQ
and similar indicators. The most interesting of these corporate
betting schemes were the so-called "futures markets," where
you place bets on the outcomes of world and corporate sit-
uations, conflicts and developments. Naturally, you can
make a killing here if you helped to shape those events that
are about to go public.
. The Chromed Accountant
DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOUR BOOKIE IS?
You want to find a bookie? Go to a bar, preferably a
sports bar. He'll be the one staring at the sports ticker and
making notes in his p-sec. Street bookies will take just about
anyone's bet. They may not be able to cover every sport or
every amount though. If he can't handle your action, he'll
know someone who can. It's a bookie's job to know what
action is going on in their neck of the woods. They'll know
where the higher level gambling is in a city, just like a fixer
knows where a shadowrunner can find work.
The amount of money a bookie will allow you to bet also
depends on how well they know you. The first few times you
bet with a new bookie you'll be capped at a very low num-
ber to make sure that you can pay and more importantly,
that you're not a cop. If you pass the test phase your aver-
age bookie will give you a line of credit they know you're
good for. There are different ways of handling folks who
don't pay up come collection day. Most of them result in a
trip to the hospital.
. The major cruise lines are sensitive to the needs of their clients.
In addition to legal gambling, they'll keep a stable of bookies
on board to handle special requests from the passengers.

Finding an online gambling den is even easier then
catching up to a bookie. The entry level spots are legal so all
you have to do is search the net till you find something
you're comfortable with. Sleaze past all the "our spot is bet-
ter than yours" drek. It's just like the Vegas strip; your odds
are pretty similar wherever you bet, the only thing that
changes is the scenery. When you're done playing around,
try to hook up with someone who looks like they know what
they're doing. The big time net casinos have recruiters look-
ing for players who are ready to spend money. If you seem
to be a person willing to play with the big boys, and you
have a large credit balance, you'll get an invite.

GAMBLING HOT SPOTS
Here are a couple of tips on where to go if you want to
do some serious gambling. All of the places below are the
best I know. Some are good for beginners, while others you
shouldn't try unless you're willing to sacrifice a big bankroll.
Grid 19
The Grid is a Matrix hotspot for people who have the
habit but don't have a whole lot of cred to support it. Grid
slots pay out around 20 percent of the time, higher than any-
where else I've cruised. Their payouts are low nuyen but you
can enjoy yourself for hours on a handful of cred. If you're
into betting on sports, the Grid can take your action. I go
there to place my Desert War bets. They also do the horse
races, same as OTB.
. Grid 19 has been known to cover high-limit action from their
regulars. There's a standing Tuesday night poker game that's
five grand just to get in, with a 100¥ ante.
· Slamm-O!
Las Vegas
The Strip still sizzles after all these years. Vegas has it all:
gambling, glitz and girls, girls, girls. The Comanche Mob dug
its claws into the city's illegal operations, but the Verontesse
family is still in charge. Gambling is legal anywhere in the
city, something the families take full advantage of. The law
doesn't bother much with stopping the illegal stuff, so long
as they get their cut. Check out the warehouse district if
you're interested in seeing what a paracritter can do up
against a metahuman. Spread a little cred around and you'll
find that doors open rather easily down here.
. If you win a multi-million dollar payout in Vegas, don't bother
collecting it. The Vegas mobs don't want to pay that kind of cred.
It looks good to see someone win, but you ever wonder what
happens to the big winners afterwards? The casino is going to try
to convince you to stay on a little bit longer so you can gamble it
all away. They'll comp you a super suite, free show tickets, dinners
and anything else to hold on to you long enough to get their cred
back. If all else fails, you might happen to get cacked climbing
into your shiny new limo on the way to the airport.

New Monaco
I've been following this Grand Tour thing on the news, try-
ing to figure out the angle on it. All I can see is that a lot of folks
like me are making money because rich folks want to prove
how much they can spend. Don't bother with Monaco in the
summer if your credstick ain't ebony. New Monaco belongs to
the tour and gambling is both fashionable and mandatory to
maintain social status. The city's world famous waterfront casi-
nos host international prizefights year round, culminating in
championship bouts during the tour season. The European Jai-
lai league holds its all-star game in New Monaco every sum-
mer, timed with tour travel.

e The Monaco Grand Prix gets a bunch of attention, not just
from the Grand Tour crowd either. NASCAR bettors always put
money on the race because some of their drivers originally
came from this circuit. A bookie can make a sizable stake if she
pulls in enough local and international action from the race.

Lesvos Island
Go there for the tanned Grecian women, the hot springs

one of the all night poker games. Lesvos has a secret life
after dark. The gambling community congregates in base-
ments and dock houses engaging in the fiercest betting I've
had the pleasure to take part in. It's all completely illegal,
mind you, but the cops are trading cred just like the next
guy. If you're into organized sports, there's a stadium on the
sister island of Lemnos that hosts soccer matches and com-
bat biking. Betting goes all through the night, ending with
the illegal meta duels deep in the Petrified Forest. There's
plenty of work for shadowrunners here, running security or
recruiting for the duels.

and hunting for wild satyrs to battle local contestants. For
some reason the locals seem afraid to do it.

Atlantic City
Call it Old Faithful, a little burb outside of the Newark
sprawi that forgot a long time ago what the rules were.
Atlantic City is one of the oldest gambling cities in North
America. The casinos are empty more often than they are
full. The streets are run down and choked with the SINless.
Everything you want in a city for gambling, neh?
Atlantic City still has its regulars from Newark and New
York, and every so often a good commercial campaign will
spring up and renew interest in the place. That wanton desper-
ation is what's appealing about Atlantic City. Desperate people
tend to look the other way for a fast buck. You'll find that the
locals are willing to do just about anything for cred, including
betting on their lives in human hunts or Russian roulette.
. Once a year the glitterati descend on this city for the Miss
America pageant. It's a strange tradition if you think about it.
Eleven months out of the year Atlantic City is a wasteland for
washed up gambling addicts still trying to live the good life,
then once a year they dust off the street sweepers and call
in NYPD Inc. for extra support so they can parade a gaggle
of supermodels in front of a runway camera and pretend
that everything in the city is well and good.

TOP 10 SHADOWRUNS OF 2063
· As a workforce, shadowrunners are vastly under-appreciat-
ed. How many times have you been given credit or props for
your best runs? If you do your job right, the answer should be
"not at all." Let's face it, the nature of our business means that
we can't talk about our business, which means that the most
successful runners are the ones the public hasn't heard about.
It's nice once in a while, though, to see some evidence
of our handiwork make the news. So with that in mind, here's

1. The Crash of RDA 319
GENEVA (SOL)-Search and rescue teams report finding
no survivors in the wreckage of suborbital flight RDA 319.
which crashed in a remote part of the Swiss Alps two nights
ago. The Federated-Boeing 828 was en route from the
Europort to Cape Town, carrying 144 passengers. Authorities
now believe the craft was hit by debris from a re-entering satel-
lite. < Posted 9-13-63>
Constantinople (AP)-German journalist Montyn Reinhart,
known for his coverage of NEEC corporate politics, was found
dead in his hotel room last night. Police report that Reinhart com-
mitted suicide by overdose and say there is no evidence of foul
play. < Posted 11-14-63>
. That suborbital crash wasn't a freak accident, my friends.
Reinhart was looking into it when he was killed. He had
already turned up records indicating that the Mitsuhama
Oblos 4 satellite implicated in the crash was supposed to
crash down in the Pacific Ocean. Security records show an
unauthorized outside connection to the satellite just
moments before it re-entered. Much to Mitsuhama's dismay,
Reinhart turned up some Oblos satellite hardware floating
around on Constantinople's black market. Rumor was the
parts included some embedded datachips with interesting
info on them. Whatever he scored, though, was missing from
his hotel room when they found his body.

major breakthroughs in some of their wireless projects and
Mannstein was a lead designer for a nova-hot R&D team. Of
course Mannstein was also sending out feelers to S-K as
recently as a few days before the crash. I guess Erika wanted
to keep their secrets.

2. Epoxy Factory Explosion Leaves Novatech in Sticky
Situation
EAST ST. LOUIS (NN)-Novatech Press Secretary Mike
Falcone announced earlier today that residents displaced by
last week's Epoxitech factory explosion could now return
home. Residents were displaced last Thursday when an
explosion at the plant sent a mile-high plume of toxic smoke
into the East St. Louis skyline. Nine people were killed and
twenty-five injured in the blast.
Falcone refused to comment on the effect that the loss of
Epoxitech would have on Novatech as a whole. Epoxitech, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Novatech, was the sole remain-
ing holding that produced a proprietary heat-resistant epoxy
vital for the production of top of the line cyberdecks.
Formerly, Novatech possessed three companies capable of
producing the epoxy. Late last year it was forced to close two
of the three to cut expenses. Renraku is the only other major
worldwide producer of an epoxy similar to the one that had
been produced by Epoxitech. Renraku declined to comment
at press time, but it is unlikely that they would undertake a
favorable contract with Novatech given a recent accusation of
price fixing Renraku made against a Novatech subsidiary.
Novatech's stock price was unaffected by this announce-
ment. Novatech is a privately held company and its stock is not
traded on any major indexes. < Posted 11-12-63>
. This couldn't have come at a worse time for Novatech.
Their CAS subsidiaries have suffered a rash of hostile takeover
attempts lately, among numerous other setbacks and prob-
lems the corp is facing. Word is that Novatech's budget is so
deep in the red that the other AAAs are starting to make
some pointed comments and suggestions in Corporate Court
meetings-not to mention circling like sharks.

3. Local Militia Repels Invaders
CHICO-OROVILLE (AP)-Ares forces today reported
repelling a "significant" attack from General Saito's troops after
receiving help from locals. Several motorized columns of
Protectorate troops initiated what one Ares spokesperson
described as a flanking maneuver. An Ares checkpoint unit
engaged the troops, but was quickly driven back. The column,
however, encountered stiff resistance at the hands of local mili-
tia and was forced to withdraw. Other skirmishes were also
reported in the area, but no casualty reports are available.
Chico-Oroville Mayor Mallory Tarkington condemned the
attack and called upon General Saito to lift his "siege" of the
Chico-Oroville Greater Metropolitan Area. < Posted 2-7-63>
. That "local militia" wasn't exactly that local. Ares hired
every runner on the west coast they could find on two day's
short notice, told them a location, set up an ad hoc com-
mand hierarchy and sent them to repel Salto's forces. The
only Ares forces on hand were the troops guarding the dam
and airfields-and Mr. Johnson.
· Cougar
· Saito must be kicking himself for not moving to take that dam
early on. If he gets control of it, he can put major leverage on
the whole Central Valley, which depends on it for their water
supply. But he spent too much time rounding up metahumans,
so Ares and various locals managed to scramble together
enough of a defense around Chico-Oroville to make it too
costly for Saito to try. This latest move was Saito's attempt to
finish surrounding the COGMA and completely cut it off.

than "stopping the attack." Some got paid in equipment, but

guerrilla fight, and we had the element of surprise. I think a few

· Typical Azzie spin doctoring; the truth was far more inter-

rious scheme after another, each bloodier than the last. Our
friends at Overwatch tell us that they think Pax's crew is
responsible for the deaths of nearly forty otaku across North
America in the past year, including two whole tribes that
were completely wiped out. Dozens of other otaku have
gone missing, presumably kidnapped or killed by Ex Pacis.
Their cell seems to be working towards some fast approach-
ing goal as their actions have increased in frequency and
sightings of key members have been more common.
. Pax's little minions have been hard at work creating more
of her so-called "dissonance wells." We've gotten reports
from otaku who have stumbled across areas of the Matrix
that they make them feel unclean and impede their con-
nection to the Deep Resonance for a period after contact.
· Syzygy
· While Pax herself has managed to remain free and clear,
there are reports that Amor was nearly killed in a shoot-out in
Quebec earlier this year and that he was seriously wounded.
· Glitch
. Amor must have recovered pretty quickly since he was in
St. Louis last week with a handful of Ex Pacis on a "recruit-
ment drive." The three street kids supposedly killed in that rit-
ual murder that the media has been going on about were his
doing. They were all otaku, and the youngest girl was very
strong. His near-death experience seems to have made him
even more of a twisted fragger than he was before.

3. Nico di Rocco
Have you ever seen a big shot Vory boss plead for his life?
If not, then you missed the tridclip making the Matrix rounds
of the execution of Vory lideri Pjotr Vanavskaja. Vanavskaja
was shot in the head in the middle of the sidewalk of
Antwerp's busy shopping at midday, surrounded by horrified
onlookers. Public wetwork like this happens to be the typical
handiwork of Nico di Rocco. This enigmatic Italian killer-for-
hire has systematically been weakening the ranks and morale
of the Vory in the City of Diamonds ever since he sided with
the Albanian gangs in the current European mob war. Di Rocco
seems able to appear out of nowhere to take out even the
most heavily secured targets. Backed by a band of shady mer-
cenaries and runners, he's been icing Vory soldiers, lieu-
tenants, middle-men and diamond traders, one by one.
. Di Rocco is not only working hard to rack up the body
count-he's also responsible for some very lucrative diamond
heists, stealing hundreds of these little gems from Russian con-
trolled vaults.
· III Padre
. This fellow is some kind of a mystery. With no records,
nobody knows who he is or where he comes from. The most
persistent rumour revolves around his ties with the Marseille
Milieu, the French branch of the Alta Commissione.

4. Henry "the Diplomat" Uribe
BTL dealers have had a rough year, thanks to the CAS,
Pueblo and UCAS all cracking down on illegal shipments and
high-profile raids on several high-volume BTL factories. At
least one person has gained from this dry spell: one Henry
Uribe, the so-called "Foreign Minister" for the Ghost Cartels.
If your sprawl has seen an influx of good old-fashioned nar-
cotraffic, you can bet that Uribe has been in town to have a
friendly talk with the local authorities. Uribe fronts for various
cartels with similar interests, which makes him número uno
on the competition's hit list. Word is that several Mob fami-
lies are looking to remove him from the picture.

Manaus, Lima, Quito, Atlanta, Washington and, get this, Geneva.

Sarajevo last summer. Under contract to the NEEC, Argus
accidentally flagged Musawi's insertion into the region as a
low priority, assuming he was meeting Muslim leaders in
Islamic enclaves ahead of the conference. Remote surveil-
lance analysis later confirmed that Musawi met for several
hours with the three suicide bombers who blew themselves
up at the Sarajevo City Hall, killing ten peace delegates and
fourteen other bystanders.
· Eyewitnesses and electronic records indicate the suicide
bombers waded through a hail of bullets from heavily armed
MET2000 mercs assigned as security for the talks. They ran
right into the main atrium and blew themselves up in the mid-
dle of a stunned group of Serbian, Dinaric and Croat diplo-
mats. This has set the peace process back a decade and left
many people scared drekless.

· Big on magic or high on drugs?

6. Matthias Hesse
This second-generation neo-fascist is the son of Christian
Hesse, leader of the Hamburg Volksfront chapter
(2018-2039) and founding member of Nationale Aktion.
(Currently Dad is in a Hannover prison for life for master-
minding the 2047 bombing of the AGS Labor Union
Conference.)
As the saying goes, "The apple doesn't fall far from the
tree," and Matthias has become more extremist than even
his father. Embodying the ultranationalist and xenophobic
spirit that modern Germany hoped was dead and buried, the
young Hesse is suspected to be one of Nationale Aktion's
top leaders. Hesse apparently planned the Munich
Olympiapark VITAS attack of 2061, which claimed the lives
of over 8.000 metahumans and aid workers. Like all
Nationale Aktion leaders, Hesse has a 50,000 prize on his
head and tops Europol's Most Wanted list.
· Hesse went underground after Munich, but intelligence
reports suggest he's been in London, Vienna, Zurich and
Oslo. Busy little terrorist isn't he?

7. Canary
The Denver Zone Defense Force has posted a reward for
information leading to the capture of a magical terrorist
whom they have identified only as "Canary." Canary is
believed responsible for more than forty raids from Seattle to
Australia. Spell signature analysis links all these attacks to
Canary, an individual of powerful magical ability. Eyewitness
reports from several raids report that the perpetrator escaped
by shapeshifting into a yellow bird, hence his nickname.
. There's an interesting pattern to these attacks. All targets
were great dragon holdings, sometimes quite indirectly. The
Draco Foundation and Ghostwalker account for six incidents
between them. Why frag with great dragons in this way?

8. "Mr. Brown"
The con artist known only as "Mr. Brown" (some of his bet-
ter known aliases include Fats Walker, Neil Gregorich and "The
Straight Man") preys on ambitious fixers and fences. He's
allegedly Awakened, though nobody's sure if he's a magician
or an adept. He is suspected to be able to change his apparent
age, size, weight, skin tone and even metatype from score to
score. Typically, his schemes involve posing as a Mr. Johnson
with a highly lucrative shadowrun offer that requires a sub-
stantial investment from a fixer to pull off-only once the run
has gone down the haul goes poof, and the fixer's resources
along with it. He has also been known to pose as a fence laun-
dering goods or a fixer middleman who shakes down both
Johnsons and runners. Two unidentified women have occa-
sionally joined in on his scams. So far, he has reported as oper-
ating in Santa Fe, Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Atlanta.

Hell, it could be a crew of con artists who just switch off tak-

apparently broadened his sphere of operations to the
Mediterranean and along the West African Coast. Like most
of his ilk, Kane seems to thrive on the media attention
gained through his exploits.
Hey Kane, whatever happened to that competition

"Nothing personal, just business." Yeah, try telling that to

some serious anger management issues, in that she takes
everything personally. Even if you have the misfortune of just
being in her way, she'll go out of her way to extract her "kilo
of flesh," as she likes to say. It doesn't matter who you are;
she once crucified (yes, cross and all) a Pueblo Mr. Johnson on
his own front yard and subsequently had to flee to Seattle,
leaving a trail of dead double-crossers in her wake.

1. Art Dankwalther
So anyone with a lick of economic sense can see that
Novatech is struggling. What few people, particularly outside
of the shadows, are willing to say is that this is due in no small
part to a man named Art Dankwalther. (Some of you may
remember our expose on Art in the Threats 2 folio. To sum-
marize, he inherited enough nuyen from Dunkelzahn to be a
gazillionaire, only he's rather sore that Fuchi canned him and
so he's taking it out by attempting to take Novatech down.)
Though Richard Villiers and Novatech have deftly maneu-
vered to deflect many of Art's sabotage efforts, Mr.
Dankwalther has proceeded from nibbling around the edges
to taking whole bites out of Novatech's holdings. Novatech's
situation wouldn't be so bad if they were on stronger footing,
but the megacorp was heavily leveraged in its bid to take
Fuchi's Corporate Court seat, and it still hasn't recovered.
Novatech has sent Mr. Dankwalther several peace offers in
an attempt to buy him off, but all were summarily refused. The
latest news is that Novatech has placed a five million nuyen
bounty-dead or alive-on Art. Of course, a counter rumor
floating around is that Dankwalther is willing to beat that offer
if whoever takes it pulls an unspecified job for him instead.
. Some of those peace offers were returned in pieces.
Dankwalther's thirst for revenge has only intensified since he
started going after Villiers directly. There's been some talk
around the executive back rooms at Novatech that maybe
it's time for Villiers to step down.
· Einstein
. The shadows are hot with ops and counter-ops between
Novatech and Art. Novatech Is getting desperate, which is

especially anyone working for a dragon. Oddly enough, from
what I can tell, the wyrm doesn't want to buy or steal the
Codex-he wants to give Page something that he'll find use-
ful for his continued translation efforts. I expect plenty of peo-
ple would be interested in intercepting that exchange.

4. Jørgen Masterson
Zeta-ImpChem has its hounds searching after Jørgen
Masterson, director of research and development at Z-IC's
Nanotech Research Center 12, after unknown shadowrunners
extracted him from the site. The runners killed all the guards,
scientists, and technicians on duty in the white room where
Masterson was working at the time. Highly sophisticated
micro-drones jammed electronic surveillance, disabled
rigged security systems and later self-destructed. The intrud-
ers destroyed all computers and backups with magically cre-
ated electrical surges.
Masterson, a practicing Asatru Norwegian and multiple
PhD graduate of Oslo University, made a name for himself as
the brains behind the pioneering nanotech startup MicroFlek.
Z-IC bought MicroFlek and its multi-million nuyen licenses in
2062. Masterson stayed on with Z-IC as R&D director, work-
ing on security and military nanotech applications while pur-
suing his own nanotech projects on the side. Z-IC has not yet
disclosed whether Masterson was a willing accomplice or
not in the deadly extraction.

the Transys fiasco, but Dietrich Kleinfort was sticking up for
Bernal and thwarting efforts to have him removed. Junior, on

Desperate to return to the top seat, Antonio has been seek-

subject of speculation again: the Ute Nation and Novatech.
Novatech's recent difficulties have made any news related to

within Ute have many people alarmed.

making contact with Ute underground dissidents to foment
an overthrow of the current government. They say he hopes

Allied German States, Damocles is someone a lot of
Eurocorps want to talk to, and not in a friendly chat sort of
way, if you understand what I mean.
. They're too late. The Mr. Johnson who hired runners to pro-
tect the guy got himself surgically altered, betrayed
Damocles at the end of the ten days, and took over his iden-

Vatican. She was supposed to be vacationing but came home
with a souvenir-missing S-K executive, Jonathan Blake. Call

Blake had gone underground, leaving his position as an
acquisitions VP at S-K and melting into the shadows. Rumors
surfaced that Blake may have been one of Dunkelzahn's so-
called Watchers. With Daviar bringing him in from the cold,
those rumors returned with a vengeance.
After returning to the states, Blake was bequeathed a
large amount of Wuxing stock, presumably from an undis-
closed portion of the dragon's will. He took a VP of execu-
tive operations position with Wuxing and was immediately
ushered off to Hong Kong.

it. The basement is an industrial style pit with bleachers and
bars featuring flame-blowing bartenders. Every night, drone
fighting contests draw large crowds of locals off the street.
The ground floor, in contrast, is a top-notch restaurant with
real non-soy entrees, and a skybox view of the fights. There
is plenty of security both above and below given the clien-
tele and nature of the establishment.
. Lots of highbrow socialites brave a danger-filled trip into the
Atlanta sprawl to visit the Scrap. It's also a great place to find
someone to fix up your bike, or help you get your hands on
military surplus gear. There are lots of tech-heads that hang

4. The Red Lion-Waterfront District, Cape Town, Azania
If the biz ever takes you down around Azania, make sure
you have a chance to swing by the Red Lion at some point
on your trip. Situated along the Waterfront district of Cape
Town, the Red Lion boasts not only some of Azania's finest
cuisine, but also has some of the best jazz to be found south
of the equator. (The world-famous Athlone Feet played here
many nights before stardom took them trotting around the
world.) The owner, Micah Annobil-Dodoo, used to run the
Azanian shadows, so he knows everyone and everything
important. Just make sure you're polite and discreet, though;
Micah doesn't like it when his high-spending highbrow
clientele get scared away by some smelly cybermonster.
. It's rumored that during his running days, Micah ended up
developing a special working relationship with the great

5. Mercado-The Meat Market, Lisbon, Portugal
If you're ever in Lisbon, hop down to the old flooded
waterfront. Within walking distance of the big ferry and rail
terminal of Cais do Sodré lies the Mercado. Formerly a grand
old market, it has now been transformed into a partially open-
air nightclub and pit-fight venue. It's serviced by a number of
elevated catwalks and every form of water taxi you can imag-
ine, so getting there is easy. Getting in is not so easy.
Trambolho and Martelo, the troll bouncers, are pretty selec-
tive of who they let in-the more cred you look like you have,
the likelier you are to get in. The place is run cooperatively by
the Baptista mob, who handle the gambling and chip trade,
and the Kussundulola Cartel, who handle the flesh trade-
which ironically makes it the safest place in town.
The Mercado is a fave with mercs on R&R, runners and
executives looking for a good time, making it the perfect
place to do biz. Plus the background noise of the pit-fight
crowd is useful and the fights are an attraction unto them-
selves, from grudge matches between mercs to UFC gladia-
tors to paracritter fights.
. Obviously, this isn't the warmest and friendliest place to have
your meets, but it's the place to go to get some anonymity and
the regulars are discreet if nothing else. Plus you can even put
some money on the fights or get in on the casino action that
takes place on the first floor enclosed terraces.

fight scene make their start in the Mercado. Some Gladio

6. Sparta-Buenos Aires, Argentina
No one can blame you if you hear "merc haunt" and
imagine a sleazy, noisy bar where grunts spend their cred on
booze and joygirls; truth is, plenty fit that description, but not
Sparta. This small Argentinean country club breaks the mold.
The drinks are okay, the golf course is good and the cuisine is
out of this world. The real fun is the no-nonsense crew visit-
ing it: mercs, military officers, corp suits, diplomats and intel-
ligence agents flock to the place, making it wiz for finding
new contacts or getting juicy jobs. That is, if you get invited.
. Want to hear something really funny? All the people at
Sparta have served on the front lines in one campain or
another against Amazonian expansionism. Makes you won-
der what else goes on behind those walls.

7. Gunther's-Ork Underground, Seattle, UCAS
Few people think of the Ork Underground and "great
place to grab a bite to eat" in the same sentence-unless you
have a taste for devil rats. A troll couple named Gunther and
Bertha are changing that, though, setting up a barbeque joint
that is starting to turn heads. Gunther, a Gator shaman,
recently retired from running the shadows because, as he
says, he "wasn't getting enough ribs-not to mention enough
trid." While the service may be a little slow, the ribs are some
of the best in town and the beer is quality Ork Underground
homebrew. While it is an equal opportunity establishment,
Gunther prefers orks and trolls. If you're a shadowrunner,
especially tusk-endowed, it's a great place to meet, talk shop
and occasionally get some healing from the owner.
. And don't even think of starting trouble there. Bertha wields
shish-kebob spikes like a master ninja.

8. Wiki Stopover-Seattle RTG
Wiki for short, this is one of the oldest and most eclec-
tic clubs in the Matrix. Originally a prototype host for the
collaborative and distribution software used for Shadowland,
the Wiki Stopover's primary feature is its user-editable decor.
Patrons can download a utility to make new rooms or alter
existing ones. Any room ever created is accessible, though
the system removes rooms that haven't been visited for
extended periods, and some unpopular rooms are harder to
find. The primary "common" areas have stricter rules on
redecoration, but the décor nevertheless evolves continual-
ly. The main Wiki system provides movement, services and
support, but icon artists have a fair amount of latitude in the
imagery they can use.
· Wiki's a showcase for upcoming sculpting talent, not to
mention Matrix vandals who like to be able to cut loose with-
out setting off alarms. The clashing atmosphere and styles
can get irritating, but you can also use your filters to cut
down on this. The cool thing is just how much of it there is. You
can spend days in there without repeating rooms (and even
if you do they may have changed).
· Grid Reaper
. The sculpting for the interface connecting all the rooms
changes regularly too. Initially it was an endless corridor of
doors, but I've also seen a flat plain of gopher holes and a
galaxy theme. Some popular rooms are "1 cm Tall,"

. Not all rooms are accessible-there are a few tricks you
can use to make them private, which is handy for secure vir-

rooms-rumors persist that certain hacker crews use some of
the older and more inaccessible rooms as secret stashes for
their own paydata archives.

9. The Flying Dutchman-Fort Dauphin, Madagascar
Sea Ghost is a "retired" pirate that decided he could
make a better cut selling stale beer and cheap rum to his
mates than he could getting shot at by naval cutters. So he
settled down on the only spot of land in Madagascar that
even remotely resembles civilization and opened the Flying
Dutchman. He's made a fairly good run at it and now owns
one of the hottest places to do biz on the pirate isle. If you
need anything, literally, Sea Ghost or one of his patrons is
probably selling it. If not, they know where you can get it,
cheap, quick and no questions asked. A word to the wise,
though; Sea Ghost has more tolerance for runners than most
pirates, but some of his regulars will still test you if they
smell the shadows on you.
. And be sure to come well armed and able to use what
you're packing. I was in there a few months back and saw
some idiot kill himself when he got entangled in his
monowhip. He didn't die immediately; the pirates let him
bleed out on the floor for a few hours before he went quiet.

10. The Fish Hop-Galveston, CAS
This world-class Gulf Coast underwater resort is the hot
vacation spot for folks with nuyen to blow. Its proximity to
Aztlan also makes it a shadowhaven, renowned for spawn-
ing some big time runs in recent years. Privacy is unrivaled,
as each main room at the Fish Hop opens into an underwa-
ter bowl with thick glass walls that reveals a startling view of
the oceanic world. Physical security is respectable, and the
magical security is downright scary.
. The Fish Hop isn't really fully underwater. They have built off
of three old oil rigs that they now house the generators for the
place. Those places are where most of the security is con-
centrated, for obvious reasons.

Atlantean Foundation authorities have demanded an explana-

magical attack. < Posted 07-01-63>

interfering with their plans to build a maglev launcher on the
mountain, so they went all out. We're talking a Wild Hunt or
Ghost Dance type of ritual here. Almost every spirit near the
mountain was banished and those that remained were
shredded by crack anti-spirit astral strikes. Word is that the
corps already have some sort of spirit barrier half-completed
to keep them from coming back. This is one project the corps
aren't playing around with anymore.

2. Martian Meteor Mystery
SAN FRANCISCO (NN)-A Mitsuhama Thaumaturgical
Research lab was leveled Thursday by a devastating blast that
claimed the lives of 19 personnel. Internal documents leaked
to NewsNet indicate that Mitsuhama was studying a nakhlite,
one of the rare Martian meteorites known to have fallen to
Earth. This particular nakhlite was part of a shower that rained
down on an Egyptian village in 1911. It was likely created
when a large meteor impact struck the surface of Mars, eject-
ing pieces of the planet into space that eventually found their
way to Earth. The cause of the explosion remains unknown, as
is the fate of the meteorite. < Posted 01-10-63>

3. Spirit Squat Evicted
COLOGNE (DMK)-A squat eviction turned surreal
Tuesday when the resident artist collective turned out to be a
nest of free spirits. Knight Errant officers raided the highly pub-
licized squat near the Cologne Cathedral at 2 am, at the tail end
of an exhibition opening of "alien art." The squat was seized
only a few days earlier by a quirky artist's collective called
Exquisite Corpse who announced the exhibit as a response to
the "stifling alienating of corporate consumer culture." Knight
Errant expected some resistance from the squatters and their
anarchist supporters, but was surprised when the artists turned
out to be spirits in metahuman form. Several officers were hos-
pitalized after being overwhelmed by "crippling laughter" and
other magical effects, before an emergency unit of magicians
drove the spirits from the scene. < Posted 03-07-63>
. The Knight Errant mages weren't able to banish these spir-
its, they just forced them to leave. Rumor is that these spirits
are still circulating in the Cologne shadows and are looking
for a new way to "shake up the mundanes."

4. Swamp Static
ANTWERP (DMK)-A Shjawase meteorological station
confirmed reports of seismic activity yesterday, registering
several localized earthquakes in uninhabited areas of the north-
ern United Netherlands. The largest disturbance reached 6.2 on
the Richter scale. Witnesses also reported a number of unusual
phenomena at the same time, including lightning storms, tor-
nados and a drastic increase in airborne static electricity. Three
members of a geological survey team were seriously injured
when the swamp water they were wading in was electrified,
while reports that two aircraft crashed due to electrical mal-
functions are still being verified. < Posted 11-10-63>

5. Ghost City Sighted in Sahara Mountains
TAMANRASSET (UPI)-Tuareg nomads roaming in the
southern half of the Sahara Desert have reported sightings of
an ancient city in the highlands of the Tassili n' Ahaggar,
approximately 400 kilometers southwest of Tamanrasset.
Overhead satellite imagery scans have revealed no traces of
the city, however many experts believe that it may be a form
of "astral construct." The Desert Wars operations staff has post-
ed requests for explorers to form expeditions to investigate the
city. With the second half of the 2063 Desert Wars season start-
ing in a few weeks, concerns are being raised that the city
might cause some magical interference with battles in the
Mountain Quadrant. < Posted 08-19-63>

Li?ka Jesenica (MS)-MediaSim has asked EuroPol for aid

plants and animals residing among the enigmatic cluster of
lakes and forests. MediaSim believes Dinaric militias may have

8. "Flatline Killer" Arrested
SANTA FE (NABS)-Pueblo Security announced today that
they had captured the "Flatline Killer" and charged him with
twelve counts of murder. Dylan Risius, a 21-year old ork, was
arrested after what police called a "pitched magical battle."
Risius was not registered as a magician, and authorities believe
his magical talent was previously undiagnosed. Risius is
charged with incapacitating his victims with electrical surges
and hooking them up to the Matrix before anchoring stasis
spells onto them. Authorities believe Risius then used some
sort of illegal biofeedback program to kill his victims. Risius
admitted to the killings, claiming that spirits within the Matrix
ordered him to bring them sacrifices or they would disable the
grids. < Posted 05-09-63>
. The interesting thing is that police haven't located any sort of
black IC program in Risius's possession, and there's evidence
that his victim's took days to die. To make it weirder, while
there's evidence that Risius made virtual contact with many of
his victims, there's nothing to show that he actually made phys-
ical contact with any of them. So the question is, how did he
disable them with magic, force them to stay jacked in and
then kill them without any sort of utility? Weird, eh?

10. Frankenstein Returns?
BENSHEIM (DMK) Reports of strange lights in the moun-
tains and vandalism in local graveyards have many residents
in the southern Darmstadt and Bensheim districts wondering
if the Frankenstein legend is actually true. Police have
increased local patrolling, and members of the Dr. Faustus
Society have been called in from Frankfurt to investigate.
During the seventeenth century, a local alchemist named
Konrad Dippel took residence in one of the local castles, the
Burg Frankenstein, and was accused of robbing graveyards for
alchemical ingredients. English novelist Mary Shelley learned of
the legend while visiting Darmstadt and used it as the basis for
the horror novel Frankenstein. Currently the University of
Heidelberg maintains the castle under trust. < Posted 09-12-63>
· Not again. Every few years the Ancient Wisdom channel
shows that Hour of the Magi rerun about the novel, and a few
dozen newbies come rushing over from North America to
Darmstadt to see if they can find anything new. Never mind
that magic professors from Heidelberg have stripped clean
the entire castle.
· Struwwelpeter
. It's different this time. There haven't been many of those dread-
ful Americans around, and lately the Bergstraße region has seen

been far south of the Frankenstein castle, closer to Bensheim and
Alsbach. There are many other mountainside castles in the area
besides Frankenstein, so it's possible one of them (like Auerbach
Castle) may be the actual epicenter of activity.

the shadows. One thing can send shockwaves rippling
through the status quo, creating situations where people in

of the situation, protect their interests or get back in the
game. Here's a recap on the top ten news items of rele-
vance to shadowrunners over this past year.
· Captain Chaos
1. Polish Resistance Routs Counteroffensive
WROCLAW (AP)-The Polish Liberation Army announced
the defeat of a combined Polish nationalist and Russian coun-
teroffensive driving for the rebel capital of Wroclaw. The com-
bined forces launched the counteroffensive in late July, fol-
lowing reports of sinking morale and a loss in confidence of
the leadership of General Marszalik. Shortly after the coun-
teroffensive begun, however, a Russian command and com-
munications failure led to artillery and air strikes against their
own units. Taking advantage of the stalled drive, rebel forces
launched a flanking attack that routed the nationalist and
Russian troops. < Posted 08-01-63>
· One for the history books, all right. Though the vaunted
Summer Offensive petered out, Marszalik was ready for this
attack. Rebel commandos-funded by S-K Prime, no matter
what they say-infiltrated the Red Army's command and
control nexus at Poznan, deep within nationalist territory.
They pulled a flawless job, not only stealing the battle plans
from the Russkies' isolated system, but also inserting camou-
flaged knowbots and viral packages to seed chaos and
keep the Red Army deckers busy.
The result? A total rout. The Russkies ended up firing on
themselves. Meanwhile, the AW volunteers were waiting for
them in hardened positions, serving as anvil to the Hussaria's
flanking attack hammer. Plans are already cooking for a new
offensive in January 2064.

CHEYENNE (NABS)-The Tsimshian government slammed
the door on private discussions with the Salish-Shidhe, hosted
by the Sovereign Tribal Council. After months of virulent press

Joshua Proudtree resigned. Despite eight months of work, he
failed even to end the regular border skirmishes and covert
operations by both sides. < Posted 10-08-63>

3. Editorial: Novatech in Financial Trouble?
WASHINGTON POST-Do a series of events over the
past weekend in Kentucky indicate that Novatech is in far
worse shape than previously thought?
A copy of First Kentucky President Steve Darby's per-
sonal calendar, leaked by an internal source, indicates that
Darby met with Novatech Executive Vice President
Henderson Gustav Friday afternoon. They were to discuss a
pending 500 million nuyen loan agreement that First
Kentucky had promised months ago but not yet delivered.
The following Monday morning, employees and customers
arrived at First Kentucky to find the doors locked, lights off.
Darby's notes indicate that he was well aware that the
bank was approaching insolvency and did not have the money
to loan to Novatech. Why he met at all with Gustav regarding
a loan that First Kentucky was unable to make is unclear.
Monday morning, Northwest Financial filed suit against
Novatech in UCAS federal court for defaulting on a billion
nuyen corporate loan. Sources indicate that this is only one of
several notes that indicate Novatech is currently in default.
<Posted 07-12-63>
. That's right, chummers. Novatech is hemorrhaging nuyen
like you wouldn't believe. Scuttlebutt says that Villiers and the
upper ranks have a big surprise planned, but if Novatech
doesn't get back in its game soon, it won't have the funds to
stave off litigation attacks, much less do anything else.
· Corp Watcher
. Novatech ain't just sitting idle while its arch-nemesis Mr.
Dankwalther tears away chunks. It's made some strange
moves over the past year, elther acquiring or undermining
odd corps that normally wouldn't even be a blip on their
radar. I'm betting that these were forays to either block or
investigate the activities of our good Mr. Dankwalther.

4. Juan Carlos Rescinds Claim to Spanish Throne
MADRID (SOL)-In the midst of raging controversy, Prince
Juan Carlos stunned his supporters yesterday by relinquishing
his claim to the Spanish throne. This paves the way for Alfonso,
former King Felipe's illegitimate ogre son, to take the crown. A
coronation ceremony is already scheduled for January, though
Juan Carlos's supporters have vowed their opposition. No

5. Shakeup in Portland
PORTLAND (AP)-After months of infighting, civil
unrest and political bickering it seems that the Tir Tairngire
Council of Princes is finally at full strength again, though the
situation in the country seems far from stable. The problems
started over a year ago when the motion to grant the coun-
cil seat vacated by Prince Oakforest to James Telestrian III
was contested. Jenna Ni'Fairra disagreed with the High
Prince's choice and advanced another candidate, Feana
Sterling, for the position. This forced an open debate on the
council over the matter.
While this struggle played out, Ehran the Scribe stepped
down from his seat, leaving a second spot vacant on the
council. With Ehran gone, Ni'Fairra had the votes to get
Sterling a seat, and a compromise was reached where
Telestrian took the other.
Sterling's stint on the council was short lived, however, as
she was assassinated by a Rinelle supported terrorist three days
after being officially named a prince. This action touched off
riots and a brutal suppression of dissidents personally led by

rumors about Ares ships geeting sunk in the Sea of Japan? It's
all part of some corp conflict going on between Ares and
Proteus. The whole matter was apparently dragged in front of

but another day of biz for the megacorps. Meanwhile, how

7. Yamatetsu Mars Mission Lands
SVOBODNIY (ITAR-TASS)-Cosmonauts from the
Valentina Tereshkova sent back live footage from the surface of
Mars to mission control at the Svobodniy launch facility today.
The Tereshkova-a joint project between Yamatetsu, Russia
and the Pacific Prosperity Group-is the first manned mission
in history to land on the red planet. The Tereshkova launched
from Yamatetsu's Shibanokuji orbital yard in February and
reached Mars after a six-month journey. The team will remain
on Mars until January 2064, to be back in Earth orbit around
June. < Posted 09-16-63>
· Before you even ask-no, they didn't send any pictures of
Martian dragons or pyramids. So far. (Unless Yamatetsu's
keeping them hush-hush, that is.) The astral observations of
their Awakened specialist, on the other hand, are a hot topic
among experts worldwide.
· Spiderjack
. Too bad it isn't actually the first manned mission to Mars-or
even the second. NASA's Operation Discovery made it there first.
· MUFON Boy
. You're talking about that alleged secret NASA Operation
Discovery mission aren't you? That's just myth, like Area 51. In
any case, the world thinks Yamatetsu made it first, which is a
big boost to their space program, especially after losing the
probe race to Ares.

8. Arcology Handed Over To Metroplex Guard
SEATTLE (NN)-Major General Angela Colloton, comman-
der of Joint Task Force: Seattle, announced yesterday that stew-
ardship of the Renraku Arcology was being handed over to the
Seattle Metroplex Guard. UCAS and Renraku Red Samurai
forces finished their relief efforts earlier this year, securing the
arcology from any remaining or future terrorist threats. Though
quiet on the matter for many months, Renraku America is
preparing a "Schultz-Aneki Community Project" proposal to
the Seattle Council next month. < Posted 08-30-63>
. Renraku America didn't have the money to reclaim the
building alone, and the UCAS is holding on to the arc until
they can settle on Renraku's bill. Sherman Huang, Manager
of Renraku America, is hoping the new proposal will make it
seem like he's resolved the situation-just in time for
Renraku's upcoming shareholders' meeting that should elect
a new board and maybe a new CEO.
· Renraku Fox
. Despite their claims, the arc isn't fully recovered. They still
have a few "contained" problem spots, and now the Guard

9. Night of Liberation Declared
MANILA (AP)-Rioting continued for the fourth straight day
as protesters attempted to storm the military facility at Subic Bay
and were fired upon by troops. There are unconfirmed reports
that a dracoform, possibly the great dragon Masaru, appeared in
the sky over Manila yesterday evening during a pitched street
battle between protesters and corporate troops.
As the situation in the Philippines stretches on, it also
seems as though corporate troops already on the island may
have to wait a while longer for reinforcements. Two MCT cruis-
ers wandered into the midst of joint Ares and Yamatetsu naval
maneuvers and sustained significant damage due to incidental
fire. Both Ares and Yamatetsu have issued formal apologies for
the incident and have promised to keep their troops free from
any fighting on the islands to avoid any further incidents.
<Posted 09-27-63>
. Ha ha ha. So it looks like Masaru's little revolution got kicked
into high gear. Ares and Yamatetsu may be keeping all their uni-
formed people in their compounds, but the streets are crawling
with "new recruits" to the revolution. Not to mention that rumor
of a Knight Errant FireWatch team undertaking some "training
exercises" at an undisclosed location in the South Pacific.
· Hangfire
· Masaru-or someone-better get the situation under con-
trol soon or it'll get past the point of no return. A lot of
refugees that came over when Yomi shut down have been
using the riots to settle old scores. There are at least three
Yakashima compounds that have been totally fragged since
the rioting started.

with the boy Emperor in the past two weeks. Maybe they're
hammering out a peace solution.

10. General Secretary Absent From Sickness
MOSCOW (ITAR-TASS)-A spokeswoman for the office of
the General Secretary acknowledged yesterday that Arkady
Korolenko, General Secretary of the National Supreme Soviet,
has taken a leave of absence due to illness. Spokeswoman
Valeri Kiropovna would not provide specific details, but she
emphasized that Korlenko is expected to recover, though no
specific date was given for when he would return to an active
schedule. Korlenko's failure to appear at recent public events
had raised concern that the leader of the Russian state may
have to step down due to failing health. < Posted 11-24-63>
· Spin doctoring, chummers. Korolenko's not just sick, he's
dying. And not just "recently"-he's been suffering from liver
cancer the past nine months. Valeri made the announce-
ment only to stall the inevitable power struggle before
Korolenko has a chance to anoint a successor. He could go
at any moment, if what I hear is true.
· Bogatyr
. That would explain why he looked so bad at the May Day
speech. I've heard he's already handpicked his successor:
General Dzhermiya Ogurznev, chief political officer for Russian
forces in Poland. Apparently Korolenko's waiting for Ogurznev to
finish his tour in Poland before making the announcement.
· Stormavik
. Of course if things keep going the way they have been in
Poland, then Ogurznev may be out of a job real soon.

THE ROAD TO AMAZONIA 2064

Urban brawl might be flashier and combat biking more
acrobatic, but soccer remains the world's most popular sport.
Few things can combine such passion, talent and beauty.
· And money, especially money.
· Goalkeeper
Every four years, the world paralyzes for a month as 32
countries vie for glory in FIFA's World Cup. Next year will see
its return to a land that is synonymous with soccer:
Amazonia. After decades of relative isolation, the country is
starting to open up to tourism and investment. The tourna-
ment will be the crowning achievement of Amazonia's thir-
tieth anniversary, an event that will draw global attention.
· This championship is just a giant-sized PR tool for the wiz-
worms. All they want is to shake off their reputation as war-
mongering eco-terrorists and improve foreign relations.
· Centurion
· A slave can always use his master's weapons against him.

Amazonia '64 will also be a historic milestone for FIFA,
as it will become the first World Cup open to both genders.
While this is the norm in the South American colossus,
thanks to long-standing laws against discrimination, not
everyone is thrilled about it. The event has drawn protests
from less-enlightened countries, but FIFA has already stated
that from now on all international tournaments will be
mixed, something they hope will benefit the sport.

FOR THE NUYEN OF THE GAME
Amazonia '64 is already an economic success. Most
tickets have been sold in advance, tourism is skyrocketing
and stores can't keep up with the demand for merchandise.
The sale of broadcasting rights alone has left record sums in
the government's coffers.
· Sol Media's execs are aflame over the broadcasting rights.
They thought they had bagged them, until GloboTrid got the
nod from Hualpa.
· The Keynesian Kid
· Well, what did you expect? GloboTrid has always put a pos-
Itive spin on Amazonian news-just remember all the hype
about Alcantara after the Probe Race. They're probably col-
lecting their paycheck.
· Bira
. GloboTrid isn't the only regional outfit to benefit from the
tournament. The Amazonian government was pretty generous
with the small fish, leaving only the scraps for the big boys.
· Bandeirante
Amazonia has invested heavily in infrastructure, with the
Novo Maracanã stadium being the most prominent example.
The stadium is a testament to Amazonian engineering, with
high tech alloys and organic materials interwoven for amazing
results. With half a million seats, Novo Maracanã is the biggest
stadium in the world, o mais grande do mundo.
. That monster is awe-inspiring, especially when full (not an
uncommon occurrence, given Metropole's size). I can't even
imagine how it looks like from the astral.
· Brother Data
. Consider yourself lucky, chummer. It's completely inebriat-

The World Cup is also fertile ground for player scouts
and corporate sponsors from all over the world, looking to
spot the newest and hottest talents. No one forgets that
Barcelona snatched Justin Estrada in 2060 for a mere million
nuyen, a real bargain considering the Pueblo superstar is
now worth a cool 120 million.

THE AMAZONIAN MARVEL
He is considered the best player of all time, a living legend. To some, this son of Rio's slums rep-
resents the Amazonian dream of a better tomorrow. To others, he is Sergio Da Matta, captain of the
Amazonian national team. To his fans, he's simply Maravilha: the Marvel.
Tina Duarte: So how does it feel being the world's greatest player?
Maravilha: < laughs Well it feels great! Really, other than the NERPS! sponsoring, I'm just a
normal guy who enjoys normal things.
TD: You know, when I was a teenager I dreamed of meeting you. You're an idol for most peo-
ple in this country, as a matter of fact. Isn't it a heavy responsibility?
Maravilha: Yes, of course it is. You're carrying the people's hopes every time you enter the field,
and you know you can't let them down. That's what encourages us when we play a tournament like this.
TD: Now that we're at it, whom do you think is going to win?
Maravilha: Who's gonna win? Amazonia, naturally!
TD: OK, so what's your pick for second place?
Maravilha: Tough call. We lost the title against the Germans in 2060 and I'd love to get it back
from them, but Argentina and Pueblo have very strong teams too.
TD: Anyone else?
Maravilha: I think ... no, only those three. The other teams are good, but not that good.
TD: One more question. Some people find it hard to believe that you're still playing at 52. What
makes you go on?
Maravilha: Tina, you know that I spent my childhood in the favelas. Being an elf wasn't easy
then, and I was lucky to survive that time. Gang wars, drugs, hunger and poverty ... those things are
gone now. We're a new nation, with a whole new destiny awaiting us. I want to see it happen, while
doing what I love most.
. Oh come on! Couldn't we get something less biased? This looks like a

paid for it

accordingly.
· Abrojo
. The Amazonians like to think the cartels are gone, when in fact they own the
favelas. No one says that loud, of course, because everyone in the slums deals
with them. In Maravilha's particular case, this allowed him to climb to the top
by removing younger, better players who threatened him. Like my brother.

FIVE RINGS, FIVE SECTORS:
DENVER 2072
by Timothy Hayes, UCAS Today
With the IOC making its final decision
in mid-2064, bid cities are scrambling to
gain critical support ahead of the vote to
choose the host city for the 2074 Winter
Olympics. The race has become awfully
hot, especially with a last minute bid from
the Treaty City.
The biggest buzz is Denver's bid, which
was presented by Ghostwalker himself at a
star-studded press conference. The proposal
is fully endorsed by the CAS, NAN and UCAS
governments, all of whom have touted it as
a great step towards improving North
American relations. Many corporations have
also thrown in their lot and the city stands to
reap huge benefits.
Other bids like Tir Tairngire are also
doing their best to court the IOC, as the
Olympics would certainly create a tourist
boom that could revive the country's econ-
omy. While Portland suffered some set-
backs, like major riots early this year, the
city enjoys enough international support to
make it a contender.
. That's because the princes are threaten-
ing to drag certain skeletons out of other
people's closets.
· Danis
Meanwhile, Yamatetsu's controversial
bid has been endorsed by Russia, Hong
Kong, Chile and several Asian countries.
The Pacific Prosperity Group has also
stamped its seal of approval all over
Vladivostok, which could give Yamatetsu a
huge economic leverage in the vote. The
corporation wants to achieve corporate his-
tory-but it will have to wait until the IOC
decides if it's a valid entry.
· Yamatetsu has gone so far as to promise
zero-g sports at Shibanokuji, but that does-
n't seem to have impressed the IOC. Not
after they learned about several malfunc-
tions last month.

The NAHL is still shaky and not everyone joined it to

GAME INFORMATION
Culture Shock is intended to help you bring your game
to life by adding some vivid cultural elements. It also intro-
duces a number of plot hooks as well as moving existing sto-
rylines forward. Aside from flavor and a developing world
background, the best way to use this chapter is to pick one
of the references and build an adventure off of it. Some addi-
tional suggestions for using this material are included below.
ORXPLOITATION
Is it a turning point in mainstream culture or a colorful fad?
Will goblin rockers reclaim their cultural initiative, massacre
each other in turf wars or sell out to the soulless media
machine? Will Or'zet musicians bring public pressure to bear
on Saito's policies? Are the Vory carving out an empire for
themselves, or will they step on other syndicates' toes and stir
a mob war? Is Malenkin actually going semi-legit, or is Chimera
backing the Vory and CrimeTime? And what about Humanis's
plans? Whatever the answers are, orxploitation remains a phe-
nomenon that has visibly impacted society, though commer-
cial interests and petty conflicts have tarnished it.
A character might want to join the fad, but there are
other ways to involve runners: they could be hired to find
out what happened to Robert Page, protect a novahot music
star, rescue a contact's daughter from a prostitution ring or
help the Vory fight off Brackhaven's zealots. Last but not
least, runners can also learn Or'zet.
Or'zet Language Skill
Characters can learn Or'zet just as they would learn any
other language, but Or'zet is still incomplete and therefore
difficult to learn. On top of this, ork youth and musicians are
already twisting the tongue to fit their own slang needs, so
the language is already changing as it spreads and gains
mainstream acceptance.
State of the Art: 2064
167

Page 159:
NOVATECH
In terms of skill improvement Karma costs, treat Or'zet
as an Active skill (see p. 245, SR3). If using the Optional
Training Rules (pp. 48-51, SRComp), the base target number
for purposes of reducing training time is equal to the new
skill rating being trained for plus 4. Characters may also
default to Intelligence per standard rules. Or'zet linguasofts
are limited to Rating 3.
Additionally, only orks and trolls are able to speak
Or'zet correctly. Other metahumans lack the jaw structure
and tusks required for a correct pronunciation, so they apply
a +2 target number modifier when speaking Or'zet.
Characters may have tusks implanted and their jaws surgi-
cally altered to avoid this modifier, but they may suffer social
penalties due to their odd appearance.
Gamemasters should make sure that the learning
process becomes an interesting experience for the charac-
ters. Instead of hiring a boring professor in Seattle, a runner
could find herself tracking down a fugitive Orkland
Community Center researcher in California. Once in San
Francisco, she would have to convince him that she's not a
Protectorate agent, probably by working against Saito's
regime.
CORP VOGUE
The intricacies of corporate jingoism fall under the
province of various corporate Knowledge skills. A character
with the Knowledge skill of Mitsuhama 4, for example, has a
good chance of knowing what fashions are favored by MCT
employees, as well as what sort of reward systems MCT
offers to its citizens. The Etiquette (Corporate) skill reflects
knowledge of how to behave in corporate social situations,
which includes what type of clothing to wear, how to
address people and similar corp social customs.
Gamemasters can use this information to help players
get a clear sense of what they are dealing with when they
run against the corps. A limited form of nationalism exists in
every megacorp. The majority of the lifers working for the
corp believe in what they're working for, or at least pretend
to if someone is looking. This also extends to any corporate
contacts the characters might have. If the runners are not
sensitive to the corporate mindset, they risk pissing a valu-
able contact off (unless the contact is jaded, cynical, open-
minded or simply antagonistic towards their patron corp).
Bratpacks
Corporate gangs can be used in any public situation
where nationalistic corpers may play a role. Some gangs are
little more than a collection of corp-minded careerists who
will stand up for their corp's name and image, especially if
provoked by an antagonistic opponent or outsider. Other
corp gangers really take their corporate identity to heart,
showing off tattoos, logos and corp colors and starting trou-
ble with rival bratpacks or non-corpers. Mostly they'll stick to
verbal harassment or basic brawling. A few bratpacks have
transformed into actual criminal elements, actively creating
trouble for people outside their corps as well as engaging in
illegal activities like smuggling, chip-dealing, vandalism,
running prostitution rings and even robbery or protection
rackets. Corp gangs will usually back away from seasoned
shadowrunners but will are unlikely to give ground to citi-
zens of a rival corporation.

Hooks
Here are some corp vogue adventure hooks to get you
started:
A corporation needs to know if their new executive is com-
patible with the company philosophy. They hire runners to
make contact with the executive and form a friendship. If the
runners can convince the executive to give them confidential
information about the corporation within a two-week time
frame, they will receive twice the amount that they were
hired for. It also means the end of the new exec, who will be
killed if the runners achieve their goal.
Kelis Samuels made a mistake. He didn't think anyone would
find out about his weekend rendezvous with the girl from
Yamatetsu. Dating outside of the corp has hurt his personal
rating, possibly blowing his chance at a job with acquisitions.
He decides to earn some quick points. His weekender let
slip that a Yamatetsu bratpack was planning to break into
one of his corp's housing enclaves and stir up trouble. If he
can find out what they're planning and stop it, his little
weekend tryst might be forgiven. He hires runners to follow
up on the information.
