Characters must perform the Cook and Installation tasks for the
component from scratch, using the new software rating and size.
For example, a decker has an MPCP-6 deck with Hardening4. The Hardening software is 144 Mp in size. If the decker
upgrades the Hardening to 5, the new size is 180 Mp-a 36 Mp
upgrade. After performing programming equivalent to a 36 Mp
program, the decker performs the Cook and Installation tasks,
These are based solely on MPCP-6 and Hardening-5, as if the
component were being built from scratch.

OPTIONAL RULE: SALVAGE
Gamemasters may allow deckers to "salvage" 50 percent of
the value of parts they replace In upgrades. This represents
Income from selling outdated OCCs, old memory chips, reusing
circuit logies, and so on.
MPCP
As noted in previous sections, no persona program on a
deck may have a rating higher than the deck's MPCP rating.
Additionally, the combined ratings of a deck's persona programs
may not exceed the MPCP Rating multiplied by 3.
In addition, no utility may have a rating higher than the
MPCP Rating. However, the MPCP Rating does not limit the number of utilities the deck may run at any single time. That limit is
purely a function of the deck's active memory size and the size
of the utilities (see below).
MPCP UPGRADES
Improvements In the holographic code links under Matrix
2.0 have eliminated the older, more rigorous requirements that
controlled MPCP upgrades: Characters no longer need to
upgrade persona programs to match new MPCP Ratings.
However, whenever a character upgrades his deck's MPCP.
he also must upgrade components that have construction tasks
that Involve the MPCP. These components Include the ASIST
Interface, the ICCM filter, and Response Increase. Until the decker upgrades these components to match the new MPCP Rating.
he cannot run his deck with both the new MPCP and the old
components. He may run the deck with the older, lower MPCP
Rating and continue to use the components, or he may run with
his new, higher MPCP rating but without the components.
REALITY FILTERS
Reality filters Impose a metaphor on the Matrix chosen by
the decker and programmed into his deck's MPCP. A decker who
likes baseball can model an entire Matrix run on a hard-fought
game. A decker with a taste for swashbuckling can swagger his
way through the world of a cybernetic musketeer or duelist.
In practical terms. a reality filter acts as an additional level of
Response Increase on the cyberdeck. It Increases Reaction by 2
and adds + ID6 to Initiative, However, a reality filter also Increases the MPCP's design rating by 2. This increase affects design
size and all base times, target numbers, and so on, based on the
MPCP's Rating, though the real size of the program is not
increased. Reality filters also reduce MPCP Ratings by 1. As a
result, deckers may have to reduce their persona programs to
keep them within acceptable limits (see MPCP).
The decker may operate his deck without turning on the
reality filter. In that case, he does not receive the Response
Increase or the rating reduction.
Turning a reality filter on and off is a Free Action. However,
until the beginning of the next Combat Turn after toggling the filter on or off, reduce the decker's current Initiative by half and
apply a +2 modifier to all his target numbers.
MPCP ICONOGRAPHY
Instead of jamming the entire Matrix through reality filters,
deckers also may adapt their icon's appearance, or iconography, to
fit the metaphors they are likely to encounter on a sculpted system.
An MPCP program can be cooked with alterations to the
Iconography If the decker has the source code, The programming changes only take a few hours to write and do not require
a test, but the Cook Task requires the standard task period and
components.
The decker can then simply pop the new chip Into the
deck's motherboard-no Installation Task is required.
Deckers may maintain a library of MPCP chips, each
designed to present an image that blends with a specific system
iconography, and thus avoid the penalties for violating the
metaphor of a sculpted system.

ACTIVE MEMORY
Active memory is the cyberdeck's "RAM," to use the oldtech term. Just as hackers in the twentieth century talked about
having 64 meg of memory on their computers, a Sixth World
decker refers to 100 Mp of active memory on his deck.
A deck's active memory limits the utility programs the deck
can run and have ready for use by the persona at any one time.
A deck with 100 Mp of active memory can run no more than 100
Mp of utilities at any one time.

ASIST INTERFACE
The ASIST interface component controls the simsense experience of cyberspace and the decker's DNI (direct neural interface) connection to the Matrix, as routed through the interpreta.
tive software coded into the MPCP. The interface also has a con
trol program of its own to handle the data exchange.
This ain't no home sim entertainment unit. The typical signal
strength on a full-bore cyberdeck is not too far below the brainkicking current a wirehead gets from a BTL chip. That gives the
decker the best interface to the Matrix, and when a deck is running ar that intensity, it is sometimes called a "hot" deck.
However, a decker can deliberately reduce the intensity of
the ASIST signal, down to about the level of legal simsense. This
is called a "cool" deck. Cool decks can reduce the persona's
speed in cyberspace, but black IC cannot inflict lethal damage
over a cool Interface, Lethal black IC acts as non-lethal black IC
through a cool deck. Psychotropic black IC, however, works over
both levels of interface.
A decker can install hot or cool ASIST circuitry, If he installs
the hot circuit, he can selectively switch from hot to cool, or viceversa, at will, However, switching Interface circuitry while under
attack by black IC requires the same tests as jacking out. A cool
interface can only run cool. Either ASIST Interface can be
switched off entirely, which turns the deck into a "tortoise" (see
Tortoises).
Whenever a decker upgrades his deck's MPCP, he must also
upgrade the ASIST interface, Until he does so, the deck acts like
a tortoise if he runs with the new. higher MPCP, but the interface
works as designed if operated with the MPCP at the old value.
CONTROL INTERFACES
A hot deck can be run without any manual control surfaces.
All commands are transmitted via DNI This enables a decker to
cool down the deck during a run, but acts as another level of
Response Increase, adding 2 to Reaction and + ID6 to Initiative.
A deck equipped with a keyboard and a hot ASIST Interface
can be run hot, cool, or even tortoise-cold.
Running a deck cool, by using a keyboard and other manual controls to augment the ASIST interface, reduces a decker's
Initiative by 1D6.
RAS OVERRIDE
ASIST circuitry Includes a reticular-activation system override (RAS). The RAS override suppresses sensory signals from the
decker's meat body, freeing him to concentrate fully on the simsense experience of the Matrix. The RAS override also louses up
any physical coordination the decker has, so apply a +8 modifier to target numbers for any Physical Tests à decker must make
while jacked in. In addition, concentrating on the physical world
louses up a decker's Initiative badly (see Cybercombat, p. 120).
Disconnecting the RAS override dilutes the ASIST interface
so badly that the cyberdeck acts like a "tortoise.".
TORTOISES
Tortoises are cyberdecks without ASIST Interfaces. They use
VR goggles, holo-display screens or even flatscreens, gloves,
trackballs, and other low-end tools to simulate the Matrix experience without a DNI connection. A deck without an RAS override is equally inferior. Characters can build tortoises easily and
cheaply, because cost of the VR equipment is a trivial component
of the MPCP price,
Deckers can always switch off their decks' ASIST Interface
circuitries and turn their decks into tortoises. If under attack by
black IC, this counts as "Jacking out" and requires the same tests
to succeed (see Black IC in Combat, p. 47, in Intrusion
Countermeasures).
Tortoises reduce the user's Reaction by half. rounding down,
to a minimum value of 1. They can be equipped with Response
Increase, but users only receive the additional 1D6 for Initiative.

ICCM BIOFEEDBACK FILTER
Intrusion counter-countermeasures (ICCM) technology protects
deckers from the worst effects of black IC. New generation ICCM
technology allows ICCM devices to be built directly into cyberdecks,
An ICCM filter increases the decker's chances of jacking out
successfully when under attack by black IC. Apply a -2 modifier
to the target number for the Willpower (IC Rating) Test (see Black
IC In Combat. p. 47. in Intrusion Countermeasures).
The filter also allows a decker to make two separate Damage
Resistance Tests against lethal and non-lethal black IC-one test
with Body and one with Willpower. The player may choose the
test with the best result to use as the character's resistance.
Karma Pool dice added to the test are rolled separately and augment the chosen Resistance Test. Hacking Pool dice cannot be
used for these tests.
The ICCM filter is not effective against the psychological
effects of psychotropic IC. However, It does buffer the decker
from the physical side effects of sparky IC programs (see Gray IC,
p. 43 in Intrusion Countermeasures), the same as it does
against black IC.
Constructing an ICCM filter requires Computer B/R and
Biotech skills. The Success Tests for the Cook and Installation
Tasks use the average of these skills, though two characters may
Instead work as a team to perform the tasks, each contributing
one of the two skills.

1/0 SPEED
The input and output of a deck is analogous to the old
modems that connected terminals and computers back in the
dark ages of computing. The I/O speed indicates the maximum
1/O bandwidth that a decker can allocate to a task.
A standard cyberterminal, whether legal or a deck, automatically and always can handle its icon bandwidth as a function
of its MPCP, so the I/O speed feature only comes into play when
using the optional bandwidth rule (see Bandwidth, p. 90), If the
optional bandwidth rule is not in effect, all uploads and downloads are always at the full I/O speed of a deck.

V/O speed must be built in multiples of 10. The maximum
bandwidth value of a deck is equal to the deck's Sensor Rating x
MPCP Rating x 10 Mp.

RESPONSE INCREASE
Response Increase is the Matrix equivalent of wired reflexes. Each point of Response Increase increases a persona's
Reaction attribute by 2 and Initiative by + ID6.
A deck can support only 3 points of Response Increase,
Furthermore, Response Increase cannot exceed a deck's MPCP
Rating divided by 4, rounding fractions down (so a deck with MPCP
Rating 3 or below cannot sustain any level of Response Increase).
In addition to the deck's 3 points of Response Increase, deckers may gain an additional point of Response Increase by using a
reality filter. Furthermore, deckers running hot decks on pure DNI
control may gain an additional point of Response Increase. The
absolute maximum of Response Increase a deck may have is 5
points, which translates as + 10 to Reaction and 6D6 for Initiative!
Response Increase requires both programming and hardware
construction. The programming task is based on an effective rating
equal to the MPCP, with a multiplier equal to the Response
Increase Rating multiplied by 2. For example, on an MPCP-6 deck,
the software component of Response Increase-2 would require
programming a 62 x 4 routine, a design size of 144 Mp. (See
Programs, p. 100, for information on programming tasks.)
This design size also affects the cost of the task, because the
decker must use an OCC large enough to hold the Response program.

SATLINK INTERFACE
A satlink interface consists of a cyberdeck-mounted protocolconversion logic and a satellite dish. High-density fiber-optic cable
with built-in signal boosters connects the deck to the dish. The signal boosters enable a decker to run a signal through several kilometers of this cable without using an external signal booster. Any
dish formar may be used with a deck fitted with an interface.
A standard satellite dish is one-half meter across and weighs
five kilograms. Large portable dishes are one meter across and
weigh eight kilograms: they reduce by 1 the target number for
tests to locate satellites (see Satellite Links, p. 30), Fixed-base
earth stations reduce target numbers by 2. Mobile fixed-base
earth stations require trucks and trailers.
Characters Inclined toward a do-it-yourself philosophy may
also fashion temporary satellite dishes out of spray polymer and
plastic webbing. These dishes can be assembled and mounted
almost anywhere, but they only last for a few hours. The electronics for a temporary dish weigh 3 kilograms and can be
reused, The electronic components pack down into a box about
50 centimeters by 25 centimeters by 25 centimeters.

Storage memory is analogous to the hard drives on old-time
computers. Any program in a deck's storage memory can be

utilities a decker plans to use during a run must be kept in storage memory. Data for uploads and downloads can be kept in
Storage Memory, or the cheaper off-line storage.

MISCELLANEOUS COMPONENTS
Certain fixed-price deck components, such as casing. hitcher jacks and vidscreens, act the same whether they are hooked
up to an icepicked CyberShak cheapy that some high-school
hacker is using to fix his grades or the finest product of the
Fairlight labs.
A deck's casing protects it from the daily bump and grind of
a shadowrunner's life. If a deck is exposed to physical damage,
It has an effective Bod of 1. The cost of casing is negligible when
compared to the cost of other deck components. If someone
wants to buy a bunch of empty casings, figure they're worth 10
nuyen apiece. Prices for other basic components appear in the
Component Prices Table.

DECKS À LA CARTE
In Matrix 2.0. deckers can order decks from manufacturers,
who assemble them using components specified by the decker.
The Deck Component Prices Table provides formulas for calculatIng the prices of these components. Each formula represents the
entire cost of the component, including software, hardware, circultry, installation-the whole nine meters. Slot your stick and
the deckmeister puts this in your deck, ready to run.
The formulas are derived from the cost of the component's
software, chips, circuitry, and so on given in the task description.
Components with software feature a Program Factor (PF), the
multiplier in the price formula for software. The PF is determined
according to a specific rating of the deck, called the PF basis. For
example, the P'F basis for a deck's Hardening is the deck's MPCP
Rating. The Program Factors Table shows PFs for various ratings.
For example, a MPCP-8 deck has a PF of 500 nuyen for its
hardening program formula.

PACKAGE DISCOUNTS
Generally, deckers receive a 10-percent discount when
ordering a complete deck (MPCP, persona chips, and ASIST interface, plus optional components and features).
After a particularly lucrative run, SuzyQ decides to treat herself to
a new cyberdeck. She orders an MPCP-8/6/6/6/6 deck with Response
Increase-2, 480 MePS of 1/0 speed, Hardening-4, as ICCM filter, 1,000
Mp of active memory, 1,500 Mp of storage memory, and a hot ASIST

OPTIONAL RULE: BREADBOARDING
All the base numbers for deck construction assume that the
manufacturer or decker is building a standard portable
cyberdeck-a laptop, In twentieth-century terminology. But
cyberdecks can be breadboarded-built larger, faster, and cheaper with whacked out desktop-sized components and external
black boxes to handle special functions.
Breadboarded CPUs, which contain an MPCI, personaware,
Response, Hardening and I/O speed-weigh 10 kilograms. All
other breadboarded components weigh 2 kilograms more than
the standard component. A complete breadboarded deck is
about the size of a twentieth century desktop computer.
When using breadboard construction, reduce the target
numbers for the Cook and Installation tasks by 2 and reduce the
cost of parts by 50 percent. The same discount applies to à la
carte deck building. Breadboard components are not compatible
with standard decks.
On the other hand, breadboarded and standard decks run
the same software, and programs developed for a breadboarded
deck can be cooked into OCCs for a regular deck at any time-a
program is a program. By the same token, the same utilities run
on both standard and breadboarded decks.
CZ decks cannot be breadboarded. You can never find a hat
that fits
OPTIONAL RULE: COMMERCIAL CONVERSIONS
Under Matrix 1.0, deckers purchased legal cyberterminals at
street prices that reflected the initial steps of deck conversion:)
stealthing the MPCP signature, expanding the motherboard to
accommodate the Evasion and Masking chips, and so on. They
retained the commercial circuitry for features such as Hardening
and I/O speed and added modules for Response Increase. The
Matrix 1.0 rules reflected a parasitic decker subculture that
adapted the tools of a host culture-legitimate computer
usage-to its own ends.
Matrix 2.0 rules reflect significant advances in the capabilities of illegal programmers and deckmeisters and illegal Matrix
technology. Even commercial machines such as the remarkable
Fairlight Excalibur lag well behind the SOTA today. As a result.
most deckers under Matrix 2.0 assemble their own decks or purchase decks customized to their ownspecifications.
Deckmeisters are the most common source of customized decks,
but a few manufacturers produce such machines as well. (See the
archetype for the Deckmeister, p. 92. for further information.)
OPTIONAL RULE: BANDWIDTH
Bandwidth is the speed at which data moves over a connection. Old-tech acoustical modems measured bandwidth in
"baud," or bits per second. A 2.400 baud modem could send of
receive 2,400 bits every second. With modern optical tech,
bandwidth is measured in MePS: megapulses per second.
Two kinds of bandwidth exist under Matrix 2.0 rules: icon
bandwidth and I/O bandwidth. Icon bandwidth carries commands and sensory data to and from the deck. I/O bandwidth is
used to transfer data. Both types of bandwidth affect the size of
a decker's datatrail, which in turn affects how easily trace IC programs can locate a decker (see Jackpoints, p. 14 in Grids and
Hosts, and Trace Factor, p. 45 in Intrusion Countermeasures,
for information on using the optional bandwidth rule).
The gamemaster can use one or both forms of bandwidth in
his game. The optional icon bandwidth rule is simple, while the
I/O bandwidth rule is more complex, If the group chooses not to
use the optional bandwidth rules, assume that any grid connection operates at virtually instantaneous speeds. The I/O speed of
cyberdecks determines data-transfer rates, per the Shadowrun,
Second Edition Matrix rules

ICON BANDWIDTH
Icon bandwidth handles all the commands and ASIST signals
between the cyberdeck and the Matrix. Icon bandwidth is equal
to the sum of the decker's persona program ratings and the ratings of all the utilities he has loaded into his deck's active memory. A deck's MPCP. utility options such as the stealth option.
and options that reduce memory size, such as the optimization
option, do not affect the icon bandwidth.
A decker must set his icon bandwidth at the beginning of a
Matrix run. The bandwidth remains constant throughout the
run-the decker cannot change its size without disconnecting
and starting a new run (see Suspending Icon Operations, for
the sole exception to this rule). If something destroys or reduces
the decker's program ratings, the icon bandwidth may be reasSigned, but it cannot be reduced to make his datatrail harder to
trace.
Before jacking in, deckers may reduce their icon bandwidths
by reducing their persona ratings lower than their actual ratings.
Any reduced ratings must remain at their reduced levels for the
rest of the run.
Deckers may not reduce the ratings of their utilities-utility
programs do not work at anything less than their full ratings.
Note that the actual size of the utilities in memory has no effect
on Icon bandwidth,
Sidewinder has an MPCP-6/5/3/4/4 deck. She has not reduced any
of her persona ratings to slim down her icon bandwidth, and so her
persona code has a bandwidth of 5 + 3 + 4 + 4-or 16 MePS.
Sidewinder also loaded Sleaze-5, Deception-4, Attack-6, and
Analyze-4 into her deck's active memory. That adds another 19 MePS
to the bandwidth, for a total of 35 MePS.
Sidewinder decides she wants to load another 5 Mp of utility code
for the run, which increases her icon bandwidth to 40.
I/O BANDWIDTH
V/O bandwidth handles uploads and downloads. A deck
with an I/O bandwidth of 10 MePS can upload or download 10
Mp of data per second. or 1.000 Mp of data in 100 seconds.
Deckers may change their deck's I/O bandwidths at any time by
performing Retrain operations.
Deckers may increase their deck's I/O bandwidths by reassigning MePS from their icon bandwidths. but the decker must
suspend his icon operations while doing so (see Suspending
Icon Operations).
Data Transmission
On a 20 MePS Matrix connection, downloading a 1.000 Mp
file takes 50 seconds. fast enough for legal users, but potentially lethal for a decker trying to stay one jump ahead of black IC.
The same thing applies for deckers trying to upload doctored
datafiles or booby-trapped application programs.
To avoid such risky situations, most deckers keep their
bandwidths as small as possible. At the last possible moment,
they perform Retrain operations to their bandwidths, grab the
paydata, and drop the extra MePS as soon as they're done. High
bandwidth when the decker doesn't need it can be disastrous if
a trace IC program picks up his datatrail,
Utility Loads
Swap Memory operations enable deckers to load new
copies of utility programs onto their decks. This may be quite
convenient when changing the mix of utility programs on a deck
or replacing degraded or crashed utilities, The speed of a Swap
Memory operation depends on a deck's I/O bandwidth (see
System Operations, p. 117, for detalls),
Multiplexing
Multiplexing enables a decker to upload multiple utilities or
upload and download files or programs simultaneously. To multiplex, the decker divides his I/O bandwidth MePSs among different jobs any way he likes. For example, a decker with 100
MePS of I/O bandwidth could download files at a rate of 25
MePS and upload utility programs at a rate of 75 MePS.
Multiplexing is a Free Action and requires no tests.
Retraming
Retraining refers to the process of changing I/O bandwidth
during a Matrix run by using a Retrain operation. (See System
Operations, p. 117, for further information.)
Suspending Icon Operations
Deckers may re-assign their icon bandwidths to I/O bandwidth by suspending their icon. However, icon bandwidth MePS
cannot be divided-the entire icon bandwidth must be reassigned. A decker with an icon bandwidth of 35 MePS, for
example, couldi re-assign 35 MeP'S to his I/O bandwidth, but not
15 MePS. Suspending Icon operations are Free Actions.
All persona ratings-MPCP. Bod, Evasion, Masking and
Sensor-drop to I when icon operations are suspended. No
matter how jazzed up the cyberdeck's Response Increases may
be, the decker gets only ID6 for Initiative. The decker also loses
extra initiative dice from reality filters and DNI controls. Lastly, all
utility program ratings are reduced by half (round fractions
down).
To restore the reduced ratings to their original values, the
decker must reallocate the bandwidth back to its original purpose, which is another Free Action, However, the ratings do not
return to their original values until the decker's next available
action. For example, if a decker suspends icon operations and is
attacked by IC, he can release the I/O bandwidth at any time but
will have to fight off the IC with reduced persona and utility ratings, and an Initiative based on those reduced values, until his
next action. This is a very dangerous proposition,

THE DECK SHOP
You won't find the deck shop at a shopping mall. No neolux
sign outside proclaiming "Highly Illegal Cyberdecks Sold Here."
The deck shop may be a backroom operation behind a legit
front, or an enterprise hidden behind samurai on retainer, muscle-for-hire from the local organized crime outfit, or another.
equally deadly force. All part of the overhead, chummer,
Inside, the deck shop may be a devil rat's nest of
components, coding workstations, chip cookers and raw
optical crystals all spilling over benches and shelving. Or
the shop may be a complex that makes anyone else's
clean-and-neat look like nouveau pigsty, Personal style
rules in this field and competence counts more than
housekeeping
No matter how it's arranged, the equipment adds up to a microtronics facility
worth 300.000 nuyen, If the deckmeister has been in business any length of
time, the deck shop contains a couple of
meganuyen worth of raw chips, logic
circuits, and auxiliary components like
bioscanners and ASIST interfaces. He
keeps local computing power with a few
gigapulses or so of addressable memory
on tap, with a workstation or a development mainframe for the real top-line
coders. Chips and miniCDs with meg
after meg of source code are filed
according to some organizational
scheme-maybe neatly. maybe in
some chaotic fashion that only the
deckmeister can unravel.
Kids used to grow up dreaming
about Santa's workshop. This is what
deckers dream of when visions of
sugar plums dance through their
heads, even if the elves here are likely to be heavily armed and prone to
mocking wordplay in Sperethiel.
Oh, and don't even think about
making a run on the place. The
thought of all that gear might be
tempting. but anyone who hits a
deck shop draws the wrath of the
shop's deckmeister and his muscle,
not to mention every decker who
depends on the shop. Drek, you
might as well sign over your cred to
the Universal Brotherhood and send
Lone Star a resumé of your runsyou'll die more quickly.

Deckers use a wide variety of different types of programs. Persona programs define the
decker's online icon. Utility programs help him carry out system operations or serve as tools for
specific actions, Command set programs Instruct computers to perform specific jobs.
This section defines the various types of programs and provides rules for creating, or pro
gramming. them. The programming process applies to the creation of any type of program
from the deadliest attack utility to a simple spreadsheet.
Note that the rules presented in this section do not apply to persona and deck programs,
Rules for these programs appear in Cyberdecks. p. 81.

SOURCE AND OBJECT CODE
A source program, also called source code, is the original form
of a program. All source programs are written in programming languages intelligible to humans. Common programming languages
in the Sixth World Include HoloLISP. InterMod, MATCom, and
Oblong. These languages use different combinations of verbal or
written Input and dynamic icon manipulation to combine code
icons in virtual reality to literally construct programs,
After a programmer has written the source form of a program, he can translate it Into an object format. Object format is
the actual "machine language," a series of linked holographic
constructs that constitute executable programs in Matrix technology. Object code is what is loaded into memory when a utility runs or is cooked into an OCC.
A decker must have the source code of a program to
upgrade or modify the program. Object-code copies of programs cannot be used to change a program.
UTILITIES
Theoretically, a sufficiently godlike decker could command the
Matrix with nothing but his bare persona and skill alone. Less divine
netheads, however, must supplement their puny skills with utility
programs, Utilities come in four varieties: operational, special, offensive, and defensive. Operational utilities apply to a decker's System
Tests. These prove especially useful when performing system operations. hence the name operational utilities. Special utilities perform
specific tasks in the Matrix. Offensive utilities are used to damage
opposing deckers, IC programs, and so on. Defensive utilities are
designed to prevent or reduce damage taken in cybercombat.
The multiplier value listed in each utility entry is used in software tasks (see Cyberdecks, p. 81) and programming (see
Program Size. p. 101). Each listing also notes any system operations for which the utility may be used (see System Operations,
p. 108, for descriptions and rules for system operations), Some
utility descriptions also list options that may be used with the
utility (see Optional Rule: Utility Options, p. 102. for descriptions and rules for utility options).
Unless otherwise noted, utility programs must be preloaded
into both active memory and the decker's online icon to work.
OPERATIONAL UTILITIES
Operational utilities help deckers execute system operations,
in the same way that a samurai's smartlink makes his gun a more
effective tool and his dermal armor backs up his armored jacket.
Operational utilities reduce the target numbers of a decker's
System Tests by the utility rating (see System Tests, p. 19 in
Matrix 2.0), Deckers may perform system operations without utilities (see System Operations, p. 108)-not having the right program does not make the operation impossible, just more difficult.
All operational utilities may use the DINAB, one-shot, optimization, and squeeze options.
Analyze
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Analyze IC, Analyze Icon. Analyze
Security, Locate IC
The analyze utility reduces the target numbers for System
Tests that identify IC, programs, and other resources or events
controlled by a host.
Browse
Multiplier: 1
System Operations: Locate Access Node, Locate File,
Locate Slave
The browse utility reduces the target numbers of Index Tests
made to locate specific data values or system addresses. Unlike
analyze and scanner utilities, which search for Matrix activity, the
browse utility works on the contents, or real-world functions, of
these data nodes.
Commhink
Multiplier: |
System Operations: Retrain, Tap Comcall
The commlink utility reduces the target numbers of any tests
that affect the decker's communications link,
Crash
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Crash Application, Crash Host
The crash utility does just what its name states; reduces the
target numbers for deckers' attempts to crash an application or
host.
Defuse
Multiplier: 2
The defuse utility reduces the target numbers of System
Tests made to defuse data bombs (see Data Bombs, p. 41).
Deception
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Graceful Logoff, Logon to (LTG, RTG, or Host)
Unless otherwise noted, the deception utility may be used
to reduce the target number of all Access Tests.
Decrypt
Multiplier: 1
System Operations: Decrypt Access, Decrypt File, Decrypt
Slave
The decrypt utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to defeat scramble IC programs.
Bisinfect
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Disinfect
The disinfect utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to destroy worm viruses.

Evaluate
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Locate Paydata
The evaluate utility sifts through large data samples to find
valuable loot. However, the utility degrades rapidly as market
demands change. The gamemaster rolls ID6 - 2, (round fractions up) at the end of each run. The ratings of all evaluate programs degrade by the die roll result. This loss of effectiveness
occurs whether the decker is currently in play or not.
Deckers with source copies of evaluate utilities can upgrade
them per standard rules (see Upgrading, p. 83) or spend Karma
Points to restore them-I Karma Point restores | Rating Point to
the evaluate utility. This expenditure represents time spent programming stock market analyses, rumors, news stories, shadowtalk, and other data into the evaluate program.
Mirrors
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Decoy
The Mirrors utility reduces the decker's target number for
System Tests used in the Decoy operation.
Read/Write
Multiplier: 2
System Operations: Download Data, Edit File, Upload Data
The read/write utility reduces the decker's target number for
System Tests necessary for the operations listed, and also for any
other System Tests that may be needed when accessing, editing,
or loading/creating data in the Matrix.
Relocate
Multiplier: 2
The relocate utility reduces the target numbers of the special tests made to defeat trace IC programs that have begun their
location cycles. (See Trace IC. p. 45. for further Information.)
Scanner
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Locate Decker, Locate Frame
The scanner utility reduces the target numbers of System
Tests made during operations that search for deckers, frames, or
their effects.
Spoof
Multiplier: 3
System Operations: Command Slave, Edit Slave, Monitor Slave
The spoof utility reduces the target numbers for all System
Tests made to affect system and subsystem slaves.
Validate
Multiplier: 4
System Operations: Dump Log, Validate Passcode
The validate utility reduces the target numbers of any
System Tests made to implement administrative changes or read
administrative logs.
SPECIAL UTILITIES
Special utilities perform specific jobs. They cannot be programmed on the fly-if the decker does not have the program
pre-loaded. he cannot use it.
Compressor
Multiplier: 2
The compressor utility reduces the size of data being
uploaded or downloaded by 50 percent. The maximum file size
that the compressor utility can handle is Rating x 100 Mp. A 100
Mp file would be compressed to 50 Mp. halving the time it takes
to upload or download.
Decks must have enough active memory to accommodate
the decompressed size of a compressed utility being uploaded.
If the deck does not have adequate active memory. it cannot
perform the Swap Memory operation. For example, uploading a
compressed 100 Mp utility requires 100 Mp of free active memory, even though the program is crunched down to 50 Mp for
the upload.
Decompressing a file or program on the Matrix requires a
Complex Action. Compressed files and programs must be
decompressed before they can be read or used.
Sleaze
Multiplier: 3
The sleaze utility combines with a deck's Masking Rating to
enhance the deck's Detection Factor: (Masking + Sleaze) + 2.
round up.
Track
Multiplier: 8
The least reverent of the current publications focusing on the
Matrix describes the track utility as "trace IC for deckers." Most
sources attribute its development to a Renraku programmer who
decompiled Lone Star's beagle utility (see the Lone Star sourcebook, p. 123). When the programmer's team produced an openended search algorithm that put the original beagle design to
shame, a junior engineer on the staff disappeared into the shadows with the source code. Within weeks, track utility programs
began showing up in the catalog files for Hacker Heaven and
other hot software sources,
In game play, the track utility is used as a combat program
against hostile deckers. After each successful attack, note the number of successes the attacking decker scored, The target decker
must make an Evasion (Track Rating) Test. If the Evasion Test fails
to yield an equal or greater number of successes, the attacker's
track utility locks onto the target decker's datatrail and begins its
location cycle, similar to trace IC (see Trace IC, p. 45). Divide 10
by the attacker's net successes to determine how many turns the
track utility needs to locate the target decker's jackpoint.
The target decker can try to escape the attacking decker by
logging off or jacking out. However, the track utility makes logoff operations more difficult and may trace a jacked-out decker
in the same way as trace IC.

Targeted deckers can use the relocate utility against track
programs as against any trace program (see Relocate It. p. 46,
in Intrusion Countermeasures): When doing so. the targeted
decker makes his test against the attacking decker's Sensor
Rating instead of the system's Control Rating, If the relocate utility succeeds, the track program fails completely. The attacker
must successfully attack the target decker again before using the
track utility against his opponent.
Of course, the target decker can always crash the attacking
persona, which would stop all its pesky programs,
OFFENSIVE UTILITIES
Offensive utilities inflict damage on the icons of deckers, IC
programs, running programs, datafiles-pretty much anything.
Some offensive utilities, such as the attack utility, are general, bruteforce destructive logics. Others are subtler and more limited.
A decker can program the attack utility on the fly (see
Cybercombat. p. 123) but cannot program any of the other
offensive utilities during a run.
The following descriptions specify the targets each utility
program can attack.
Attack
Multiplier
Light: 2
· Medium: 3
Serious: 4
Deadly: 5
Target: Deckers, frames. IC, SKs (see Artificial
intelligences. p. 138)
Options: Area, chaser. DINAB, limit, one-shot, optimization, penetration, stealth, targeting
The attack utility. the least subtle offensive program, can be
programmed to inflict Light to Deadly damage. It samples the
instruction algorithms of the targeted icons and tries to Introduce
fairly coarse memory faults Into the icon's most frequently
accessed code segments, In cybercombat, that translates to a
direct attack on the Condition Monitor of the decker or IC icon.
The attack utility affects online icons only and has no effect
on a decker's meatbody or cyberdeck.
Black Hammer
Multiplier: 20
Target: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
Two years ago it was a rumor, last year a bleeding-edge
weapon on the decks of Lone Star's GridSec elites. This year the
so-called black hammer utility is cropping up in shadowy hands.
The black hammer utility is a black IC program that targets
the decker, not the deck. It can kill a decker without knocking his
cyberdeck off-line, so that the decker's jackpoint remains traceable. Black hammer lacks the blaster-like capabilities of mainframe-driven black IC, but otherwise its effects are identical to
those of lethal black IC (see Black IC, p. 47 in Intrusion
Countermeasures).
The maximum rating for the black hammer utility is half the
programmer's Computer Skill, rounded up. The program can be
Installed in a semi-autonomous knowbot (SK) (see Artificial
Intelligences, p. 140), but not in a frame.
Hog
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
Hog is a virus weapon used by deckers against other deckers. It Introduces simple, self-replicating code into the target
cyberdeck. The self-replicating code occupies the deck's active
memory and crashes running utilities.
Whenever an attacker makes a successful attack using a hog
program. the target makes an MPCP (Hog Rating) Test.
(Hardening reduces the target number for this test.) If the attacker wins the test, the hog utility reduces the rating of the highestrated program running on the targeted deck by I point for every
2 net successes the attacker achieved. The hog utility continues
to drain the same number of rating points at the end of every
subsequent Combat Turn until it has crashed the program. Then
the hog program repeats the process with the next highest-rated
program on the targeted deck. The hog program continues this
process until it has crashed every program on the targeted deck.
Programs Infected with the hog virus operate at their
reduced ratings until the hog virus crashes them completely.
A decker may purge a hog virus from an Infected deck by
spending a Complex Action and making a successful Computer
(Hog Rating - Hardening) Test. Increase the target number by the
original rating of the infected program. A single success on the
test wipes both the hog virus and the infected program from the
deck's active memory. A hog virus cannot be purged without
purging the infected program.
Deckers can use the Swap Memory operation to reload programs crashed by a hog virus or purged in the course of elimlnating the virus.
Hilljoy
Multiplier: 10
Target: Deckers
Options: One-shot, optimization, targeting
The killjoy utility mimics non-lethal black IC, Killjoy programs inflict Stun damage to a decker's meatbody. Otherwise,
the killjoy utility is identical to the black hammer utility. The maximum program rating for a killjoy utility is half the programmer's
Computer Skill, rounded up.
Poison
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The poison utility attacks the Boct Rating of targeted personas
and behaves like acid IC. If the decker successfully attacks his target.
the target makes a Bod (Poison Rating) Test. Reduce the target's Bod
Rating by 1 for every 2 net successes the attacker achieved.

Restrict
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area. DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The restrict utility attacks the Evasion Rating of targeted personas. If the decker successfully attacks his target, record his successes. The target makes an Evasion (Restrict Rating) Test,
Reduce the target's Evasion Rating by I for every 2 net successes the attacker achieved.
Reveal
Multiplier: 3
Target: Deckers, Frames, SKs
Options: Area, DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The reveal program attacks the Masking Rating of targeted
personas. The target makes a Masking (Reveal Rating) Test.
Reduce the target's Masking Rating by 1 for every 2 net successes the attacker achieved.
Slow
Multiplier: 4
Target: IC
Options: Area. DINAB, one-shot. optimization, targeting
The slow utility reduces the execution speed of proactive IC.
Whenever a decker hits IC with the slow utility, make an
opposed Resistance (Slow Rating) Test for the targeted IC program. If the IC test generates more successes, nothing happens
to it. If the slow Attack Test achieves more successes, the IC
loses 1 action for every 2 net successes the IC achieved, If the IC
has no actions left in a turn, it hangs-goes dead.
Note that temporarily disabling IC in this manner prevents
the IC from raising the decker's security tally. However, suppressing the IC requires I point of Masking (see Suppressing IC,
p. 40 in Intrusion Countermeasures), If the IC is not suppressed
at the beginning of the next Combat Turn, the gamemaster rolls
Initiative for the IC per standard rules and the IC resumes where
it left off.
Reactive IC is not vulnerable to the slow utility, Trace IC Is
only vulnerable to the slow utility during the hunting cycle,
Steamroller
Multiplier: 3
Target: Tar Baby, Tar Pits
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization, targeting
The steamroller utility is a specific type of attack program
that Inflicts (Rating)D damage to tar IC programs. The steamroller
program is immune to the destructive effect of tar programs
(hence the name "steamroller"-it flattens tar). Crashing tar IC
programs with the steamroller utility increases the decker's secutity tally unless the steamroller program is equipped with the
stealth option or the decker suppresses the IC per standard rules.
DEFENSIVE UTILITIES
Defensive utilities are designed to prevent, reduce, or repair
damage taken in cybercombat. Defensive utilities cannot be programmed on the fly. As with offensive utilities, add or subtract
the utility rating as indicated in the individual descriptions
Armor
Multiplier: 3
Options: Optimization
The armor utility reduces the Power of damage inflicted on a
decker's icon by the Armor Rating. For example, the armor utility
reduces all damage caused by killer IC or the attack utility, But against
black IC, it reduces only damage taken by the decker's icon-not
damage taken by the decker's meatboy, In short, the armor utility is
always effective against standard damage to the icon's condition
monitor but has no effect on collateral damage to the decker or his
deck, which must depend on Hardening for protection.
The armor utility loses | Rating Point every time the decker
takes damage-every time it fails to completely absorb damage
from a hit. Deckers can replace degraded armor utilities with fresh
copies of the program by performing the Swap Memory operation.
Camo
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The camo utility rating is added to the trace factor, which
impedes the attempts of trace IC to follow a deck's datatrail (see
Trace IC, p. 45. for more details). Additionally, the utility acts as
an operational utility for the Redirect Datatrail operation (see
System Operations, p. 117),
Cloak
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The cloak utility reduces the target numbers for Evasion
Tests made during combat maneuvers (see Combat Maneuvers,
p. 121 in Cybercombat),
Lock-On
Multiplier: 3
Options: One-shot, optimization
The lock-on utility reduces the target numbers for opposed
Sensor Tests made during combat maneuvers (see Combat
Maneuvers, p. 121 in Cybercombat),
Medic
Multiplier: 4
Options: DINAB, optimization
The medic utility is used to reduce the number of filled-in
boxes in the online icon's Condition Monitor. To use the utility, a
decker must spend a Complex Action and make a Success Test
using a number of dice equal to the medic utility rating. The target number is determined by the level of damage the icon has
suffered, as shown on the Medic Target Numbers Table.

Each success achieved on the Success Test repairs I wound
on the Icon's Condition Monitor. The program loses | Rating
Point each time it is used, whether it scores any successes or not.
Deckers may load a new copy of the medic utility and restore it
to its full rating by performing a Swap Memory operation.

Restore
Multiplier: 3
Options: DINAB, one-shot, optimization
The restore utility repairs damage to online icon attributes.
However, the program cannot repair permanent damage to the
actual persona chips caused by gray or black IC
To use the restore utility, the decker makes a Restore Test against
a target number equal to the rating of the program that caused the
damage If the icon has suffered damage from different programs,
such as Acid-4 and Poison-6 IC programs, use the higher rating.
The utility repairs | point of damage for every 2 successes
achieved on the Restore Test.
Shield
Multiplier: 4
Options: Optimization
Shield enables a decker to parry attacks in cybercombat
Whenever an attack affects the decker's persona, the decker may
make a Shield Test against a target number equal to the skill of
the attacker-Computer Skill for a decker, the system's Security
Value for IC programs, the DINAB value for a frame, and so on
Reduce the attacker's net successes by the number of successes
achieved on the Shield Test.
The shield utility is also effective as a defense against crip
pler and ripper IC attacks and any other attack In which the targeted decker makes an opposed test, In these cases, the decker
makes a Shield Test and applies any successes from that test to
his successes on the opposed test
A shield utility loses | Rating Point every time it is used,
whether the Shield Test succeeds or not. Deckers may load fresh
copies of the utility by performing Swap Memory operations.
PROGRAMMING
All programming jobs are tasks, with specific base times
task periods, and tests needed to complete the work (see
Deckers and Tasks, p. 77, in Deckers).
The base time required to write a program equals the size
of the program multiplied by 2. The result is the base time

the program size any size increases from program options.
To determine the task period for the job, make a Computer

expressed in days. The Program Rating used in the Computer
Test is the actual rating of the program. Do not include changes
in the rating due to options.
PROGRAM RATINGS
The ratings of a deck's MPCP and frame cores may not exceed
the programmer's skill rating multiplied by 1.5. (The programmer
may use the Computer Skill, or Its Software concentration or
Matrix Programming specialization for programming.) The ratings
of all other programs may not exceed the skill rating itself.
PROGRAM SIZE
Determine a program's size by squaring its rating and multiplying the result by the program multiplier supplied in the program description. The Program Size Table provides precalculated
sizes for programs of Ratings 1 through 14 and multipliers up to
10 (all program sizes are shown in megapulses), The table should
cover everything within reason, For unreasonable programs,
gamemasters must perform their own calculations. If modifiers of
some kind reduce the effective rating of a program below 1, use a
Rating of I to determine design time and memory requirements.
To find the size of a program on the table, find the program's rating in the Program Rating column along the left side of
the table. Then read across to the correct Multiplier column. A
Rating 4 program with a multiplier of 6. for example, has a size
of 96 Mp.
PROGRAMMING TOOLS
The minimum setup needed for programming is a personal
computer with memory equal to or greater than the size of the
program being created. Personal computers cost 20 nuyen per
Mp of memory. Miniature decks cost more (see p. 259. SRII), IF
the personal computer has double the required memory, it confers a + 1 task bonus (see Deckers and Tasks, p. 77, for further
Information on task bonuses),
The programmer can install a basic programming tool sulte in
his personal computer as well. The tool suite, called a programming
"kit." confers another - I task bonus and costs 1,500 nuyen.
A more elaborate programming package called a programming "shop" confers a +2 task bonus. A programming shop
costs 15,000 nuyen and doubles the memory In the personal
computer. If a decker has already doubled the memory on his
personal computer, installing a programming shop effectively
quadruples the computer's memory and provides a +3 task
bonus (+1 for doubled memory, +2 for shop).
Using a mainframe host instead of a personal computer confers a +4 bonus to programming tasks. However, the mainframe's Security Value must be at least half the rating of the program being created. Determine the cost of one day of programming time on a mainframe by multiplying the mainframe's
Security Value by 100 nuyen, Companies that sell machine time
actually set up virtual machines with the necessary ratings and
have very active security, These companies do not hesitate to
revoke the passcodes of any customer who messes with the system's security or tries to break out into native mode. Purchasing
a mainframe is out of the question for most deckers, but for the
more ambitious programmers, determine the purchase cost of a
mainframe by multiplying the mainframe's Security Value by
5.000.000 nuyen.

A programming suite installed in a mainframe adds a + 1 task
bonus to the mainframe host bonus. Programming time on a mainframe that carries a programming suite is quite expensive, however. Determine the cost of one day of programming time by multiplying the mainframe's Security Value by 200 nuyen. Purchasing
a mainframe programming suite costs 300.000 nuyen-and of
course, the suite is useless without a mainframe to run it on.
Note that standard programming tool suites and shops can
be used only on personal computers. Mainframe programming
suites can only be used on mainframe hosts
Deckers may also "steal" programming time on a host. To
do so, the decker must perform a successful Validate Passcode
operation and plant a counterfeit passcode in the host, The decker may then use the host until the host system administrators
notice the funky code and delete it. Of course, system operators
may also send their own deckers or heavy IC programs after the
offending programmer as well.

Selena needs to upgrade her offensive capabilities ia the Matrix.
She has a Computer Skill 8, and so she decides to write her own copy
of Attack-8S. First, she determines the size of the new program. The
rating on the new program is 8 and the Attack-S multiplier is 4, so the
equation looks like this: 82 x 4 = 256 Mp.
Next, she calculates the base time for the programming task: 256
x 2 = 512 days. To determine the task period, Selena makes a
Computer Test against a Target Number 8, the same value as the program rating. Her test yields 2 successes, and she buys 2 more with
Karma Points, for a total of 4 successes. She then divides the base
time, 512, by 4, which gives her a task period of 128 days.
Selena has only limited funds available, so she buys herself a personal computer with 256 Mp of memory at a cost of 5,120 nuyen (256
x 20) and gets to work. She works on the program for 10 days, reduc.
ing the task period to 118 days, then takes a break for a few weeks
to pay the rent with a shadowrun.
With her cut of the take from the run, Selena drops another 5,120
nuyen to upgrade her PC to 512 Mp of memory. That's twice the memory she needs for the programming task, and so she receives a +1
task bonus. As a result, her next 10 days of work count as 20, reducing the task period to 98 days.
Unexpectedly, Selena comes into a bit more money, and so she
buys a programming kit for 1,500 nuyen. The kit provides another +1
task bonus. Combined with the bonus from the memory upgrade, that
produces a +2 task bonus. As a result, Selena's next 5 days of work
count as 15, reducing the task period to 83 days.
On her next run, Selena haggles with Mr. Johnson and gets 15 days
of programming time on a mainframe in lieu of a cash payment. (The
mainframe has a Security Value of 4, so it's adequate for creating the
Attack-8S program.) Mainframe access confers a +4 bonus, so her 15
days of work on the mainframe count as 75.
With only 8 days left in the task period, Selena returns to her personal computer. The PC provides a +2 bonus with its doubled memory,
and so she completes the programming task in 3 days.
Programming Teams
Characters may also work together in teams to produce pro
grams. The maximum size of a team equals half the Computer
Skill rating, rounded down, of the team member with the highest Computer Skill. The maximum rating of programs the team
may produce equals 1 plus the Computer Skill rating of the team
member with the highest Computer Skill. For example. a player
with a Computer Skill of 8 may form a programming team with
3 other players, and, if his is the highest skill in the group, the
team may produce programs with Rating 9 programs,
For the Computer Skill Test made to determine the task period, average the skills of the team members, rounding up, For
example, a team of three programmers, with skills of 6, 7, and 6
respectively, would make the test with an effective Skill Rating of 7.
The team cannot share tools and task bonuses. Each team
member must have the minimum required computing resources
to work on the program. Without task bonuses, each day of world
by the team reduces the task period by I day. To apply task
bonuses, add all the bonuses the team members possess and
reduce that total by the number of programmers on the team.
The result is the team's task bonus. For example, a team of 3
characters with task bonuses of +3, +2, and +3, would have a +5
group task bonus. Each day the team works on its program
reduces the task period by 6 days.
OPTIONAL RULE: UTILITY OPTIONS
Utility options are modifications that alter the basic operation of utilities. Generally. an option enhances a program's performance in one way but limits Its performance in some other.
Options dramatically Increase the complexity of the Matrix
rules. The interaction of options and programs can become quite
intricate, and so gamemasters and players should become thoroughly familiar with the standard Matrix rules before introducing
utility options into their games. As always, gamemasters may
modify the options rules to best fit their games
Gamemasters may also introduce only specific utility
options into their games, However gamemasters should keep
utility and IC options balanced. Many of the utility options are
designed to counter specific IC options (see Intrusion
Countermeasures, p. 50), and allowing IC options without providing deckers with the means to combat them may produce
unbalanced and unsatisfying game play;

OPTIONS AND SIZE
Under the standard Matrix rules, program size is fixed. The
size that governs the base time to write the program is the size
that the program occupies on a cyberdeck.
When using utility options, programs have two separate
sizes. The actual size measures the space the program occupies
on a cyberdeck. The design size is used to determine the programming base time for the program,
Options may change the size of a utility program in one of
two ways. First, adding an option to a program may alter the
program's rating, thus altering its real size. Or an option may
increase a program's size by a percentage of its original size. In
certain cases, an option may reduce the actual size of the program but increase the design size because it requires hyper-efficient code
When layering multiple options on a single program, apply
any changes to the program's rating before calculating any percentage changes in its size. For example, If a set of combined
options add +2 and +3 modifiers to the program's rating and a
50-percent increase in its design size, apply the rating modifiers
first. Calculate the program size based on the new rating and
then apply the percentage increase. Cumulative percentage
changes are applied sequentially. For example, if a 180 Mp program receives two 50-percent size reductions, first reduce the
180 Mp to 90 Mp. Then reduce the 90 Mp to 45 Mp.
OPTIONS AND RATINGS
Changes in the effective rating due to options do not count
against the maximum rating that a programmer can design. For
example, a programmer with a Computer Skill 8 can design any
utility with a Rating of 8, even if options raise its effective rating
for programming purposes.
Changes in the rating due to options also do not affect the
target number for the programming task. A Slow-4 utility with an
Area-4 option would have a Target Number of 4. not 8.
The maximum rating for options that themselves have ratings, such as the area option, is the base rating of the program.
A Slow-4 program can have no more than Area-4, even if the
programmer's skill is higher.
OPTIONS AND COST
The price of a program depends on its base rating and
design size, For example, an Attack-6M program. without
options has a Base Rating of 6 and a design size of 108 Mp. The
program's street price equals its size, 108 Mp, multiplied by
200: 108 × 200 = 21,600 nuyen.
An Attack-6M(Skulk-4) program has an Effective Rating of
10 and a design size of 300 Mp. for a price of 60,000 nuyen.
AREA
Rating Modifier: +Area Rating
The area option enables a utility to engage multiple targets
on the host. The utility may engage a number of targets equal to
the area option rating. The decker makes one Attack Test and
applies the result to all specified targets. Increase the target
number for each target by the total number of targets.
For example, two corp deckers, A and B. are engaging an
intruder on a green host. The Target Number against legitimate
Icons on a Green system is 4. But decker A maneuvered successfully to dodge an attack already and scored 2 extra successes, and so the target number against him receives a +2 modifier,
which raises it to 6.
The intruder engages the two corp deckers using an attack
program fitted with the area option. Against decker A, the Target
Number is 8 (6 - 2 for attacking 2 targets). Against decker 8, the
Target Number is 6 (4 + 2 for attacking 2 targets).
The Intruder's Attack Test yields a 7. 8, and 7. Therefore, he
achieves | success against decker A and 3 successes against
decker B.
Note that the defensive utility armor protects against utillties fitted with the area option. Personas and IC programs carrying the armor utility add a +2 modifier to their effective Armor
Ratings when attacked with utilities bearing the area option.
CHASER
Rating Modifier: +1
The chaser option negates the +2 target-number penalty for
attacks against IC programs with the shift defensive utility, However,
the chaser option adds an additional +2 target-number penalty to
attacks against IC programs with the shield defensive utility,
The chaser and penetration options cannot be placed on the
same utility.
DINAB
Rating Modifier: +DINAB Rating
DINAB (pronounced die-nab or dee-in-a-bee in Matrix
slang) stands for "decker in a box." The DINAB option gives a
utility program a built-in Computer Skill, equal to the DINAB rating. On any of his actions, a decker may spend a Free Action and
the utility runs itself.
For example, if a decker has the analyze, mirrors, and
browse utilities all equipped with DINAB, he can spend a Free
Action and two Simple Actions to execute all three utilities, even
if each program is sent to perform an operation that requires a
Complex Action.
Utilities cannot run two operations in the same action. In
addition, the decker cannot use the program himself during any
phase when it is running under DINAB.
The DINAB option degrades-loses | Rating Point-every
time it fails a test, because opposing software can analyze the
failure pattern, find gaps in the expert system's decision tree and
exploit those gaps. For these purposes, a test is failed any time
the DINAB option is defeated in a System Test opposed by the
host/system. The DINAB option also degrades (per this definition
of failure) whenever it fails to hit a target in cybercombat or the
target reduces to zero all damage the DINAB inflicts.
Whenever a program or frame under DINAB control fails a
test with results of all 1's, the utility or frame crashes, The decker must reload a fresh copy before he can use it again. A Swap

Memory operation restores degraded DINAB options and
crashed DINAB-equipped programs and frames.
Frames can be equipped with DINAB, and smart frames
must have this option.
A decker can override the DINAB option on any of his programs or frames and use his own Computer Skill in its place. In
such cases, the decker must spend the type of action (Complex,
Simple, Free) normally required for using the program.
LIMIT
Rating Modifier: - 1
The limit option restricts the utility to a single type of target,
such as deckers. IC programs, frames, or SKs. The program is
useless against any other type of target.
Note that the limit option reduces the effective rating of the
program and thus reduces its actual size, as well. For example.
an Attack-6M (Limit: IC) program would have a Rating 5, and so
its size would be 52 x 3, rather than 62 x 3.
ONE-SHOT
Rating Modifier: Special
The one-shot option turns the utility into a single use program. After the utility executes once, it vanishes, To use the utility
again, the decker must reload it with a Swap Memory operation.
The one-shot option reduces the actual size of the utility by 75
percent, but it Increases the utility's design size by 50 percent.
A decker can carry multiple copies of one-shot programs in
his deck's active memory, but tar baby and tar pit IC programs
are extremely effective against that trick. Whenever a tar program trashes a utility carrying the one-shot option, it wipes out
all copies of the program in active memory.
OPTIMIZATION
Rating Modifier: Special
The optimization option reduces the actual size of a program by 50 percent and increases its design size by 100 percent.
PENETRATION
Rating Modifier: + 1
The penetration option defeats the shield defensive utility.
However, against IC programs with the shift defensive utility, a
penetration-equipped utility suffers a +2 target number penalty for
tests against the IC target. That penalty is in addition to the -2 target number penalty afforded by the shield defensive utility.
The penetration and chaser options cannot be placed on the
same utility
SENSITIVE
Rating Modifier: Special
The sensitive option renders programs effective on only one
manufacturer's mainframes. For example, utilities equipped with the
Mitsuhama sensitive option work fine on computers manufactured
by MCT but are useless on computers manufactured by anyone else
Writing sensitive-equipped programs requires In-depth
knowledge of the Matrix architecture of different computer systems. For the Computer Test required in the programming task,
use an average of the programmer's ratings in Computer Siil
and Computer Theory or its Matrix Theory concentration.
The sensitive option reduces a utility's actual size by 75 percent and increases its design size by 50 percent.
SKULH
Rating Modifier: +Stealth Rating
The skulk option enables a decker to eliminate or decrease
additions to his security tally prompted by crashing IC programs
(see Intrusion Countermeasures. p. 40). Whenever a decker
uses a skulk-equipped program to crash an IC program, reduce
the resulting security tally increase by the Skulk Rating
SQUEEZE
Rating Modifier: - 1
The squeeze option creates a self-compressed program. The
option reduces the utility's actual size by 50 percent for purposes of uploading, as if it had been uploaded under the
Compression utility, However, a squeezed program cannot be
used until the decker spends a Complex Action to decompress
It. Decompressing the program requires no test.
If a squeezed program is uploaded using the compression
option, it receives the benefits of both options. The program's.
size is reduced by 75 percent. However, the decker must
decompress the program twice-one Complex Action to undo
the Compression option's effects, and a second Complex Action
to undo the effects of the squeeze option.
The squeeze rating modifier affects the utility's design size
only, not its actual size. Decks must have enough free active
memory to accommodate the utility in its decompressed form.
TARGETING
Rating Modifier: +2
The targeting option provides a -2 target-number modifier
for attacks made with targeting-equipped combat utilities.
COMMAND SETS
A command set consists of a simple program of orders that
a decker can leave on a host to be executed at a later time
Writing a command set may require one or more Subsystem
Tests, depending on the tasks the decker wants the host to perform. For example, If the decker wants the host to manipulate a
remote device-such as opening a security door at a specific
time or after receiving a specific signal-he needs to make a successful Slave Test. If he wants the host to print something out of
erase a file. he must make a Files Test. If the decker wants the
host to open a SAN at a given time, he must make an Access
Test, and so on. The gamemaster determines the specific
Subsystem Test needed for the command set (when in doubt,
use a Control Test).
The deception utility reduces the target numbers for all
these tests (see Deception, p. 96).

More complex sequences of action require the decker to
write a program in advance and upload it. The design size of
such programs is ID6 x 20 Mp. After uploading the program,
the decker must make a successful Control Test to load the program into the host,
Total any successes the host scores in opposing these
Subsystem Tests. Divide the sum Into 24. The result is the number of hours the program will continue to run on the host without being detected and purged. If the host scores no successes,
the command set remains undetected for 48 hours.
FRAMES
Frames are combinations of decker-selected utilities, just as
constructs are combinations of IC programs. Frames may be
dumb or smart. Dumb frames are linked to the decker's persona
and only exist as long as the controlling decker remains active on
the host. Smart frames are capable of Independent existence in
the Matrix, whether their creator is logged on or not.
FRAME CORE
The frame core is the master control program for the frame.
Think of it as a box that holds the other programs of the frame,
The sizes of frame cores are determined using the same formula
as for other programs: Frame Core Rating2 x Frame Core
Multiplier. The size multiplier for all dumb frame cores is Z; the
multiplier is 3 for smart cores, Programmers must specify
whether a core will be dumb or smart when writing the core.
Frame cores may be equipped with any of the following
options: DINAB, optimization, and squeeze.
Core Ratings may not exceed the programmer's Computer
Skill x 1.5 (round fractions down). The following characteristics
are derived from the Core Rating
First. the combined ratings of the core's Bod, Evasion,
Masking, and Sensor attributes may not exceed the Core Rating
Any attribute may be set to 0. If the designing decker desires.
The Core Rating is used in place of an MPCP Rating for any
test requiring an MPCP Rating.
The Reaction attribute of a smart frame is equal to the
frame's Core Rating.

Finally, the combined ratings of all programs (not including
options) in the frame may not exceed the Core Rating. If Core
Rating Points have been allocated to the frame's Initiative, use
the reduced Core Rating for this purpose (see Smart Frame
Initiative, below).
Deckers may re-use frame cores with different combinations
of utility programs to make different frames. However, a core's
attributes may not be rearranged. To make a frame with different
attributes, the programmer must write a new frame core.
OInAB and Cores
All smart frame cores must be programmed with the DINAB
option, which acts as the core's Computer Skill. The addition of
the DINAB option increases the core's design rating by the
DINAB Rating
Dumb frames only execute programs on & decker's com.
mand. However, dumb cores may be fitted with the DINAB
option, which may trigger one of the frame's programs on a
given action
For both smart and dumb cores. the DINAB option rating
may not exceed the programmer's Computer Skill. The DINAB
Rating is set when the core is programmed and cannot be
altered later
Smart frame Initiative
Smart frames have their own Reaction and Initiative Ratings.
separate from the decker's ratings
An unmodified smart frame rolls: I DG for Initiative. However
the programmer can increase a smart frame's Initiative dice by
allocating part of its Core Rating to that purpose. Each point of
Core Rating allocated provides 1 additional Initiative die. Note
that whenever a frame's Core Rating is reduced, the ratings of
the frame's programs must be reduced so that their combined
total does not exceed the Core Rating
Core Rating Points must be allocated to Initiative at the time
the frame core is programmed antt cannot be changed later.
FRAME LOADING
Once a programmer has created a frame core, he can load
it with object code copies of any programs he has available. (The
programs need not carry the Link routine required under the
original SR Mattis rules.) These programs may be "plain vanilla"
ur equipped with options
The combined ratings mnot including Option Ratings) of
these programs may not exceed the frame Core Rating, If Core
Rating Points have Been allocated to the frame's Initiative, use
the reduced Core Rating for this purpose.
Programmers may not load "part of a utility into a frame
For example it the programmer has Deception 6, he cannot use
it to give the frame il copy of Deception-3. Programs don't work
that way. A pamal copy of a program isn't smaller-it is incom
plete jurist will not work
Loading programs onto a frame care is a task similar to pro
gramming First, the programmer musi calculate the Loading
Rating of the programs The Loading Rating is used only when
determining the task period for loading the programs. To calculate
the loading rate, combine the ratings of the programs and divide
by 2. The result is the Loading Rating. Do not include the ratings
of options or the frame core when calculating the Loading Rating.
Next, calculate the loading size
Loading Rating2 - loading size in Mp.
Then, determine the loading base time:
Loading size x 2 = loading base time in days
Now, make a Computer Test against the average rating of
the programs to be loaded. The Software concentration or Matrix
Programming specialization of the Computer Skill may be subst !tuted for this test. Use the number of successes to calculate the
loading task period:
Loading base time + Computer Test successes - task period
in days
The actual size of a frame is the actual size of the frame core
plus the actual size of all programs and options loaded on it.
Genie has a 12-point smart frame core with a DINAB-8 option. She
allocates 2 Core Rating Points to the frame's Initiative, so she has 10
points left over for programs.
She wants a self-directing Matrix weapon, a killer drone program,
so she decides to load Attack-6S and Cloak-4 programs on the frame.
That calculates the loading rating as follows:
(10 + 2)2 - 25
That gives her a loading base time of 50 days (25 x 2). She achieves
5 successes on her Computer Test, so the loading task period is 10
days (50 + 5).
Genie's smart frame is a husky program when completed: 1,200 Mp
for the core, 144 Mp for Attack-65, 48 Mp for Cloak-4 -- tor a total of
1,392 Mp.
RUNNING A FRAME
To run a frame, a decker first must log on to a host and then
upload the frame As soon as the uploart completes, the hame
stans running Compressed of squeezeit frames must be decom
pressed before they can run
DUMB FRAMES
Giving a command to a dumb frame is a Simple Action This
applies even it the frame program is used to perform a Complex
Action. For example. IL a Frame includes an analyze program, the
tlecker could use the frame to perform an. Analyze Security oper
ation as a Simple Action
The fame then carries out lis orders A dumb frame cannot
repeat an action. For example. a decker cannot tell .cdumb frame
to attack an IC program until it wins-he can only tell it to attack
once; A second attack requiresa second command to the frame
If & decker logs off a host, any dumb fames he K running
crash. They do not follow the decker to other systems or guds.
Dumb frames may serve a number of purposes, including
functioning as a decoy triggering an event, nt carrying
weapon

Decoy frames
Any dumb frame can act as a combination scout "drone".
and decoy, These so-called decoy frames can perform various
Analyze operations and may be fitted with scanner utilities and
used for Locate Decker operations. (See System Operations, p.
114. for further Information.]
If a decker performs a Decoy operation on a host or grid system, the system directs all security measures against the decoy
frame as long as the decker himself remains inactive. The decker
uses his own Computer Skill to make tests for the frame, but all
attribute-related scores depend on the decoy frame's ratings, not
his own. Only the utilities loaded into the frame can be
employed during the Decoy operation.
If the frame's actions create a security tally that triggers IC
programs, the IC programs go after the decoy frame, not the
decker's persona, Because the frame has the same dlatatrail ais
the decker, this doesn't help the decker's situation when facing
trace IC
Once a decoy frame crashes, the host system and any active
IC programs react ro subsequent actions by the decker per stan
dard rules.
Event Triggers
Deckers can also create dumb frames to notify them of specific events in the host system. The decker must be present on
the same system to receive the frame's message This may
require a Null operation (see System Operations, p. 117).
To serve as an event trigger, the frame needs a Sensor
attribute and analyze and/or scan utilities. The attribute and utilIties must have ratings equal to or exceeding half the host's
Security Value. An analyze utility is needed to detect events
caused by the host or its programs. The frame must contain a
scanner utility to detect events caused by other deckers or legitimate users on the host.
Deckers may Include any other utilities on the frame if additional capacity remains available.
Weapon Carriers
Deckers often load frames with offensive utilities and use
these "weapon carriers" as auxiliary weapons in cybercombat.
Such frames enable a decker to carry weapons that do not take
up active memory or his icon bandwidth. Of course, if the frame
crashes, the decker loses the programs. Each attack with a
weapon-carrier frame requires a Simple Action.
SMART FRAMES
Smart frames can perform any action a dumb frame can. In
addition, smart frames have their own "skill" (their DINAB
Rating), and their own Response and Initiative ratings. The decker uses a Free Action to give the smart frame a basic order, and
the frame then carries out that order on its own.
For example. a decker can order a smart frame equipped
with combat utilities to find and destroy an icon. The frame has
its own actions In game terms, the player who controls the
decker runs the frame as well, but the frame's actions do not
require any attention from the decker and do not use up any of
the character's actions.
UPGRADING
Deckers may upgrade any program described in this section-with the exception of command sets-by raising the program's rating. The programmer must have a copy of the program's source code to upgrade the program.
Upgrading programs is a programming task. To determine
the base time for an upgrade, first determine the base time for
the program as if creating the program from scratch (see
Programming, p. 100). Then calculate the base time for writing
the current program version. Then subtract the current version
base time from the upgraded version base time. The result is the
base time needed for the upgrade task,
Next. determine the task period. Begin by making a
Computer Test against the rating of the upgraded program.
Divide the upgrade task base time by the test successes. The
result is the task period in days. The rest of the programming
process proceeds per standard programming rules (see
Programming. p. 100),
Deckers may also upgrade a program by adding options to
the program, rather than increasing the program's rating
BUYING PROGRAMS
Deckers can purchase any of the programs described in this
section. A program's price is determined by its rating and design
size. Option ratings do not affect these prices, Make Availability
Tests using the Etiquette (Matrix) Skill
All prices given represent the cost of object code and a copy
of the source code. Reduce prices by 25 percent for object-code
only programs.
Under the Virtual Realities 2.0 rules, calculate prices for all
programs-Including personaware and utilities-using the formulas on the Program Prices Table. The distinctions for utility and
persona programs in the original SR Matrix rules were based on
the cost of the personaware chips. In the VR 2.0 rules, the
firmware price has been unbundled from the software price.

A system operation represents a command of series of commands that a decker gives to a
host or grid to perform a specific task. Almost any task a decker may perform in cyberspace Is

ONGOING OPERATIONS
Some operations are finished as soon as the decker suc

OPERATIONS DESCRIPTIONS
The following text pro
Tent set of available System opptatti
feelfree to invent additional
ler deckers proposent all

ANALYZE HOST
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
An Analyze Host operation enables a decker to analyze the
ratings of a host. For each success in the Control Test, the decker chooses one of the following pieces of information, which the
gamemaster supplies:
* the host's Security Rating (code and value)
* the rating of any one of the five subsystems on the host
· whether the apparent host is a VM (see Virtual Machines,
p. 34 of Grids and Hosts)
Seven or more successes gain the decker all the available
Information about the host. Note that a decker must be on the
host to run an Analyze Host operation on it-no sneak previews
from the grid.
ANALYZE IC
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Free
The Analyze IC operation enables a decker to identify any
specific IC program that he has located (deckers may locate IC
programs by performing Locate IC operations or by coming
under attack from the IC program). If the Analyze IC operation
succeeds, the decker learns the type and rating of the IC program and any options or defenses it carries. If the IC is a trace IC
program, the decker also learns whether the trace program is in
Its hunting or location cycle. If the IC program is in its location
cycle. the decker learns how many turns remain before it completes the cycle.
ANALYZE ICON
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Free
The Analyze Icon operation scans any icon and identifies its
general type: IC, persona, frame. application, and so on. The
decker may reduce the Control Test target number by his Sensor
Rating and any analyze utility he is running. However, the test
target number may not drop below 2, regardless of the decker's
combined Sensor and analyze utility ratings.
ANALYZE SECURITY
Test: Control
Utility: Analyze
Action: Simple
The Analyze Security operation tells the decker the current
Security Rating of the host, the decker's security tally on the host
(Including any tally points accrued by the test for Analyze
Security), and the host's alert status.
ANALYZE SUBSYSTEM
Test: Targeted Subsystem
Utility: Analyze
Action: Simple
An Analyze Subsystem operation identifies anything out of
the ordinary about the targeted subsystem. The operation identifies the presence of trap doors, worms, scramble IC programs,
or other defenses or system tricks present on the subsystem.
CONTROL SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Spoof
Action: Complex
The Control Slave operation enables a decker to take control
of a remote device controlled by the host's Slave subsystem.
Remote devices range from simple automatic security doors and
elevators to entire automated factories full of robotic assemblers.
If the decker is attempting to take control of a manufacturing or scientific process controlled by the Slave subsystem, he
must make the Slave Test with the average of his ratings In
Computer Skill and a B/R or Knowledge Skill that applies to the
process. For example, a decker attempting to take control of an
automated medical lab would make the test with an average of
his Computer and Biotech skills, or Computer and Medicine
skills, or Computer and some similar skill. Be strict about appropriate skills here, especially if the decker is attempting a task that
might call for some obscure skill specialization.
The Control Slave operation is a monitored operation.
CRASH APPLICATION
Test: Appropriate Subsystem
Utility: Crash
Action: Simple
The Crash Application operation shuts down one of the
host's application programs. Application programs include any
legitimate program other than IC or decking programs.
Applications take care of regular business on a host-you know,
the boring stuff,
The Subsystem Test for the operation depends on the application targeted. If the decker is targeting an application program
that controls a factory or a security Installation, for example, the
decker would make a Slave Test. The Crash Application operation
may also be used to shut down a legitimate user's session, which
is a function of the Files subsystem. If in doubt, the gamemaster
can always ask the character to make a Control Test.
Crash Application operations have no effect on IC programs,
frames, constructs, or other deckers.
CRASH HOST
Test: Control
Utility: Crash
Action: Complex
The Crash Host operation is the decker's "doomsday
weapon." A successful Crash Host operation forces the host to
shut down, dumping any hostile users as well as the decker
himself (unless, of course. he first performs a Graceful Logoff
operation).

Host systems do not shut down instantly. If a Crash Host
operation succeeds, divide the decker's successes into 10 Combat
Turns. The result is the number of turns that elapse before the host
shuts down. At the end of each Combat Turn of this countdown.
the host system tries to abort the process-make a Security Value
Test against the decker's MPCP Rating. If the test succeeds, the
shutdown process stops and the host stays up.
During the countdown to a crash, reduce the ratings of all IC
programs running on the host by 2, These reductions reflect the
drain on system resources caused when the host allocates
resources to the shutdown instruction. All reduced ratings return
to normal immediately if the crash is averted.
Note that a decker cannot abort a shutdown countdown
caused by a Crash Host operation he has performed.
A shutdown wipes out all frames, command sets, and other
programs left behind by the decker. The host computer reboots
itself, which automatically cleans all its code, deletes security tallies
and alerts, and restarts the host with all its basic ratings and values.
Typically, system administrators recognize decker-instigated crashes and increase security measures when restarting
host systems.
DECOY
Test: Control
Utility: Mirrors
Action: Complex
The Decoy operation creates a "decoy" copy of the decker's
Icon, This decoy may draw the "attention" of proactive IC programs that target the decker, Record the number of successes
the decker achieves on the Control Test. Whenever a proactive
IC program attempts to attack the decker, roll ID6. If the die roll
result is less than the number of the decker's Control Test successes, the IC attacks the decoy instead of the decker's real icon.
In the event of a tie, decoys fool IC programs.
Decoys have no special defenses and no damage resistance,
so they take full damage when hit. Decoys disappear when their
Condition Monitors fill up.
Note that decoys are not effective against trace IC.
Decoy operations may be used to lock the attention of IC
programs on frames (see Frames, p. 105).
DECRYPT ACCESS
Test: Access
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt Access operation defeats scramble IC programs
guarding access to a host. IC programs on a scrambled SAN must
be defeated with a Decrypt Access operation before a decker can
perform a Log-On to Host operation on a scrambled SAN.
DECRYPT FILE
Test: Files
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt File operation defeats scramble IC programs on a
file. Deckers must perform successful Decrypt File operations on
scrambled files before performing other operations on such files.
DECRYPT SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Decrypt
Action: Simple
The Decrypt Slave operation defeats scramble IC programs
on a Slave subsystem. A decker cannot make Slave Tests against
à scrambled Slave subsystem until he has performed a successful Decrypt Slave operation on the subsystem.
DISINFECT
Test: Appropriate Subsystem
Utility: Disinfect
Action: Complex
The Disinfect operation destroys worm virus programs on a
specific subsystem. The decker makes the operation test against
the targeted subsystem-if a host's Files subsystem has worm
programs, he makes a Files Test, for example.
DOWNLOAD DATA
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Download Data operation copies a file from the host to
the decker's cyberdeck. The data moves at whatever I/O bandwidth the decker has allocated. It may be transferred to active
memory, storage memory, or even off-line storage.
The Download Data operation is an ongoing operation that
continues until the data transfer is completed, the decker logs off
or is crashed, or the decker terminates the download early. If the
operation is terminated before the transfer is completed. It creates a corrupted copy of the file, which is worthless.
However, if the file contains information that is particularly
important to an adventure, the gamemaster may allow partially
completed downloads to produce damaged, yet readable file
copies, The base time to reconstruct a damaged file is calculated
as follows:
(full file size in Mp divided by amount of
data downloaded in Mp) x 2.
The result is in days. Once a damaged file is reconstructed, the
gamemaster determines whether the file contains the pertinent
information by dividing the size of the downloaded file by the ful
size of the original file.
For example, if a decker manages to copy 10 Mp of a 100 Mp
file, the base time for reconstructing the file is (100/10) x 2, or 20
days. Dividing 10 by 100 yields .10. so there is a 10 percent
chance that the copied file contains the pertinent information.
DUMP LOG
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex

The Dump Log operation is an interrogation operation that
enables & decker to open and read host-access logs, The logs
record the Identities of legal users who accessed the system,
which files they accessed, which programs they ran, and so on.
System logs also note any Intrusions or suspected intrusions that
the host observed-basically, any decker runs that triggered a
security response. However, Intrusions may also show up on system logs as fatal program aborts, hardware glitches, and other random system errors- particularly if they are successful, sneaky runs,
If Information on a system log is crucial to an adventure, the
gamemaster should prepare the log in advance. If log entries are
not particularly Important to an adventure, the gamemaster can
Improvise them.
Deckers may also download system logs onto their
cyberdecks for later analysis or documentation. The size of a log
covering a 24-hour period is calculated by multiplying the host's
log size multiplier by 100. The result Is in Mp

EDIT FILE
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Edit File operation enables a decker to create. change.
or erase a datafile. Small changes (approximately one line of
print or the equivalent of one short form of some kind) can be
made directly on the host by performing this operation. Before

replacing larger amounts of data, the decker must prepare the
new material off-line first, then upload it and perform an Edit File
operation to insert it into the file. Any uploaded information may
be inserted with a single Edit File operation, regardless of its size.
A successful Files Test creates new files. Because these files
do not have legal headers, the operating system may erase them
at any time.
Deckers also can use Edit File operations to make copies of files
on the same host. Thus, deckers can copy a file from a particularly
secure datastore, stash it on a less secure part of the same host and
retrieve it at a later time. When using the Edit File operation in this
manner, a decker must make two Subsystem Tests. The first test is
a Files Test. The second test is made against the subsystem that
controls the location where the decker hid the copied file.
After altering, Inserting, or deleting a file, a decker must
make a Computer Test against a target number equal to the
host's Files Rating x 2 to determine if the host notices his work.
The decker may add his deck's Masking Rating to his Computer
Skill Rating for this test. If the test succeeds, the host does not
notice the changes. If the test fails, it does.
Deckers may make the same Computer (Files Rating x 2)
Test to determine whether a host or another decker has tampered with a file. In this case, the decker may add his deck's
Sensor Rating to his Computer Skill for the test. If the test succeeds, the decker recognizes signs of tampering in the file.
Keep in mind that any time a decker deletes a host file, the
gamemaster must consider the impact on the adventure in
progress and decide whether back-up copies of the file exist.
EDIT SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utilities: Spoof
Action: Complex
The Edit Slave operation is a monitored operation that
enables a decker to modify data sent to or received from a
remote device controlled by the host's Slave subsystem, For
example, a decker could perform Edit Slave operations to alter
video signals or sensor readings from a computer-controlled
security system or alter readings being sent to a console or simulator.
GRACEFUL LOGOFF
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Graceful Logoff operation enables a decker to disconnect from a host and the LTG where he logged on to the grid
without experiencing dump shock.
In addition, a successful Graceful Logoff operation clears all
traces of the decker and his actions from the security and memary systems of the host. The operation also leaves the decker
Invulnerable to trace IC programs after he has disconnected (see
Trace IC, p. 45 of Intrusion Countermeasures).
INVALIDATE PASSCODE
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex
The Invalidate Passcode operation enables a decker to erase
a single passcode from a host's security tables. A decker may
also use the operation to trash the host's entire passcode list so
that no legitimate users can get on using passcodes. This forces
corp deckers to log-on to the host by illegal means and puts
them on a more even footing with the intruding decker. When a
decker attempts to wipe out an entire passcode list, add a +4
modifier to the target number for the decker's Control Test.
LOCATE ACCESS NODE
Test: Index
Utility: Browse
Action: Complex
The Locate Access Node operation is "directory assistance"
Sixth World-style. It enables a decker to find the codes of LTGs
that provide access to the hosts he wants. The operation also lets
him locate commcodes for regular trid calls.
Modify the target number for the Index Test according to
the decker's stated goal. For example, if all he knows is a company or individual name-"I'm looking for a Mitsuhama system"-apply a +1 modifier to the target number. If his goal is a
bit more specific-"I'm looking for a Mitsuhama public-relations
system"-do not modify the target number. If he has a definite,
specific goal-"I'm looking for the Mitsuhama public-relations
system out of the Mitsu office in Bellevue on LTG 5209"-apply
a -1 modifier to the target number,
Once a decker has located an LTG code, he need not repeat
the Locate Access Node operation to find the host in futureunless its owners change the address, of course.
The Locate Access Node operation is an interrogation operation.
LOCATE DECKER
Test: Index
Utility: Scanner
Action: Complex
The Locate Decker operation is a two-step process. The decker makes the standard System Test and then a Sensor Test, The
decker locates any other deckers whose Masking attributes are
equal to or lower than his Sensor Test results. In addition, he
knows if they log off or jack out. If a targeted decker is running a
sleaze utility, add its rating to the targeted decker's Masking
Rating to determine if the testing decker locates the target decker
Located deckers may break contact by maneuvering (see
Combat Maneuvers, p. 121).
Friendly deckers who wish to make their presences known
to each other may do so automatically.
LOCATE FRAME
Test: Index
Utility: Scanner
Action: Complex

The Locate Frame operation locates any smart frames or SKs
running on the host. The operation is not effective against IC constructs because the host protects them from application indexing. However. constructs may be located with the Locate IC
operation (see Locate IC, below).
LOCATE FILE
Test: Index
Utility: Browse
Action: Complex
The Locate File operation is an interrogation operation that
searches for specific datafiles. To use the operation, the decker
must have some idea of what he is looking for-"valuable
data" is not enough. In fact, that is a different operation (see
Locate Paydata).
If the operation succeeds, the decker knows the system
location of the file:
Distributed databases can make for a real scavenger hunt
through the Matrix. Here's a simple example: Host A contains one
master copy of a database; Host B contains subordinate files that
point back to this master, perhaps through a series of two or three
other hosts. At the level of computer access involved in decking, a
decker must get to the master database to extract or edit information. So a decker on Host B performs a Locate File operation and
finds the reference he is looking for, He opens the file to do a
Download Data operation and discovers it is actually a subordinate
file pointing him to another host. He switches to that host-the
subordinate files contain the LTG address of the next computer in
line-and goes through the process again, only to find that he has
to go to yet another host. The gamemaster can roll ID6 to determine how many of these links exist in a given chain of files.
Cybersushi is on a Green-6 host with Index-11. Sushi's Computer
Skill is 6, and he's running a Browse-5 utility. During the present
adventure, Sushi's chummers came across a reference to a project
at Nasticorp that might endanger their friends in an ork tribal squat
over in the Barrens. So Sushi broke into this low-level computer at
Nasticorp to look for more details. Sushi and the gamemaster might
engage in a dialog that goes something like this:
Sushi: OK, I am looking for any files with references to the Redmond
orks or projects in the Barrens.
Gamemaster: That's kind of broad. OK, roll away.
[The player makes the operation Index Test. He rolls 605 (Computer
Skill) against a Target Number 7 (Index Rating 11 - Browse Rating 5 +
1 target modifier for over-broad question). The gamemaster makes an
opposed Security Test for the host against the player's Masking
attribute. The player achieves 3 successes, the Security Test nets 2.
Sushi emerges with 1 success.)
Gamemaster: There's a couple of references that look promising.
Sushi: Any of them talking about project schedules, budget, anything
to do with specific plans?
Gamemaster: Ah-now that's useful. Let's see.
(Sushi and gamemaster repeat the Index Test and Security Test.
Sushi's question is more specific, so the gamemaster applies a -1 target modifier to the Index Test. Sushi achieves 4 successes and the
Security Test nets only 1. That leaves Sushi with a total of 4 successes for the operation.)
Gamemaster: Right-the keyword seems to be Project Nightwalker.
Something in some e-mail in the secure datafiles.
Player: Great. Find the message file, I want to read it.
At this point, the search for a specific file is really enough-and
asy successes by Sushi will hit 5 total successes anyway. The
gamemaster has already decided that this host is not secure enough
to contain the full details of Nasticorp's Incredibly evil scheme, but
the e-mail contains an origin address on a tougher host, where they
keep the real paydata. That host also contains the names of responsible individuals on the Nasticorp roster who can be located through
the personnel databases and Invited to unburden their consciences to
Sushi's muscular friends back in the physical world.
LOCATE IC
Test: Index
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
The Locate IC operation follows the same rules as the Locate
Decker operation. However, the decker automatically locates the
IC program(s) if his System Test succeeds-he need not make a
Sensor Test. The IC program(s) remains located unless it maneuvers to evade detection.
LOCATE PAYDATA
Test: Index
Utility: Evaluate
Action: Complex
The Locate Paydata operation is an interrogation operation
that enables a decker to search a host for marketable data. For
each net success the decker achieves on the operation Index
Test, the operation locates 1 point of paydata in the host (the
gamemaster assigns a paydata volume to every host-see
Mapping Matrices, p. 65), The operation continues until the
decker stops performing it or locates all the paydata on the host.
Once located, paydata must be downloaded in its entirety, If a
file contains 20 Mp. all 20 Mp must be downloaded or the swag is
useless. Paydata is fenced per standard SR rules (see p. 188. SRID).
LOCATE SLAVE
Test: Index
Utility: Analyze
Action: Complex
The Locate Slave operation follows the same rules as the
Locate File operation (see Locate File). The operation is used to
determine system addresses for specific remote devices controlled by the host. A vague Inquiry would be. "Find all the security cameras controlled by this computer." A very specific inquiry
would be. "Find the camera that monitors the eastern stairwell
door on the third floor.
On the other hand, most hosts are likely to control far fewer
slaves than files. 50 a decker need achieve only 3 successes on
his Index Test to locate the desired system. After locating the
slave node, a decker can perform operations such as Command
Slave and Read or Write Slave for that node.

LOGON TO HOST
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Logon to Host operation simply consists of an opposed
Access Test against the Access Rating of the host. Apply any
appropriate modifiers to the test and remember to begin counting the decker's security tally with any successes on the host's
Security Test.
The decker will not know the host's Access Rating until he
takes his first crack at the log on. At that point, the rating will be
all too evident. No need to make it a big secret.
Once the Access Test succeeds, the virtual landscape of the
computer becomes visible. If the decker is accessing a host
directly through a work station, his Icon may appear in scenery
corresponding to an I/O port (see p. 166, SRII), Of course, with
the preponderance of sculpted systems in the Matrix today, the
scene may be something quite unique
Gaining access to a host through a remote device means the
decker's icon enters the host at a slave controller, and access
through the console puts the decker in the heart of the CPU node.
These virtual locations do not affect the decker's tests, but are provided as guidelines when describing the scene to the decker,
Once on the host, the decker can perform all of the operations that take care of biz-analyzing the host and its defenses,
looking for paydata, fiddling files, the whole bit.
LOGON TO LTG
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The Logon to LTG operation simply consists of an opposed
Access Test against the Access Rating of the LTG. Apply any
modifiers for the jackpoint and bandwidth (see jackpoints, p. 28.
and Bandwidth, p. 90) and remember to begin counting the
decker's security tally on the grid with any successes from the
grid's Security Test. If the decker loses the test, his log-on
attempt fails, The decker can try again. but his security tally
remains on the grid for some time (typically, public LTGs
"remember" unauthorized access attempts for 1D3 x 5 minutes).
The decker also can switch to a different jackpoint before his next
log-on attempt-which means the grid will have to start a new
security tally for him.
Once the decker succeeds in the opposed Access Test, his
icon appears in the familiar virtual landscape of the LTG, From an
LIG. the decker can log on to the RTG that controls the LTG, or
on to the PLTG attached to this LTG (if he knows its address), or
to any host attached to the LTG (if he knows the host's address),
LOGON TO RTG
Test: Access
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
Once he has logged on to an LTG, a decker can log on to its
controlling RTG by performing a Logon to RTG operation. He
must perform this operation if he wants to connect to a different
LTG on the same RTG, or to a different RTG altogether.
To perform the operation, the decker makes an Access Test
against the RTG's Access Rating. Remember that "local" changes
In the LTG system ratings (see p. 26) will not carry over to the RTG.
The gamemaster can assign temporary changes to the RTG ratings.
of course. If a decker is accessing a grid such as Germany's. keep
In mind that the RTG can have different ratings from its dependent
LTGs, and use the RTG's Access Rating for the test.
Remember that an RTG maintains the same security tally for all
a decker's activities on any LTGs it controls, as well as the RTG itself.
Once the decker is on the RTG, he can perform a Logon to
LTG to reach any LTG attached to the RTG, or a Logon to RTG
operation to reach any other RTG in the world. The decker can
also perform Search RTG and Trace/Tap Call operations.
MAKE COMCALL
Test: Files
Utility: Commlink
Action: Complex
A decker on an RTG can make a call to any commcode on
an LTG controlled by that RTG by performing a Make Comcall
operation. But this operation is not just a way to beat payphones.
The decker can make a call, then move to another RTG and make
a call to a number under its control, then link the two together.
A decker can move to multiple RTGs in this manner, building a
secure conference call. Each call the decker links together
requires another opposed Files Test.
Deckers can be licensed to provide this service on various
RTGs. This means they get a passcode from the RTG vendor that
authorizes this operation. In that case, no tests are needed to
make the calls or link them together. This license is usually
restricted to corporate deckers.
Treat any trace routines run by the grid against the call as
trace IC, The decker's Trace Factor is the Trace Factor for the call.
All the tricks that work against trace IC, such as Redirect Datatrail
operations, can be used to make the call more secure.
The Trace Comcall operation cannot trace this kind of call.
but another decker could use the track utility to try to locate the
commcodes involved in the call. (See Tap Comcall, p. 118, for
further information.)
In addition, the decker can detect any taps or tracers on the
commlines by making a Sensor (Device Rating) Test. He can neutralize them with an Evasion (Device Rating) Test.
Deckers often arrange secure calls, or prepare frames that
can build them, as a profitable sideline. The typical charge is 100
nuyen per caller per minute.
The Make Comcall operation is a monitored operation.
MONITOR SLAVE
Test: Slave
Utility: Spoof
Action: Simple

The Monitor Slave operation is a monitored operation that
enables the decker to read data transmitted by a remote device, He
can listen to signals from audio pickups, watch feeds from security
cameras, examine readouts on a computerized medical scanner
hooked up to the host, and so on. As long as he maintains the operation. he receives constant updates from the device.
NULL OPERATION
Test: Control
Utility: Deception
Action: Complex
The gamemaster may require a decker to perform one or
more Null operations whenever the decker is waiting for something to happen, whether it is an event on the Matrix, the end of
an ongoing operation, or something else that involves hanging
around in cyberspace without making System Tests, The
gamemaster may also call for a Null operation if a decker is doing
anything that requires actions but not System Tests, such as
maintaining an Edit Slave. The gamemaster may secretly perform
these operations on behalf of the decker, If he so desires.
Use the host's base Security Value for its opposed Security
Test If the decker is inactive on the host for less than 10 seconds.
If the period of inactivity is less than a minute but more than 10
seconds, apply a +1 modifier to the Security Value. If the period
is less than an hour but more than a minute, apply a +2 modifier. If the period is less than 12 hours but more than 1 hour. apply
a +4 modifier apply an additional + 1 modifier for every additional 12 hours. The gamemaster may set an upper limit on the
inactive period, depending on the decker's ability to avoid falling
asleep in the event of such implausibly long times.
Selena begins a download that will complete in 12 seconds. She
has nothing else she wants to do, so she waits. The gamemaster
requires a Null operation and adds +1 to the host's Security Value.
On a different run, Selena is waiting for a ground team to get
through a locked door (don't you just hate those manual doors with no
computer overrides on the lock?). The gamemaster determines that
the maglock penetration task will take 7 minutes. He also performs a
secret Null operation for Selena and applies a +2 modifier to the
host's Security Value for the opposed Security Test. The Security Test
yields several successes that push the security tally past its next trigger step, which triggers a truly unpleasant IC program. The gamemaster decides to have the IC show up 3 minutes into the waiting period.
If the Security Test raises the decker's security tally and triggers a response from the host, the gamemaster should activate
the response as he sees fit, perhaps after a percentage interval of
the decker's period of inactivity.
REDIRECT DATATRAIL
Test: Control
Utility: Camo
Action: Complex
Deckers may perform Redirect Datatrail operations on any grid.
Reduce the target number for the opposing Security Test by the
decker's trace modifier (see Jackpoints, p. 28 in Grids and Hosts),
Deckers can leave only one redirect on a grid. For each grid
where a decker leaves a redirect, reduce his trace factor by I.
This reduction does not reduce the bandwidth modifier's effects
on the System Test for further Redirect Datatrail operations. See
Trace IC, p. 45. for more details.
RETRAIN
Test: Access
Utility: Commlink
Action: Free
The Retrain operation enables a decker to make his I/O
bandwidth wider or narrower. For the Access Test, use the
Access Rating of the system where the decker's icon is active.
The target number modifiers and effects on the Trace Factor are
determined by the decker's jackpoint (see Jackpoints, p. 28),
Deckers may perform Retrain operations and allocate more or
less I/O bandwidth at any time. even while loading data.
SCAN ICON
Test: Special
Utility: Scanner
Action: Simple
The Scan Icon operation enables a decker to gain information about any decker, frame, or SK he has located.
The decker makes a Computer Test against the Masking
Rating of the targeted icon. If the targeted icon is running a
sleaze utility, subtract the utility's rating from the scanning decker's scanner utility rating, Reduce the target number by the difference. If the sleaze program has a higher rating than the scanner program, Increase the target number by the difference
between the sleaze and scanner ratings.
For each success the decker achieves on his Computer Test.
he may choose one of the following pieces of information:
· MPCP Rating of the icon
· Any Persona Rating of the icon
· Response Increase Rating of the icon
Identifying an icon requires an Analyze Icon operation
directed at the icon.
SWAP MEMORY
Test: None
Utility: None
Action: Simple
The Swap Memory operation enables a decker to load a new
utility program into his deck's active memory and then upload it
to his online icon
Loading the utility to active memory is a Simple Action -- the
decker simply tells the deck to do it. If his deck does not have
enough active memory or free icon bandwidth to hold the new
program, he must first spend a Free Action to unload a program
from his deck's active memory. No tests are required for these
actions, (New-generation cyberdecks have virtually unlimited
bus speeds between storage and active memory, so the Load
Speed Rating from the original SR Matrix rules does not apply.)

Orice the utility is in active memory, it automatically starts
uploading to the icon. See Ongoing Operations, p. 110. for
details on just when the utility will be available to the persona."
Squeezed or Compressed utilities must be decompressed
before they can be used, which requires a Complex Action ..
TAP COMCALL
Test: Special
Utility: Commlink
Action: Complex
The Tap Commcall operation enables deckers to locate
active commcodes on an LTG, trace and tap commcalls. Deckers
use the commlink utility for all the tests required during this
monitored operation.
To locate active commcodes on an LTG, a decker must be
active on an RTG that controls the LTG. The decker makes an
Index Test to determine if any commcodes on the LTG are sending or receiving a call. If the decker finds a commcode in use, he
can make a Control Test to trace the call to its origin or destination. If multiple participants are making a conference call from
the commcode, each success on the test reveals the commcode
of one participant.
If the call was set up by another decker using the Make
Comcall operation, then the Control Test locates the decker controlling the call. The decker trying to trace the call must move to
the calling decker's RTG and use a track utility against him. The
track utility locates all the other commcodes involved in the call.
If the decker wants to tap the call and record it in his deck's
storage memory or offline storage, he must make a Files Test.
Each minute of recording occupies 1 Mp of storage.
If the comm connection is scrambled, the decker must
decrypt it by making an unopposed Computer Test against the
tating of the Data Encryption System on the comm line. The
decrypt utility reduces the target number. The number of phones
and encryption devices involved in the call have no effect on the
decker's target number, If the first decryption test fails, the decker can try again: apply a +2 modifier to the target number for
each additional test. None of the tests against scrambling affect
the decker's security tally on the RTG.
If any of the phones involved in the call is equipped with a
dataline scanner, the decker may set that off even if he doesn't
trigger an alert on the RTG. Dataline scanners (p. 243, SRII) have
a rating from 1 to 10. Once the decker establishes his tap, the
decker must make a Computer Test against the scanner's rating
[the commlink utility reduces this target number), If the decker
achieves a single success, he has synchronized the tiny fluctuations in signal integrity caused by his tap and fooled the scanner.
If multiple dataline scanners are in use on the call, use the highest rating among them for the test. In this case. the decker needs
1 success for each scanner involved, of some of the devices
detect the tap (presumably the more expensive ones), Whether
this rest succeeds or fails, the result does not affect the decker's
security tally on the RTG.
Once a decker has tapped and unscrambled a call, he can
listen in and record, as he wishes. When the call terminates, he
can stay locked on to any of the commcodes, either the original
one that he was after or any that he traced. He can then attempt
to monitor any subsequent calls placed from the commcode. If
the decker is monitoring a code that he has already tapped, he
does not need to make Index Tests to determine when it
becomes active again. He does need to make new tests to trace
or tap the new calls and defeat any dataline scanners or encryption on the calls.
UPLOAD DATA
Test: Files
Utility: Read/Write
Action: Simple
The Upload Data operation is an ongoing operation that
enables a decker to transmit data from his cyberdeck to the
Matrix. This data comes directly from the deck's storage memory and does not affect active memory. (For large uploads, see
Bandwidth. p. 90, for the rules governing upload times).
If the decker is creating a new file on the host, the file is written automatically. If the decker intends to modify an existing file
on the host-adding false records to a database, for examplethe decker must perform an Edit File operation after the upload
is finished.
Note that the Upload Data operation is not used to upload
utilities. The Swap Memory operation handles that function,
VALIDATE PASSCODE
Test: Control
Utility: Validate
Action: Complex
The Validate Passcode operation enables a decker to plant a
fake passcode on a host. (Actually, "fake" is a misnomer, because
such passcodes are perfectly legitimate), Once logged on to a system, the decker can start doing any of his usual operations. For
example, the decker can open accounts on mainframes where he
is stealing programming time, swiping resources from the corps
while he busily perfects the tools he will use against them.
The decker makes a Control Test to validate his passcode,
Apply a +2 modifier to the target number to validate a superuser
passcode and a +6 modifier to validate a supervisor passcode
(see Passcodes. p. 35, for further information).
After the decker makes the test, the gamemaster rolls ID6
and multiplies the result by the number of successes from the
rest. The result Is the number of days the passcode remains
effective, unless the decker does something to compromise it
first. Any time the decker uses the passcode on a run that raises
a host to active alert status, the host flags the passcode as illegal. Once it recognizes a passcode as illegal, the host deletes it.

Deckers, IC, SKs (see Artificial Intelligences, p. 140), and frames can engage in
cybercombat. Icons representing system resources and applications cannot attack or
be attacked this way. Deckers may use system operations to engage these icons

CYBERCOMBAT SEQUENCE
Cybercombat in Matrix 2.0 follows much the same sequence
as standard SR combat. First, the opposing characters and icons
determine Initiative, then declare and resolve their actions,
Combat Turns in the Matrix are 3 seconds long, the same as
standard Shadowrun Combat Turns. (Though 3 seconds is an
endlessly long time in actual computer use. the 3-second turn
enables gamemasters to more easily synchronize Matrix actions
and physical actions elsewhere in the game.) Resolve any simultaneous actions in a Combat Phase in the following order: astral
actions, Matrix actions, and physical actions, with the following
exceptions
If a decker declares a Delayed Action (p. 80. SRII) to wait for
something to happen in the physical world, resolve his action
along with any physical actions of the Combat Phase. For example, John has an action available on Combat Phase 10 of a turn.
He delays his action, waiting for his meat colleagues to get to a
security door. An IC program jumps John during Combat Phase
8. The IC program resolves its action along with other Matrix
actions during Combat Phase 8 John must wait to resolve his
action along with the physical actions of the phase. So think hard
about delaying, netheads-combat usually goes to the swiftest.
Deckers who are communicating directly by voice of
datascreen with the meatworld resolve their actions along with
the physical actions of a Combat Phase as well, even if they have
actions available before that time. This penalty does not apply to
communications via hitcher electrodes, with someone "along for
the ride" on the decker's own terminal, or to communications
with other personas on the system.
SUBJECTIVE TIME
Keep in mind that characters experience time subjectively in
the Matrix. The apparent time spent in moving through the
Matrix environment may be much longer than the actual game
time used to perform actions. For example, a decker who makes
a single Index Test as part of a system operation may experience
the test as a walk down a long hallway lined with books, which
ends when he finds the icon he wants. He may feel as if he has
spent several minutes or even hours searching for the item,
when actually only a few seconds of game time elapse.
INITIATIVE
Any icons with a Reaction attribute roll for Initiative per standard SR rules (p. 79, SRII).
DECHER INITIATIVE
The Initiative of a decker is based on the Reaction attribute of the
decker's persona. If his Reaction has no enhancements, the decker
rolls ID6 and adds the result to his Reaction to determine Initiative.
Reality filters, response-increase circuitry, and running on
hot decks by DNI all boost a decker's Initiative (see Cyberdecks.
p. 81, for additional information on these items).
Wired reflexes, magical augmentation, vehicle-control rigs.
and other enhancements that increase the Reaction attribute of a
decker's physical body do not affect Initiative in the Matrix.
Initiative and the Physical World
If a decker is engaged In direct communication with the
physical world via voice, print, datascreen, and so on, he loses
1D6 of Initiative until he drops the communications link. This
penalty does not apply to communications with a meathead via
hitcher electrodes, nor does it apply to users with tortoises.
IC INITIATIVE
When calculating the Initiative of an IC program, use the formulas supplied in the IC Initiative Table. For IC constructs, use the
rating of the lowest-rated IC program in the construct. For IC programs arranged in a party cluster, determine Initiative separately
for each program.
If the Security Code of the host changes during the course of a
fight, the Initiative of IC programs on the host changes accordingly.
IC INITIATIVE TABLE
Host Security Code
Blue
Initiative
ID6 + IC Rating
Green
2D6 + IC Rating
Orange
3D6 + IC Rating
Red
4D6 + IC Rating
OTHER PROGRAMS
Smart frames, SK's and other autonomous expert systems
have Reaction attributes equal to their Core Ratings (see Frames,
p. 104 and Artificial Intelligences. p. 138, for details), Roll 1D6
for Initiative for such systems unless they have response
enhancements.
When determining Initiative for any other programs,
assume they have Reaction attributes equal to their ratings and
roll ID6 for Initiative. For programs without ratings, use a flat
value of 6 as a Reaction attribute for the calculation.
ACTIONS
An icon may take one Free Action, and either two Simple
Actions or one Complex Action during a Combat Phase.
Besides the actions listed here, deckers may perform system operations. These are listed in System Operations, p. 111.
and the System Operations Table, p. 161. Deckers must perform specific actions to execute each operation.
FREE ACTIONS
Free Actions are simple, almost automatic actions that
require hardly any effort to complete.

Delay Action
Deckers may delay actions per standard SRII rules (see pp.
80-81. SRII). See Cybercombat Sequence, p. 120, for rules on
resolving delayed actions.
Speak a Word
Standard SRII rules apply for verbal communications (see p.
81, SRII). Direct communications with characters in the physical
world affect the decker's Initiative as noted in Cybercombat
Sequence.
Deckers may also "buffer messages. When buffering a message, the decker may write a message up to 100 words long and
give it to any character linked to the decker with hitcher electrodes, radiolink, datascreen, or other device. The second character may also operate an icon the decker can "see."The second
character receives the buffered message at the end of the
Combat Turn.
Terminate Doumload/ Upload
A decker can suspend or terminate a data transmission at
any time.
Unload Program
The decker can remove a program from his deck's active
memory at any time, Removing a program releases active memDry and icon bandwidth for a Swap Memory operation.
Unsuppress IC
A decker can release IC from suppression and restore the
points being used to suppress the IC to his Detection Factor at
any time. If the suppression was keeping crashed IC from
Increasing the decker's security tally, the tally increases immediately. If the suppression was suspending the IC's actions, it
becomes active Immediately. (See Suppressing IC. p. 40 in
Intrusion Countermeasures, for further information.)
SIMPLE ACTIONS
A Simple Action requires a bit more concentration to perform than a Free Action, and may be slightly more complex.
Attack
A decker may attack an icon with any offensive utility
loaded in his deck. IC programs and other icons may attack
according to their programming.
Combat Maneuvers
Deckers and icons may engage in any listed combat maneuvers as a Simple Action (see Combat Maneuvers, p. 121),
Improvise Attack
Deckers can use Simple Actions to create attack programs
"on the fly" (see Improvised Attacks. p. 123).
COMPLEX ACTIONS
Performing a Complex Action requires intense concentration on only that task.
Change Deck Mode
Changing mode (see Deck Modes, p. 74 in Deckers) is a
Complex Action.
non-COMBAT ACTIONS
For non-combat actions, deckers need not roll for Initiative
Instead, divide the decker's Reaction attribute by 10 (round up the
result). The result is the number of actions the decker may perform
during each 3-second game turn. Add I action for every Initiative
die the decker receives in combat beyond the standard. ID6.
During each available action the decker can perform one
Free Action, and either one Complex Action or two Simple
Actions. The decker can perform another Free Action in place of
either or both of the Simple Actions.
For example, a decker with 2 actions per turn could perform
a Logon to Host operation (a Complex Action) and a Retrain
operation on his I/O bandwidth (a Free Action) on his first action
phase. On the next action, he could perform an Analyze Host
operation (a Complex Action).
Reactive IC programs that perform tasks at the end of a
Combat Turn act after all deckers have performed their allotted
actions for a turn.
INITIATING COMBAT
A decker may initiate combat with any Icon that is "visible"
or any icon he has located. Any Icon that attacks a decker automatically becomes visible, unless it successfully performs a combat maneuver to conceal Itself (see Combat Maneuvers)
Deckers may locate reactive IC programs by performing the
appropriate Analyze operations, and they may locate other deckers by performing Locate Decker operations (see System
Operations, p. 114). In addition, other deckers may make themselves visible to a decker by communicating with him, attacking
him, or deliberately revealing themselves in some other way.
Once a decker is "visible" or located, he remains so unless he
makes a successful combat maneuver to evade detection.
Proactive IC programs may initiate combat with any decker
whose security tally triggers the IC. The IC program can continue
to attack until the decker gets off the system or evades detection
with a combat maneuver,
COMBAT MANEUVERS
Deckers, proactive IC, smart frames, and any other selfdirected icons can perform combat maneuvers to avoid detection, parry attacks, or gain a position to make more accurate
attacks. All combat maneuvers are Simple Actions.

Each combat maneuver requires an opposed test between
the icon performing the maneuver and the icon opposing the
maneuver. The maneuvering icon makes an Evasion Test. If the
maneuvering icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a
Security Test for the program, using the host's Security Value.
(Non-IC programs that lack Evasion attributes cannot perform
combat maneuvers.)
The opposing Icon makes a Sensor Test. If the maneuvering
icon is an IC program, the gamemaster makes a Security Test for
the icon using the host's Security Value, (Non-IC programs that
lack Sensor attributes cannot oppose maneuvers actively.
However, if the maneuvering Icon achieves no successes on its
test, the maneuver still fails.)
If the maneuvering icon achieves more successes, note the
net successes-the number of successes that exceed the opposing test successes, The net successes determine how successfully the icon maneuvered. If the opposing icon achieved an equal
or greater number of successes, the combat maneuver fails.
If the maneuvering icon has a cloak utility, reduce that icon's
target number by the Utility Rating. If the opposing icon has a
lock-on utility, reduce its target number by the Utility Rating.
EVADE DETECTION
An icon may perform an evade-detection maneuver to
evade an opposing icon that has detected it.
A decker must use the Analyze Icon operation to re-detect
an IC program that has evaded him with the maneuver. To redetect personas, frames, or SKs that have evaded him, a decker
must use a Locate Decker operation.
IC programs re-detect evading icons in a number of Combat
Turns equal to the net successes of the icon's Evasion Test. This
time is shortened by | turn for each point added to the icon's
security tally during the period, The IC program shows up at the
end of the last turn of the evasion period. ready for the Initiative
step in the next Combat Turn.
Deckers may use evade-detection maneuvers to evade trace
IC programs during the programs' hunting cycles. These programs cannot be evaded during their location cycles. Other
forms of reactive IC cannot be evaded at all.
Cybersushi is on an Orange-8 host when he comes under attack from
a killer IC program. He needs a breather to upload a more powerful
attack program, so he attempts an Evade IC operation.
First, Sushi makes his Evasion Test against the host's Security Value.
He has an Evasion attribute of 6, so he rolls 606. He also has a Cloak-4
utility, so the target number for the test is 4 (host Security Value - Cloak
Rating). Sushi achieves 3 successes. Meanwhile, the gamemaster
makes a Security Test for the host against Sushi's Evasion Rating. He
rolls 806 against a Target Number 6 and achieves 1 success.
That makes Sushi the winner of the test with 2 net successes. As a
result, he evades the killer IC program for 2 Combat Turns.
However, the host spots Cybersushi during the next turn as the decker runs a Swap Memory operation. His security tally rises 2 points,
which wipes out his evasion period-the killer IC program re-detects
him at the end of the turn.
PARRY ATTACH
The parry-attack maneuver enables the maneuvering icon to
enhance Its defenses in cybercombar. If the maneuvering icon
wins the opposed test, increase target numbers for attacks
against the icon by its net successes on the test.
The bonus lasts until the next attack by the opposing icon. If
the opposing icon performs a position-attack maneuver, the
maneuvering icon retains the parry bonus. If either icon performs
an evade-detection maneuver, the bonus is lost.
POSITION ATTACK
The position-attack maneuver enables an icon to position
Itself for an attack on an opponent, This is a dangerous maneuver that may backfire on an icon. If the maneuvering icon wins
the opposed test. the icon may reduce the target number for its
next attack by its net successes or Increase the Power of its attack
by the net successes. If the opposing icon wins the opposed test.
that Icon receives the bonus.
The bonus lasts only until the next attack,

Cybersushi has an Evasion attribute of 5 and is running a Cloak-2
utility when he runs into a corp decker with a Sensor attribute of 5 and
a Lock-On-3 utility. Sushi tries a position-attack maneuver to get the
jump on his opponent. He makes an Evasion Test against a Target
Number 3 (opposing icon's Sensor Rating - Sushi's Cloak Rating). His
opponent makes a Sensor Test against a Target Number 3 (Sushi's
Evasion Rating - opposing icon's Lock-On Rating). Sushi achieves 4
successes on his test, but his opponent achieves 5. As a result, the
corp decker may decrease the target number of his next attack against
Sushi by 1 or increase the Power of his attack by 1.
Sushi uses his remaining Simple Action in the phase to perform a
parry-attack maneuver. The tests are the same, but this time Sushi
wiss, with a net success of 1. That increases the target number of the
corp decker's attack by 1. The corp decker decides to accept the
increased target number and applies his position-attack bonus to the
Power of his attack.
RESOLVING ATTACHS
All cybercombat attacks are Simple Actions: To make an
attack, the attacker makes a test with his offensive utility program. (Hacking F'ool dice may be used to augment the program.)
The target number for the test depends on two factors: the target icon's status -- Legitimate or Intruding-and the Security
Code of the host where the attack occurs. Any decker icon or IC
program that has logged onto a system with a valid passcode is
considered Legitimate. All other icons are Intruding. The
Cybercombat Target Numbers Table provides target numbers for
cons based on these factors
Apply any appropriate target-number modifiers from utility
options, maneuvers, damage, and so on.

An Intruding decker may attempt to alter his own target
number in the middle of a run by performing a Validate Passcode
operation to create a temporary Legitimate persona for himself.
This is an ad hoc combat trick-it does not stop IC programs and
other programs from attacking or affect System Tests, but it can
make the decker harder to hit. The host detects and deletes the
faked passcode as soon as the decker logs off.
Of course, a decker may log on using a Legitimate passcode
or a previously planted faked one. In general, if the decker uses
that passcode to get Legitimate status during a fight with the
host's own security programs, the host devalidates the passcode
when the decker jacks out or logs off. He has blown his cover, so
to speak. However, he can use the passcode in combat against
Intruding deckers without blowing his cover.
Record the number of successes scored on the Attack Test,
because they determine the effects of the attack. The various
types of offensive utilities have different effects on their targets.
Some reduce specific ratings of the targeted icon, while others
inflict damage on a decker's physical body. Any special effects
and opposed tests made by the targeted icon are noted in the
offensive utility descriptions (see Offensive Utilities, p. 98, in
Programs). For offensive utilities that do not inflict special damage, see Icon Damage, below.
IMPROVISED ATTACHS
Under Matrix 2.0 rules, a decker can write an attack program "on the fly" as a Simple Action. Such improvised attack
programs may be used for single attacks only-as one-shot utilIties, in other words.
The decker sets the attack program's Power by allocating
points from his Evasion and/or Bod ratings. Any combination of
points is allowed. However, the Power may not exceed the
MPCP Rating of the character's cyberdeck.
The decker's Evasion and/or Bod ratings remain reduced by
the number of points allocated to the attack program until he uses
the attack program. If he fails to complete the attack program successfully, the ratings remain reduced until his next action.
To finish creating the attack program, the decker makes a
Computer Test against a target number equal to the program's
Power. On 1 success, the program has a Damage Level of Light:
on 2 successes, Moderate: on 3 successes, Serious: 4 or more
successes gives the program a Damage Level of Deadly.
ICON DAMAGE
Many offensive utility and IC programs, such as the hog and
reveal utilities and the poison and acid IC programs, inflict specialized forms of damage. Rules for resolving and resisting these
effects are provided in the entries for those programs (see
Programs, p. 94, and Intrusion Countermeasures, p. 38).
Other programs, such as attack and killer IC programs, inflict
damage per standard Shadowrun rules. Each of these programs
has a Damage Code, which consists of a numeric Power and a
Damage Level: Light, Moderate, Serious, or Deadly. The Power
for such programs is equal to their ratings.
The Damage Level for such IC programs is determined by
the host's Security Code, as shown on the IC Damage Table.

For every 2 successes on the attacker's Attack Test, stage up

The Icon that has been hit rolls a Damage Resistance Test
using its Bod Rating against a target number equal to the Power
of the damage. For IC programs that take damage, make a
Damage Resistance Test using the host's Security Value, The
armor utility reduces the Power for the test, For every 2 successes on the test, stage down the Damage Level by 1 level.
Cassie is attacked by a Killer-6 program on an Orange host, so she
faces 65 damage. To make matters worse, the IC achieves 3 successes on its Attack Test, so the damage stages up to 60.
Cassie is running an Armor-4 utility, which reduces the Power of
the attack to 2. Cassie makes a Bod (2) Test and achieves 4 successes. That stages the damage her persona takes down to Moderate.
CONDITION MONITORS
All Icons use a Condition Monitor. Each Condition Monitor
has 10 boxes, which are filled in as the icon takes damage per
the Condition Monitor Table, Once all 10 boxes are filled, the
icon crashes. If the icon is a persona, the persona's decker Is
dumped from the Matrix. The decker is vulnerable to dump
shock (see Dump Shock, below) and possibly other effects
(when black IC kills an Icon, It does not disconnect the deckerIt just makes it easier to fry his brain).

SIMSENSE OVERLOAD
Whenever a decker's icon takes damage from white or gray
IC. the decker's physical body may suffer Stun damage through
a resonance effect over the ASIST interface. This can only occur
on hor decks. Cool decks and tortoises are immune to this effect.
To determine whether the decker takes simsense overload
damage, he makes a Willpower Test against a target number
based on the damage taken by his icon. These target numbers
are provided in the Overload Damage Target Numbers table. If
the decker is running hot with a DNI-only interface, increase the
target number by 2. If the deck has an ICCM, reduce the target
number by 2. Any icon that takes Deadly damage crashes automatically and exposes the decker to dump shock.
If the Willpower Test fails, the decker suffers a Light Stun
wound and fills in I box on his Mental Condition Monitor.
Simsense overload damage is not an issue when dealing
with black IC. Any damage the decker suffers in that case Is no
side effect!

DUMP SHOCK
When a decker is crashed off the Matrix or jacks out without
performing a Graceful Logoff operation, he risks Stun damage
from dump shock. The Power of the damage equals the host's
Security Value. This measures the shock of the sudden transition
from virtual to physical reality. The Damage Level is determined
by the host's Security Code, as shown on the Dump Shock
Damage Levels table.
If the decker was running a cool deck when dumped, reduce
the damage Power by 2 and lower the Damage Level by I level.
If the deck was equipped with an ICCM, reduce the Damage
Code in the same manner. These reductions are cumulative, so a
cool deck equipped with an ICCM provides a 4-point reduction
to the Power and lowers the Damage Level by 2 levels.
Tortoise users are Immune to dump shock.

Semi-autonomous knowbots, or SKs, are expert systems
with high-density, random-decision pathway capacities, SKs
have limited extrapolatory ability, and it has been posited that SK
architecture In a sufficiently powerful computing engine-an
ultraviolet level host-might achieve "critical mass" connectivity
In Its holographic neural network and become a true artificial
Intelligence. Whether the theory of critical mass connectivity Is
valid or not remains unknown, but rumors persist of functioning
Als-truly sentient beings born of and living in the Matrix.
SEMI-AUTONOMOUS KNOWBOTS
SK technology was pioneered by Renraku, but despite that
corporation's attempt to keep the algorithms "maximally proprietary" (I.e., top secret), SKs have been reported in use by such
megacorporations as Fuchi and Aztechnology, and by SSET in Tir
na nOg. SK programs are capable of self-directed data transport
on the Matrix. In other words, they can move. In effect, SKs are
mobile virtual machines, personas without cyberdecks,
So far, stable SK programs have been developed only under
the leadership of designers of genius. Developing these codes is
beyond the capabilities of canned algorithm generators and
comp-sci expert systems
In game terms, programming SKs requires the use of a Red10 or higher mainframe and programming resources equal to
half-a-dozen top programmers with Computer Skills of 12 or
higher. SKs must be custom-programmed for specific missions.
For example, a hunter-killer SK intended to assault a Fuchi data
fortress must be almost completely rewritten to go after an AZT
asset or assassinate a particularly irritating decker.
SKs should show up only rarely in Shadowrun games, Their
presence in an adventure represents a serious expenditure of
Matrix assets by a major power, As a result, SKs should be limit.
ed to major adventures or campaigns that involve powerful
megacorps or other equally potent organizations or individuals.
SHS AND NATIVE HOSTS
An SK is "born" within a native host-a system created by a
master program on a high-powered mainframe, The mainframe
must be of equal or greater processing power than the master
program, which is why corps don't scatter too many of these
around-they consume Immense amounts of machine time.
All SKs repair any damage to their Condition Monitors and
Persona Ratings by logging on to their native hosts. If an SK is damaged while on its native host, It may receive the effects of a medic of
restore program at a rating equal to Its MPCP by spending a Complex
Action, Such repairs do not require points from the SK's Utility Pool
Naturally, SKs have passcodes for their native host systems,
The excessive demands on the mainframe of maintaining
the native host make SKs a cost-prohibitive way of maintaining
"unkillable" IC. However, most observers believe that ongoing
research will one day yield more efficient master programs that
will make such arrangements feasible.
SH RATINGS
The MPCP Rating of an SK equals ID6 + 6. The MPCP Rating
multiplied by 3 equals the maximum total of the SK's Bod
Evasion, Masking, and Sensor programs. No single Personā
Rating may exceed the MPCP Rating. All SKs have a Computer
Skill equal to their MPCP Ratings

SKs do not load utility programs, Instead, every SK has a
Utility Pool of points equal to its MPCP Rating + ID6. (See Utility
Pool, below, for rules on allocating Utility Pool points.}
The following represent a few typical SK configurations,
though the gamemaster may design SKs with any number of
Persona-Rating distributions because each is written for a specific mission:
MPCP-7/6/5/5/5
Computer Skill: 7
Pool: 8 to 13
MPCP-8/6/6/6/6
Computer Skill: 8
Pool: 9 to 17
MPCP-9/8/7/6/6
Computer Skill: 9
Pool: 10 to 15
MPCP-10/8/8/7/7
Computer Skill: 10
Pool: 11 to 16
MPCP-11/9/8/8/8
Computer Skill: 11
Pool: 12 to 17
MPCP-12/9/9/9/9
Computer Skill: 12
Pool: 13 to 18
UTILITY POOL
An SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool points to
any utility program for use as the need arises (assume that SKs
have access to all utilities at all times). Allocating points is a Free
Action:
An SK can mimic any operational utility program by using its
Utility Pool points. Each point from the pool acts as I Program
Rating Point. The maximum rating for any utility is equal to the
SK's MPCP Rating. Allocating Utility Pool points is a Free Action,
Almost all SK utilities work the same as standard utilities
with the following exceptions:
Black hammer and killjoy programs require 2 Utility Pool
points for each Program Rating Point. Any Utility Pool points allocated to restore or medic programs cannot be re-allocated until
the SK returns to its native host and regenerates its code.
Finally, an SK's controlling player may allocate Utility Pool
points to the SK's Initiative Rating.
SH RESPONSE
An SK's base Reaction Rating equals its MPCP Rating, with
ID6 for Initiative. The SK's controlling player may increase the
SK's Initiative by allocating Utility Pool points: 1 point provides
2D6, 3 points provide 3D6, and 5 points provides 4D6-the
maximum increase allowed.
RUNNING AN SK
An SK has a specific mission objective, which may be simple or complex. Mission objectives may Involve single Matrix
runs or extended series of intrusions until the program locates its
ultimate objective. In the Matrix, SKs behave like fanatically dedicated deckers with no sense of personal survival. The SK may be
a combat monster, a cyberspy that depends on stealth-anything
that enables it to achieve its mission objective.
SKs are subject to damage and destruction just like any
other icons, When the SK's Condition Monitor is filled, the program crashes and is gone. The programs have no fear of death,
of course, but their parameters make them evade or avoid combat if it seems likely that they will crash before fulfilling their
objectives,
SKs cannot jack out when the going gets rough. They must
perform Graceful Logoff operations to leave hosts and Logon to
Host operations to access their native hosts and reach "safety."
However, SKs are typically programmed NOT to return to their
native hosts if doing so might create incriminating datatrails to
their creators
If an SK is destroyed on a mission, of course, its creators can
generate another one on the native host. Doing so is expensive, but
it costs less than paying off a corpdecker's life Insurance policy.
TRUE AI
True artificial intelligence (Al) programs are fully self-aware,
self-sustaining, immensely powerful Matrix programs.
Ultimately, every gamemaster must decide how many-if anyAls he wants to introduce into his game. Generally. Als should
be incredibly rare. Nothing will take the mystery out of this new
life-form faster than having an Al turn out to be the "threat of the
week" every time the players turn around, If an Al is involved in
an adventure, the gamemaster should consider carefully why the
program is taking a hand in events, what it expects to get, and
how it will deal with any threats to its safety that might arise.
Indeed, In most cases an Al will go to great lengths to prevent
deckers from discovering its true identity,
Of course, the shadows have long been rife with rumors of
living programs, so an Al may decide its secret is safe-after all,
anything the player characters say may be discounted as just
another rant by some deckhead who's running his ASIST power
a little too hot. Of course, an entity that can transfer funds from
anywhere on the Matrix into credsticks and e-mail directives to
human hirelings can easily use more forceful means of silencing
troublesome Matrix runners.
The weakest form of newborn Al would be on a par with an
SK, but with self-regenerating ability-perhaps the power to create a native host environment on any sufficiently powerful computer. More powerful Als might possess the ability to weave
together wasted memory, dataspace, and distributed processing
power on scores of hosts into virtual "pocket universes" in cyberspace-ultraviolet systems independent of any single host, systems that are everywhere and nowhere,
In addition to all the ratings that SKs possess, Als also have
Threat Ratings. The Threat Rating may be used as extra dice for
all the Al's tests, in the same manner as physical characters'
Threat Ratings. A typical newborn Al has a Threat Rating of 1;
more mature Als have Threat Ratings of 4 and up.
The main thing to remember when roleplaying Als is chat
these programs exist independently of human control. They are
not restricted to any single mainframe. They are self-aware, selfdirecting, self-sustaining life-forms. In effect. they are superhuman deckers with superhuman Matrix powers, unburdened by
physical bodies. Of course, Als are not human, and their consciousness and motivations may just be their most mysterious,
Incomprehensible aspects.

Consider the otaku, the so-called children of the
Fast coming int
Inheritance,
the oldest kne
otaku are in their late teens today. And their numbers keep growing some
otaku reportedly go under the laser for their first Jack as young as seven or eight. No one knows
for certain. however, how many otaku exist of their true Influence on the Matrix. In fact. many
observers deny the existence of the otaku altogether. Despite the lack of statistically significant
evidence, rumors that these mysterious individuals ply their remarkable skills in the net refuse
to die out of the decker community.

The role of the otaku in his Shadowrun game is entirely up
to the gamemaster. He may choose to leave them offstagealmost legends, like those presented in Denver, The City of
Shadows, with powers and limitations unknown to the players,
Or the gamemaster may use the model presented here, but limit
the otaku to non-player-character roles. Or the gamemaster may
allow players to create otaku characters.
BECOMING OTAKU
Some experts claim that several otaku communities exist,
each with its own distinctive subculture. However, all share certain
behavior patterns. First, the otaku communities seem to select
new members according to a highly intuitive process. In most
cases, it seems that established community members bring in
recruits from the streets, prompted to do so by some inner voice.
Many otaku recruits spend their earliest years scrabbling for
basic survival in the worst barrens of Seattle, Denver, and
DeeCee. Some rumors tell of children as young as two or three
found on the doorstep of otaku communities. Once a child is
accepted into an otaku community, he undergoes a probationary
period. During this time, he begins to learn the ways of the
Matrix. Candidates begin hands-on Matrix runs almost at once.
They start with tortoises, then move up to 'trode connections to
live decks. After an unspecified period of time, a recruit either
leaves the otaku community or accepts a datajack implant and
begins running on hot decks. By this time, most otaku are the
equals of veteran deckers.
Many candidates stop at this point, leave the community
and go on to become novahot deckers, programmers, and deckmeisters. Others-those who show the deepest, most profoundly Imprinted understanding of the Matrix-undergo an experience which changes them forever. Those who experience the socalled Deep Resonance become capable of interacting with
cyberspace using only an implanted digital/neurological ASIST
converter and their bare brains. These otaku are known among
deckers as technoshamans and cyberadepts.
THE DEEP RESONANCE
Otaku who experience the Deep Resonance are capable of
running the Matrix without cyberdecks. Apparently, the Deep
Resonance transforms the individual, just as an awakening of magical power transforms a latent shaman. In fact, some alleged otaku
who have spoken of this event use terms reminiscent of the totemic
experience of the shaman. Others speak of suddenly perceiving
interlocking energies and formulae, in the manner of a mage.
Both sets of experiences seem to indicate that the otaku forms
a virtually mystical relationship with the Matrix and begins to view
the nets as a living entity. Whatever the reality behind the Deep
Resonance experience may be. It appears to cause permanent neurological change in the otaku that permits "decking"without a
deck. The neural interface of the otaku's implanted datajack begins
to interact with the redundant holographic capacity of the brain as
If it were a bioprocess computer-which, of course, it is,
BUILDING AN OTAKU
Otaku may be of any race. Human otaku must assign Priority
A to Resources, Metahuman otaku must assign Priority B to
Resources, or A if their gamemaster allows the More
Metahumans option (p. 46, SRII).
The otaku character does not receive the usual benefits of
Priority A or B Resources. See Allocating Resources, p. 145,
Magic is Priority E for otaku. There is no known instance of
a magically active otaku. Human otaku assign Priority D to Race,
and must allocate Skills and Attributes berween Priorities B and
C. Metahuman otaku in a standard game must allocate Skills and
Attributes between Priorities C and D.
ALLOCATING ATTRIBUTES
The racial maximums for otaku characters' Mental Attributes
are raised by 1. Reduce racial maximums for Physical Attributes
by 1. These modifications reflect potentials that seem to be
inherent in the children chosen to be otaku.
If a player allocates only | point each to all of the character's
Physical Attributes and halves his racial maximums in those
attributes (round fractions up), he receives 2 extra Attribute
Points to allocate to his Mental Attributes any way he wishes
Also in this case, increase the racial maximums for the character's Mental Attributes by a total of 2 rather than 1. This represents a common pattern among many otaku, whose subnormal
physical development, even disabilities, are coupled with
extremely high IQs and determination
ALLOCATING SHILLS
An otaku must allocate at least 6 and no more than 8 points
to his starting Computer Skill. He may concentrate in Software or
specialize in Decking.
Any Channel skill (see Channels, below) may have a beginning Rating of 6. One other Channel skill may have a Rating 5.
and a third Channel skill may have a Rating 4. The beginning ratings of all remaining Channel skills may not exceed 3.
The only Etiquette skills the otaku may possess when he
enters the game are Matrix and Street.
All these restrictions apply only when creating an otaku
character. Players are free to improve skills during the game to
make the otaku more well-rounded. Remember that most otaku
at the beginning of their careers, are a weird mix of nearly autis
tic street kid and sophisticated techhead-with extremely limited life experiences. These rules are designed to simulate that
profile.
Channels
Otaku learn five special skills that act as operational utilities
when the otaku perform System Tests. These skills, called channels, are named for the five subsystems of Matrix computers
Access, Control, Index, Files, and Slave. Whenever an otaku
makes a required Subsystem Test during a system operation, he
uses the appropriate channel to lower the test target number. For

example. an Analyze Security operation requires a Control Test.
A normal decker could lower the target number for the test with
an analyze utility. An otaku with Control Channel would use the
Control Channel Rating instead.
When creating an otaku character, a player receives a number of points equal to the average of his Mental Attributes
i[Intelligence - Will + Charisma] + 3. round up). He can distrib
ute these points among his channels as he wishes. Regular skill
points can also be used to increase the channel ratings.
Once the otaku character is in the game, the channels can
be Improved like any other skills, using Karma Points.
The basic channels are general skills. Concentrations that
mimic the action of each specific utility exist as well. For example, Control Channel (Analyze) would only be effective when
making Control Tests for System Operations that normally
require ant analyze utility, such as Analyze Host and Analyze IC
operations. Specializations for the otaku channels are limited to
a single operation-Files Channel (Edit File), for example.
ALLOCATING RESOURCES
The high Resource priority for otaku Is dedicated to their skill
benefits, their background, and the toll exacted by the Deep
Resonance experience. Therefore, an otaku character receives
only 5,000 nuyen for additional outfitting, as if his Resources
were Priority D.
PROGRAMMING DAYS
Every otaku receives an allotment of days that he may
spend programming utilities according to the rules for Complex
Forms, below. The allotment equals the character's Computer
Skill multiplied by 3. In addition, he receives the standard oraku
task bonus: (Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) + 4.
The player can allocate these days any way he likes. Any
programs in progress at the start of play can be finished during
the game, as with any incomplete task.
LIVING PERSONA
The Deep Resonance creates the otaku's icon-his living
persona-based on the character's Mental characteristics. The
appearance of the living persona usually follows the customs of
the otaku community where the character was raised.
MPCP: (Intelligence Rating + Willpower Rating + Charisma
Rating) + 3 (round up)
Bod: Willpower Rating
Evasion: Intelligence Rating
Masking: (Willpower Rating + Charisma Rating) = 2 (round up)
Sensor: Intelligence Rating
Response: (Intelligence Rating +Willpower Rating) + 2 (round
up) - 3D6 Initiative
Armor: Willpower Rating
Hardening: Willpower Rating + 2, round up
I/O Speed: Intelligence Rating × 100 Mp
ENHANCED ATTRIBUTES
Cyberware that Improves an otaku's Mental Attribute adds
its effect directly to the living persona's ratings. For example, an
otaku who receives a Cerebral Booster-2 implant would modify
his living persona's ratings to reflect his increased Intelligence
Rating
Improvements to the Mental Attributes bought with Karma
Points raise the living persona's ratings as well.
The aspects of Charisma that operate in the living persona
are self-image and self-confidence. Cosmetic aspects are trivial in
this regard. Therefore, any purely cosmetic enhancements to an
otaku's Charisma Rating, or those aimed at enhancing Social
Skills, do not affect the living persona ratings. For example, tallored pheromones (p. 18, Shadowtech), do not increase an
otaku's living persona ratings.
For reasons yet unknown, magical enhancements do not
affect the living persona. They affect only the otaku's actions in
the physical world.
RESPONSE
An otaku's Reaction Rating in the Matrix is equal to the
average of his Intelligence and Willpower ratings, He receives
3Do for Matrix Initiative.
ARMOR/HARDENING
The living persona's online Armor and Hardening ratings
against gray or black IC are based on the otaku's Willpower Rating.
Both can be raised by creating the appropriate Complex Forms.
COMPLEX FORMS
In addition to the five channels, otaku can "program" versions
of other operational utilities for their own use. The otaku call such.
utilities complex forms. In reality, the otaku does not actually
"program" a complex form-he alters the holographic nerve complexes of his own brain to produce the effects of the program.
In game terms, however, an otaku creating a complex form
follows a five-step process. The steps are: selecting the complex
form rating, paying necessary Karma Points, determining the
complex form size, calculating the base time for carrying out the
task, and then performing the task.
The rating of a complex form may not exceed the otaku's
Computer Skill or an appropriate concentration or specialization
of that skill. After selecting the complex-form rating, the otaku
must pay a number of Karma Points equal to the rating
Next, determine the size of the complex form. The size is
calculated in the same manner as a program size, using the following formula:
(Complex form rating2 x utility multiplier) + (option rating2
+ option multiplier) - size in Mp
The utility multiplier is the multiplier of the operational utility the
complex form mimics. Otaku may also Include options with a
complex form, as indicated in the formula. However, options

such as optimization, squeeze, and other space-savers are neither required nor allowed with complex forms. Remember, the
complex form is not stored on a deck-it's stored in the otaku's
brain. The complex form size is used only to determine the base
time for creating the complex form, not for storage or uploading.
After determining the complex form size, calculate the base
time for the task, using the following formula:
Complex form size x 2 - base time in days
The otaku may reduce the base time by using his otaku task
bonus:
(Intelligence Rating + Charisma Rating) divided by 4 (round
up) - otaku task bonus
The otaku task bonus effectively reduces the number of days
needed to complete the task, just like a standard task bonus (see
Task Bonuses, p. 77 in Deckers, for an explanation of task
bonuses). In addition, an otaku may add I point to his task bonus
by spending a number of Karma Points equal to the complex
form rating. For example, an otaku creating a Rating 7 complex
form could spend 7 Karma Points to increase his task bonus by 1
point. The same otaku could spend 14 Karma Points to Increase
his task bonus by 2 points, and so on. After applying all task
bonuses to the base time, the otaku spends any of his allotted
programming days to perform the task of "programming" the
complex form into his brain.
The base time for upgrading a complex form is calculated in
the same manner as base times for upgrades of standard programs (see Upgrades, p. 107 in Programs), When upgrading a
complex form. the original version of the program keeps working normally until the programming task is completed. At that
time, the form's new rating or features kick in. When upgrading
a form, the otaku must spend a number of Karma Points equal to
the final rating of the upgraded form.
The otaku cannot upgrade his persona or MPCP ratings as
complex forms, because these features are pegged directly to
his Mental Attributes. However, an otaku can upgrade his Armor
and Hardening ratings. The otaku must upgrade based on his
Inherent ratings, For example, if an otaku has Willpower-6, he
has Armor-6 automatically. To upgrade his armor as a complex
form, the otaku must upgrade it to 7 or higher.
SPRITES
The otaku call program frames sprites, and reputedly make
wide use of them. An otaku creates frame cores per standard
rules (see Frames, p. 105 in Programs), Otaku may not use frame
cores created by another individual. Each otaku must create his
own. Additionally, the otaku must spend a number of Karma
Points equal to the frame Core Rating,
After completing a frame core, the otaku can load it with
any complex form he possesses, as well as operational utilities.
The rating of a complex form on the sprite may not exceed the
otaku's own rating in that form. Similarly, the rating of any operational utility loaded onto the sprite may not exceed the otaku's
rating In the corresponding channel. When loading operational
utilities, the otaku follows the standard rules for loading a frame
(see Frames. p. 105, in Programs).
At this point, the otaku has the option of spending a number of Karma Points equal to the sprite's complex form and utility ratings to strengthen the sprite. If the otaku does so, the
sprite becomes temporarily disabled if it crashes. The sprite
remains intact and becomes available again as soon as the otaku
jacks out of the system. If the otaku does not spend these Karma
Points, the sprite is permanently wiped clean if it crashes. The
frame core survives intact, but all complex forms and utilities
must be reloaded.
OTAKU AND THE SOTA
The Deep Resonance experience enables otaku to continuously adapt to changes in the Matrix (some otaku claim that the
Deep Resonance itself causes all change in the Matrix).
Therefore, otaku are always in synch with the SOTA and do not
have to take any action when it advances.
OTAKU AND DAMAGE
The intimate link between the otaku and his living persona
created by the Deep Resonance experience also makes otaku
more vulnerable to damage than standard deckers.
Any damage to an otaku's icon condition monitor also does
damage to the otaku's Mental Condition Monitor, Black IC programs attack the otaku's Physical Condition Monitor, just as black
IC does against normal deckers:
Gray IC is especially dangerous to otaku. If the living persona suffers permanent damage to a Persona Rating, the rating
remains reduced until the otaku can upgrade it back to Its original level-this is the one exception to the rule that otaku can't
program their Persona Ratings. On the other hand, this programming task does not require Karma Points, only time.
Damage to a complex form caused by tar IC or hog programs puts the form out of action until the otaku can jack out.
Complex forms regenerate from such damage at a rate of 1 point
per hour, but do not recover at all if the otaku is suffering from
damage to either his Mental or Physical Condition Monitor, The
otaku must heal Condition Monitor damage before his complex
forms regenerate.
On the upside, an otaku's channels are not vulnerable to tar
IC and hog programs. An otaku can use his control channel all he
likes in the presence of tar baby, and the IC will not react to it.
Additionally, otaku are immune to actual virus codes, such
as worm programs.
PLAYING AN OTAKU
You don't know who birthed you, whether they dumped
you or died on you. Didn't make much difference back there.
Cold and hunger were your heritage, scrounging half-spoiled
stuffers out of trash dumps, hiding from the bigger kids who'd

take them away. From time to time, the word flashed through
your tiny world that the hunters were out, and with the stink of
your fear cutting sharp even through your normal reek, you went
to ground until they were gone. Now you know who they might
have been. The list is long: sweepers for the kiddy shops, organleggers looking for easily Implanted young tissue, "sporting"
folks hunting prey that could run and think and maybe beg for
merey. But there wasn't any mercy back there. Not for anyone.
You survived somehow, Then one day you found a handful
of older kids around your hidey-place. They didn't look like the
kids you knew. Now you know the difference between malnutrition and health, between clean clothes and dirty rags. Back there.
you just knew they looked different. And they talked to you and
brought you here.
They showed you new things and gave you words for them,
They taught you numbers, and what the numbers did. They
taught you a new thing you liked almost better than anything.
You learned it was called friendship.
They gave you your first datajack and showed you how to
use it. Then you discovered the Deep Resonance and began to
learn the channels, the complex forms. the ways of your newfound home-the Matrix:
Playing an otaku means that your character, in all likelihood,
spent his earliest years as an abandoned child in an environment
of extreme poverty-surviving by begging, theft and scrounging, and subject to the predations of some of the worst walking
garbage in the Sixth World. Older otaku recognized the potential to become an otaku in your character and rescued him from
this life. They gave him food, shelter, education, and a sense of
community-the first he ever experienced.
Outside the tribal structure of his otaku community, your
character may be significantly socially handicapped, wholly deficient in social skills, Of course, mental stability has to rank high
in the things otaku look for in new members, or they'd all be
crazy as bedbugs after such severe childhood trauma. But you
aren't going to find an otaku who comes across like a cute kid
from a sitcom, either. Don't expect non-otaku to like your character too much; they're going to think he's weird and they'll
probably make tracks to avoid him whenever possible.
At their best, young otaku are often rude and anti-social,
even by shadowrunner standards. They are arrogant in anything
Involving the Matrix and more than half convinced that nothing
outside the Matrix matters a frag unless it affects their personal
comfort or security. The well-being of fellow otaku in their own
community is important to them. The well-being of other otaku
comes next. Personal friends, if they have any, third, and the rest
of the world a very distant fourth. These priorities may manifest
themselves as Intensely brattish behavior or as cold-blooded
ruthlessness without a trace of what the shrinks call "affect."
Certainly, otaku can grow into more well-rounded human
beings, given friendship. responsibility, even trust, within the
shadow code. But no one is likely to enjoy the company of an
otaku while he matures.
CYBERADEPT OR TECHNOSHAMAN?
Otaku fall into two broad groups: the cyberadepts and the
technoshamans. Both groups exhibit identical abilities, but they
hold different views of the Deep Resonance and their own places
In the world.
Cyberadepts are rationalists, technophiles-perhaps psychologically more attuned to the specific workings of programs
and the organization of data than other otaku. They view their
state as a natural and Inevitable blending of humanity and technology and tend to express their concepts in precise terms,
almost formulae.
Technoshamans see the Matrix as a living being, which they
have learned to blend with spiritually. They are more mystical,
more holistic in their descriptions of computer operations and performance than other otaku. Many technoshamans maintain that
the Deep Resonance proceeds from spirits resident in the Matrix.
If the gamemaster wants to play up these differences in his
games, he may apply the following cyberadept and technoshaman bonuses:
Cyberadepts apply a +1 modifier to the effective rating of
any complex form they learn. They must create the form before
getting this bonus, but it does not affect the size of the form. This
bonus reflects the cyberadepts' particular insight into the details
of Matrix operations.
Technoshamans reduce target numbers by 1 when using
their channels, This bonus reflects their approach to the Matrix as
a gestalt with which they blend.
Players choosing one or the other of these orientations
should roleplay their character accordingly.
MYSTERY OF THE OTAKU
Even the otaku don't know why they experience the Deep
Resonance. The technoshamans of the Denver Nexus claim that
the work of Shiva and the other sysops who maintain the Nexus
has somehow created a cyberspace where they, the true children
of the Matrix, see deeper into its truths than the old-tech
dinosaurs. Some of them believe that true Spirits of the Matrix
exist in this environment. Others claim the Deep Resonance is an
actual evolutionary step, and that cyberadepts are the next step
in the long march from the first hominids.
Among non-otaku. even wilder theories abound. Some
older elves agree with the technoshamans that a Great Spirit has
learned to manifest in the Matrix, native to the Matrix the way
other nature spirits are native to their domains. A very experienced decker in Seattle advanced the theory, before he disappeared, that the Virus of 2029 had evolved Into a cybernetic lifeform, as homo sapiens evolved from the primal goo of Earth's
earliest seas, and that it was helping the children of the Matrix
evolve into a form similar to its own. A top-secret report to the
board of Aztechnology suggests the existence of a super-Al
somewhere in cyberspace, which is now functioning independently and using the otaku as its agents. Hard to say what else

the author thought. She committed suicide a few days after submitting the final draft of her report, which her superiors dismissed as the work of an unbalanced mind. A reporter in Berlin
left partial notes suggesting that aliens from outer space were
taking up residence in the Matrix and grooming earth children as
a conquering army of netsoldiers. His editors considered running
the story after the traffic accident. but couldn't find the rest of his
files, so they spiked it instead.
Given this track record, other folks with theories about the
technoshamans and cyberadepts may be playing it smart by
keeping quiet.
Regardless of these differing explanations, the experience of
the Deep Resonance follows certain patterns. Technoshamans
report a sudden transport to a place unlike any in their Matrix or
physical experience. Here they encounter a being, or beings.
who give them the seed knowledge that grows into their ability
in the Matrix. Cyberadepts, on the other hand, claim that they
know they are still in the Matrix, but perceive connections and
networks of dataflow that transcend the interface of the deck.
Both emerge from the experience with the abilities described in
this text. Sometimes they enter these states again, and when
they return they have gained new abilities or received a mission
which they must carry out.
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?
Good question. Those who may know are not saying.
Sometimes otaku undertake specific missions, which they claim
-come from the Deep Resonance. These missions can be trivial or
major. Trivial missions include ensuring the delivery of programs
to specific places at specific times, the kind of low-level gigs that
secure courier services usually handle. Major missions have
Involved preventing certain corporations from achieving specific
goals: neutralizing, or killing magicians Involved in certain
research or cooking the research files to sabotage the projects:
and preventing (or ensuring) certain deaths-either apparent
accidents or deliberate assassinations.
Often, otaku on a mission seem devoid of anything a human
would recognize as compassion. But in the main, otaku missions
turn out to be for the benefit of liberty and of humanity at large.
once the patterns become discernible-as if they were dictated
by some source that perceives the interplay of seemingly unrelated, even trivial, events in the world community bound together by the Matrix. The real Ghost in the Machine? Or children
playing at deity with powers that their elders cannot control?
Despite the information on the otaku that exists, far more
remains unknown about these individuals. If some type of guiding
force exists behind the otaku, why has it chosen an army of children with virtually no experience of life outside the Matrix? And
why the different experiences of the technoshamans and cyberadepts? What could cause changes in the human neural net that
2 1st-century geneticists cannot understand, let alone replicate?
Perhaps future explorers of that strange universe called the
Matrix may one day find answers to such questions.

we've got a great deal on resort homesteads in the Jersey Toxic
Zone for you. Ares engineers its systems for maximum dataflow
overview. Transaction packets and data streams transmitted
between individual hosts in a local net must pass through heavily loaded chokepoints. The working mainframes themselves are
relatively IC-free, which promotes maximum efficiency, while
the chokepoints provide the focal point for Ares data security ..
The Regional Sales complex shown here is a tiered system
that opens onto the public grid through Host A, an open-access
Green system where Ares displays promotional sims and nonclassified product data files to clients. Hidden behind the
salesroom is the chokepoint labeled Host B. This guards the
more sensitive systems but doesn't carry any paydata itself. Host
B is the hub for Hosts CI through C4: Accounting. Tech Support,
Sales Management and Maintenance, respectively. Both CI and
C2 provide gateways to the area-PLTG backbone. Hosts C1
through C3 provide some useful paydata.
C4. the Maintenance area, includes most of the slave nodes a
team would need on a ground insertion into the office building.
The real hot stuff-exec data files, secure e-mail and the security
slave nodes-take up space on Host D, networked to C4.
Other valuable Ares hosts may be located and accessed
through the PLTG.

Host A is designed as a standard office/salesroom
metaphor mixed with UMS iconography, so pedestrian it doesn't count as sculpture. Any reality filter will automatically dominate Host A. Deckers searching for paydata find only some
entertaining sims (the military hardware ones are terrific) and
catalog entries for Ares products of all kinds.
Viewing sales files and promos does not require an operation or affect the security tally. Any decker with a credstick to
slot, drawing on a legit account or a certified balance, can order
any Ares product through this host, just like a customer who
logged on legally. Getting an order accepted without paying
would require a run into Host CI to insert a false payment record
into the Accounting database.
The Access subsystem contains a dedicated port to Host B.

The C systems all have identical software, including the IC,
but the sculpture on each one is different. Passive IC on a C host,
including Trace, will shut down when a decker logs off that host.
Active IC will pursue the decker to another part of the C network
and onto Host B. Security tallies remain in effect on any C host.
For example, if a decker accumulates a Security Tally of 4 on CI,
logs back onto Host B, and later in the same run logs back onto
CI. his tally picks up at 4.
The sculpture on CI is standard office decor at first blush, but
the helpful secretarial icons are all tuned up to cutting-edge, male
fashion model dress and good looks. The supervisory programs
are all female. It's heavily seated sculpture, subtle but solld. A
decker would be well advised to load a top-line, fem-exec look if
he decides to "dress" his MPCP for a run into this system.
The CI metaphor dates from when Regina O'Meara edged
out Ted Harcourt as the local head of accounting. Harcourt had
mandated pornsim queens as the main iconography for the server programs when he was in charge. Modesty prevents us from
describing the way they'd acknowledge a successful access, but
some deckers used to log-on and open absolutely worthless files
just for the experience.
The metaphor on C2 is an old-style amusement park, The
roller coaster is the Index access to all the low-security files.
Deckers swoop and scream until they reach the right datastore.
then the car JUMPS off the tracks and salls through the air Into
the file area.
The high-security spec files follow a fun-house motif.
The gateways to the PLTG are in the Access subsystems on
both CI and C2. Scramble IC protects both SANs. so a decker
needs to perform a successful Decrypt operation in order to logon to the PLTG.
C3 uses a standard office motif, though it does count as a
sculpted system,
Techno-flash control panels showing readouts on the building environmentals, the elevators and plumbing fill C4-everything's here except security sensors and alarms, which are resident on Host D. The client servers use well-sculpted custom
iconography consisting of shiny robots with goofy smiles pasted
on their faces. The rest is mostly UMS iconography. The trap door
to Host D rotates randomly through all the subsystems nanosecond by nanosecond, and so a decker must search for it every
time he needs to find it.

FEDERAL RECORDS
If a decker has a death wish, he might as well use it constructively. Raiding any of the federal offices in Seattle or elsewhere can be very profitable-unless you crack black dataspace
and get fried.
The diagram above illustrates the typical setup to be found
In almost any UCAS office outside of DeeCee (the systems in the

capital are much, much nastier), This is a non-secure system, one
that connects to the grid. High-security sites like the IRS, FBI and
black military systems keep their most secret data on machines
that have no grid connection. The systems that need an occasional chat with the outside world maintain heavily defended
connections to the government PLTG.
Host A Blue-4/8/10/9/9/B
Paydata: 2
Paydata Density: 2D6 x 20
Host A represents public dataspace. It might be the system
that SIN-holders on public assistance access to collect benefits,
or where a citizen logs on to renew a license, register a complaint, or otherwise interact with the feds. These hosts don't offer
much improvement on the physical offices used in the preMatrix bureaucracies: long walt cycles, the most boring iconog
raphy on the grid, and surly I/O from clerical operators and
expert systems.
The look and feel of Host A on a standard bureaucratie network
Is plain UMS, with a particularly stodgy quality that might as well
be part of government requirement specifications, it's so prevalent.
Paydata exists here only in big, bulky packages-the almostpublic records concerning business transacted on the host that are
bound to be somehow valuable to somebody out there ..
Slave systems here are pretty trivial, controlling lights, air
conditioning and other amenities for the physical office where
the local bureaucrats operate.

counts as Passive IC for Increasing the security

Host B handles the day-to-day office activities for the site. A
welfare office would keep records of recipients, payments, medical programs, and so on. A licensing operation would store
records of permits issued, citations or violations, and so on.
If a decker is looking for specific material, rather than random paydata, this would be the place to go for private files
stored (illegally) by low-level government workers. If the decker
wants to riffe confidential (but not particularly secret) files-say.
the service record of a particular employee-those records
would be on Host B as well. Secure files connected to the operation of the office would be on Host D.

in an adventure are stored on Host D. The host also contains the

here, but if they have been online more than a few hours, they will
also have been distributed to high-security databanks (Red-Hard systems) through the PLTG. Erasing or modifying such records would
involve an extremely dangerous run through the government grid,

About Government Deckers
The following guidelines for government deckers also apply
to corp deckers, or any decker retained to defend a system. The
gamemaster may design an NPC decker of his own, but may use
the following rules if he needs a quick-and-dirty decker character.
Government deckers may be defined as Inferior, Equal, or
Superior opponents. An Inferior opponent has an MPCP Rating 2
points below that of the player-character decker. A Superior opponent has an MPCP Rating 2 points higher. An Equal opponent has
an MPCP Rating-and everything else-equal to the player-character decker's. Similarly, an Inferior opponent has a Response
Increase 1 point lower than the player-character decker's, and a
Superior opponent's Response Increase is one point higher.
Persona programs for all government deckers are at their
maximum. As a decker's total Persona Ratings cannot exceed 3
x MPCP and four programs make up a standard persona, the rating for each persona program ends up being three-fourths of the
MPCP. rounded down. Government and corp deckers running
without a Masking program have ratings equal to the MPCP for
each persona program.
All utilities are at maximum value-equal to the MPCP rating. Inferior opponents should rarely. If ever, have utilities with
options. Superior opponents should have programs with a little
something special, at the gamemaster's discretion. An Equal
opponent's utilities depend on the player-character decker-if
the player character is loaded for bear, so is his opponent.
These NPCs usually carry Armor, Attack. Cloak, and LockOn. They may also carry one or more utilities that attack Persona
Ratings, especially if their job includes "softening up" the intruder for attacks by IC. Inferior opponents carry no self-repair programs. Superior opponents carry Medic and Restore. Equal
opponents match the player-character decker's capabilities.
On systems where deadly force might reasonably be
expected, any NPC decker may be armed with black hammer or
killjoy. Government deckers are especially likely to carry track
programs, as part of their department's job is to enforce Matrix
law in the real world as well as on the grid.
These deckers use Legitimate icons on the hosts they
defend, and so IC will not attack them. To attack these opponents, the intruding decker must use the appropriate target number to hit Legitimate Icons (see Cybercombat, p. 123),

To design a typical host, select the desired Security Rating and Intrusion Difficulty, then make the appropriate dice rolls to determine the Security Value and Subsystem Ratings. The Paydata Allocation Table provides formulas for determining Paydata Points and data
density of the host, Density may be rolled in advance or when the decker locates the paydata and Is ready to download it.
