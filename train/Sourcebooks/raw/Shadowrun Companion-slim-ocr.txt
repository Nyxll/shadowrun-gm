The Shadowrun Companion takes players through the life of
a shadowrunner, from character creation to character retirement.
The Character Creation section expands and clarifies the character creation system presented in SRII and adds variations on that
system, including a point-based approach to character generation.
This section also introduces Edges and Flaws, a strategy that offers
a wide variety of personality traits to help players make each character unique and that also can affect game play. In addition,
Character Creation provides rules for playing a shapeshifter player character and introduces new metahuman variants.
Because the Shadowrun game system bases the outcome of
most actions on the successful use of skills, the Skills and Training
section offers a revised Skill Web designed with a more consistent
internal logic, and explains what aspects of the web were
changed and why. This section also clarifies and expands the skill
defaulting rules. Rules for training provide a system for learning
new skills and improving old ones in a more realistic way.
Player-character contacts have always been an Important but
under-used part of the Shadowrun universe. Contacts and
Enemies suggests ways to expand the role of these non-player
characters, from creating NPC personalities to exploring the distinction between what a contact knows and what he's willing to
reveal, to staying on a contact's good side and maintaining confidentiality. Players also can network their contacts through Friends
of Friends, an option that adds new depth to characters' sources
for information. This section also describes several non-traditional
contacts, including the Shadowland BBS. Contacts and Enemies
provides rules for creating enemies, non-player characters with a
more sinister reason for interacting with player characters, and
tips for how to effectively present such NPCs in the game.
The Advanced Rules section offers new uses and optional
rules for Karma, the first change to those rules since the release of
Shadowrun, Second Edition. These variations include the lifesaving Hand of God rule, favors and markers, and guidelines for
character advancement in an amoral (Karma-less) campaign. This
section also offers advanced rules for tailoring the way magic
functions: a system for creating workable statistics for famous
NPCs, threats and other opponents of shadowrunners; state-ofthe-art rules, which allow gamemasters to control the technology
curve in their campaigns: and a few often-requested options for
familiar rules.
Running the Game offers gamemasters a framework and outline to use in designing their own scenarios, adventures and campaigns. Alternate Campaign Concepts shows gamemasters how to develop and run alternative campaign archetypes and includes
examples of player character groups such as Doc Wagon EMTs
and Lone Star teams. This section also provides rules for creating
street gangs and designing gang-member characters, suggests
campaign hooks for drawing street gangs into a Shadowrun
game, and describes five Seattle gangs in detail to demonstrate
the possibilities of running gang story lines.
FILLING IN THE BLANKS
To those of you who have been playing the game since its
inception, for FASA to produce a rules companion six years after
the initial rules were published might seem like a step backward.
It's entirely likely that the bulk of the material in this book covers
aspects of the game that you currently ignore or for which you
long ago made up house rules, or that all your questions have
been answered at a Shadowrun seminar at a convention. You may
feel a bit disappointed that this book is not filled with new rules:
you might even have been hoping for Shadowrun, Third Edition.
We sympathize with your feelings. Quite frankly, the difficulty of
producing a successful companion book to the basic rules of a
game is that a companion book should respond to player questions and comments in a useful, effective way-and it's hard to
decide when to stop compiling information and actually publish a
response.
In the years since the publication of the second edition of
Shadowrun, we have noticed an increase in general questions
about the basics of playing, running and having fun with the
Shadowrun game, from both new and veteran players. Instead of
asking about the complexity of using the metaplanes, advanced
Matrix design or the mysteries of cybermancy, Shadowrun players wanted more information about character creation, Karma.
how to sustain a campaign, the uses of skills and contacts-the
basic concepts of the game.
With any game system and universe, especially one as rich as
Shadowrun, the tendency is to make each book more significant.
bigger, filled with more toys-to up the ante, push the envelope,
keep the fans entertained and always give them something new
and exciting. Each product needs to outshine the previous offering. While that kind of one-upmanship keeps us on our toes and
constantly improves the product we produce, it also means that
we sometimes forget to answer the players' basic questions. The
number of players and gamemasters asking for advice about
exactly what they are supposed to do with this diverse, intriguing
universe prompted us to reevaluate our plan for The Shadowrun
Companion. We feel confident that the result will satisfy the players asking those questions.
Even if you have already found a way to fill in the blanks left
by published Shadowrun products, we believe you will find
new, interesting and fun concepts in this book. As always,
gamemasters should modify, adapt or rework these rules as necessary to accommodate their groups' style of play. Because all
the rules in The Shadowrun Companion are considered to be
optional, gamemasters and players should agree on which rules
they will use before incorporating any of these concepts into
their games. The goal of The Shadowrun Companion is to make
playing Shadowrun even more enjoyable; do whatever it takes
to make your game fun!

This section provides suggestions designed to help Shadowrun players
generate a wide range of interesting, fully realized and fun-to-play runner
characters. In addition to options for varying the character creation system, this section provides optional rules for creating shapeshifter characters and for playing additional metatype variants.
THE CONCEPT
Who do you want to play? This is the most Important question to
answer before you begin to create your character, because your character
can Incorporate almost anything you can imagine. You can model your
character after a figure in a movie, book or play; after someone you know personally or an individual currently In the news; after a historical or mythic figure; or even
after yourself-the choices are endless.
Think about what sort of person you might enjoy "being" when you game-a
fresh-faced Innocent just out of Corpville, a jaded street punk who's been rolling
people for food his whole life, a disillusioned hard-boiled ex-cop, and so on. What
motivates your character-does she simply lust after money? Does he want to bring
The Revolution to the oppressed people of the Sixth World? Is she a psychopath
who loves mindless violence? Does he just want to get by?

Tara's been reading lately about the Navy Sea.
Air and Land Special Forces (SEALs), and has
developed a lot of respect for their rough combat training. She wonders how a SEAL would
fare in the Shadowrun world and thinks she'd
enjoy playing a former SEAL gone mercenary.
Tara figures that a SEAL team in 2057 would
include Matrix experts and magicians as well as
more conventional warriors, so she decides her
character is a former SEAL decker-she likes the
idea of being a computer nerd with enough
training and attitude to whup razorpunks.
MORE THAN AN ARCHETYPE
Like most roleplaying games. Shadowrun tends to force
players to spend an inordinate amount of time calculating their
characters' game statistics. Agonizing over Attribute choices, trying to squeeze maximum efficiency out of every Skill Point and
deliberating for hours over the purchase of each piece of equipment, players put a lot of effort into designing lean, mean fighting (or decking, or spellcasting or driving) machines. Finally, they
push the mountain of sourcebooks and scrap paper aside and
proudly present a completed character sheet to the gamemaster,
who looks it over and asks, "So, what's this guy like?"
"Uh, well," the player says, "he's a street samurai, you know? Um
kind of tough, fearless, honorable ... you know, a street samurai."
Or. "She's a typical decker, kind of geeky, really cocky about
her decking skills and nervous about everything else."
Or. "My cat shaman? He's, uh ... (sound of pages flipping) ...
'stealthy, vain, cunning and sometimes cruel." Yeah, that's it."
Why are so many players willing to spend so much time on
their characters' guns, gear and statistics, but so little on their personalities? Combat may be exciting, but players could certainly
experience the same vicarious thrill of blowing things up by visiting the local video arcade. Roleplaying games offer much more
than the thrill of combat. They allow players to take on roles, to
become actors in stories of their own creation. That's why the
basic concept of a character is Important. Background, motivation,
personality-these things make characters interesting. And the
more interesting and distinctive you make your role, the more
you-and everyone else in your game group-will enjoy play.
A character's place in a team of shadowrunners is determined
by his personality at least as much as his abilities. Characters who
bear striking similarities in game terms may be wildly different in
outlook and effectiveness, depending on their personalities and
the way their players portray them. Consider one of the most basic
character types, the "guy with lots of combat-oriented cyberware." The Shadowrun core rules alone offer four variants on this
basic theme: the street samurai, bodyguard, former company man
and mercenary. All these characters possess several of the same
important elements: wired reflexes, smartlinks, excellent physical
stats and at least one Big Gun. In fact, you could substitute the
street samurai statistics for any of the other characters' statistics,
and the change would make very little difference. So what distinguishes these characters from each other? Each follows a different
mindset, takes a different approach to the world.
The street samurai is an urban predator who balances honor,
loyalty and reputation against the need to survive on the mean
streets. The bodyguard is trained to take a bullet for her client. Her
primary goals may change as she runs the shadows, but she's still
willing to put her life on the line to achieve her objective. Unlike
the samurai, however, she won't die for honor. The former company man may have left his company behind, but he's still as hard
as he has to be to get the job done and survive. If that means taking someone out, he'll do it in a heartbeat. Maybe he'll regret it
later, but that's the biz, sweetheart. The mercenary has two goals:
earn her nuyen and stay alive to spend it. Sure, she'll take risks,
but only when necessary. Every step of the way, she has her eyes
fixed firmly on the bottom line. She may agree with your cause or
your politics, but she never works for free.
It is these personality differences-not the archetype name at
the top of the page, not the game statistics-that distinguish
these four similar character types. The preceding examples offer
only the broadest, most stereotypical characterizations, but even
these bare-bones personality outlines provide better characterbuilding frameworks than statistics alone.
So when you create your next new character, try spending
some extra time on the twenty questions posed on pages 47-48
of Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRII). You may want to add more
detail to your character's background as he or she develops a
stronger, more distinct personality during gaming sessions, but
these guidelines offer enough of a framework to give you, your
group and your gamemaster a few strong "hooks" to make your
character come alive. Regardless of which questions you choose
to answer for your character, ask yourself why the character made
each decision. Why did your former wage mage leave her cushy
research job to run the shadows, where she gets to sleep in coffin motels and dodge bullets? Why did your decker sink his entire
life's savings into a single, three-pound hunk of electronics? Why
did your street shaman choose the path of Gator? (Here's a hint:
the correct answer is not. "To get +2 dice for Combat and
Detection spells.")
START WITH THE STORY
Players can take the concept of story-based character creation
one step further by designing the character's background before
determining his or her statistics. Rather than beginning the character-creation process by saying, "I want to play a rigger," and then
designing a background that fits the abilities you want him or her to
have, create the character's background first and select his or her
game abilities based on the character's life story. The following
example shows how two runners based on the same premise can
develop into very different characters through their backgrounds.
Imagine that you want your character to be a female human
rigger who developed an interest in vehicles at an early age. The
logical place to start is by determining how a young kid might get
involved with vehicles in the first place. Suppose that Character A
is the daughter of a high-ranking corporate military officer, and
was fascinated by the t-birds and helicopters she saw every time
she visited her father's base. At home, she spent most of her free
time playing flight-sim games and watching military vids. When
she took her corporate aptitude tests, she rated in the top percentiles for vehicular skills, spatial visualization and electronics,
thus making her a prime candidate for the corp's Airborne branch.
With her father's blessing, she entered corporate military training.
Character B, on the other hand, grew up on the mean streets
of the Barrens. For her own protection she joined her brother's gogang, where she had to learn to ride-and fight-to stay alive.
The go-gang did the occasional minor job for a local yakuza clan,
and Character B's raw talent and hunger for success soon caught
the attention of the oyabun. He recruited her to run low-priority
errands for the clan, and her solid performance eventually led him
to rely on her for jobs requiring greater levels of responsibility and
trust. After a year or two, the yakuza recruited Character B as a
low-level soldier.
Once you establish the foundation for the background, consider some of the early changes the character may have undergone. For example, every would-be rigger eventually needs to
acquire some cyberware, if only a vehicle control rig. Turning
points such as these offer good opportunities to explore your
character's thoughts and motivations. How does your character
feel about having a computer implanted into her brain? Character
A would probably feel few qualms about such a step: working in
a high-tech environment, surrounded by experts with easy access
to all the top-notch cyberware they need to do their jobs, she
would probably be eager to go under the laser and jump-start her
career. Character B, on the other hand, might well dread having
the rig implanted. But if the yakuza-at this point, her only route
out of the gutter-made it clear that her continued employment
depended on her accepting cyberware, she might feel compelled
to undergo the surgery despite her fears. As a result, she might
never really embrace her tech and perhaps even refuse to consider further implants.
After creating your character's early life story, decide how
your character became a shadowrunner. Character A, for example,
would need a pretty dramatic reason to turn against the corporate
world of her youth. Perhaps her father refused to follow an order
that he morally opposed, and corporate officials court-martialed
him and ousted him from the ranks in disgrace. Or perhaps another corp tried to "recruit" him, and his parent corporation killed him
rather than let him defect. Either event would shock and disillusion Character A, and she might well turn to the streets out of bitterness and a desire for revenge.
Character B, on the other hand, grew up close to the shadows as part of the go-gang, and her stint as a yakuza courier kept
her on the street. Perhaps running against the corps was a natural reaction when a corporate strike team wiped out her brother's
gang in response to some petty vandalism or as a distraction for
some covert operation. Her decision to run the shadows might
just as easily be a result of heavy recruitment by shadowrunner
friends or a misguided belief that living the "glamorous" life of a
shadowrunner represents a move up in the world. Character B's
presence in the shadows takes on a completely different dimension if the yakuza did not approve of her choice.
Now that you've figured out how your character ended up in
the shadows, you can go to the rulebook and build her statistics.
The most logical allocation for Character A would be Priority A for
Resources, Priority B to Skills and Priority C for Attributes, She
would probably be carrying a substantial amount of military cyberware, most likely Including a headware radio, crypto circuit and
similar communications gear. Her skills would focus on militarystyle helicopters, planes, drones and t-birds and include Tactics
and perhaps Leadership, but only minimal self-defense skills,
because she wasn't trained to operate outside her vehicle. Her primary contacts would be corporate and military.
Priorities for Character B. the ex-go-ganger, might sensibly be
distributed as Attributes A, Resources B and Skills C. The only cyberware she might have is the vehicle control rig, with perhaps a spur.
smartlink or other personal defense cyberware to help protect her
on the streets. Her Vehicle Skills would center on cars and motorcycles, based on minimal exposure to larger and more expensive
vehicles. She would, however, possess better personal defense skills
than Character A, because she grew up depending on herself rather
than her squadmates for protection. Her contacts would include
gang, yakuza, and other street-level people and organizations.
After selecting your character's game statistics, you can
define her personality, based on her life history. This may not
seem important, but your character's personality will determine
how she acts and reacts to different situations. For example,
Character A's military background would probably give her a disciplined, by-the-book mentality-she might even be a bit too
strait-laced and rigid at times. As a runner, she would want clearly defined objectives, and would probably be reluctant to change
objectives in mid-run. She would likely have little tolerance for
looting. inter-team bickering and other unprofessional behaviorshe would expect the other team members to show the same professional discipline that she does. She would also be ready to
either give or follow orders.
Character B's unsupervised childhood on the streets would
likely leave her independent, strong-willed and stubborn. Though
less disciplined than Character A. Character B would be more flexible, able to adapt to changing situations on the fly. She would be
far less likely than Character A to wait patiently in the van piloting
drones while the run takes place.
THE SKY'S THE LIMIT
The background-first approach to character creation illustrates one of the basic strengths of the Shadowrun character system-it is not limited by character classes. While other roleplaying games provide distinct sets of character classes that can be
combined only in a limited number of ways, the players' own
imaginations are the only limits in the Shadowrun character creation system. In the preceding example, Character A combines
aspects of the rigger, former company man and former military
officer archetypes, while Character B adds parts of the ganger
archetype to her rigger nature. Because Shadowrun characters
are not limited by class, they can have any sort of skill or ability
that players want and gamemasters allow. In fact, the best
Shadowrun characters, like the most interesting people, combine
many different "roles" to create a well-rounded whole.
The archetypes in the Shadowrun, Second Edition (SRII)
rulebook and supplements represent some of the major types of
characters in the game world. They are examples, nothing more.
They allow inexperienced players to jump into the game and start

SOMETHING TO CONSIDER
Gamemasters determine
every character's relationship to
the rest of the Shadowrun
world once a game begins, so
players and their gamemasters
should work together when
players create new characters.
Cooperation helps prevent players from surprising gamemasters with character elements
they may not want in their
games, and lessens the chances
that a gamemaster will disallow
a character that one of his players has created.
having fun without spending a lot of time on character creation,
but they are essentially one-dimensional characters-which usually makes them less interesting than complex characters created by
players. So don't hesitate to go beyond the archetypes and familiar stereotypes when creating Shadowrun characters-variety is
the spice of life, and a unique, rich character will make the game
more fun for everyone.
Consider, for example, the possibilities of a detective character who also happens to be a mage, like the character in
Awakenings. Think about the potential of a secret-seeking Snake
shaman who's also a newsfax reporter, a Shark adept hit man, or
maybe a decker who enjoys his Three Musketeers reality filter so
much that he actually becomes a competent swordsman. Let your
imagination run wild. An imaginative background story opens up
a multitude of possible combinations-and it's more fun than simply designing a character around a particular set of abilities.
The background-first method of character design can also
suggest dozens of adventure hooks you can use to involve your
characters in games. Say your group includes a mage who has a
kid sister, for example. The seemingly ordinary corporate extraction that your group just got involved in may seem a lot more
interesting if the targeted biotechnical engineer also happens to
be working on a cure for the mysterious disease that's killing the
mage's kid sister. Or maybe your playing group contains a street
shaman who has claimed an area of the Barrens as his own little
urban protectorate. When a megacorp buys the area and the
wreckers move in to make way for new condos, will the shaman
fight to defend his turf or try to move "his people" out? Will the
other characters on his team help him?
These types of adventures can provide a refreshing change of
pace from the usual fixer-generated jobs and give player characters a chance to affect their game world more directly. By creating rich backgrounds for their characters, players don't have to
rely on their gamemasters alone to come up with interesting runs.
The personalities and motives of the characters themselves and
the events of their lives can spawn adventures and help foster
more varied, less predictable play.
THE NUMBERS
After determining the personality and background of a character, the player must translate the character's traits into game statistics. The first step is to assign one each of five priorities to five
different categories that describe the character. This section illustrates the finer points of assigning priorities.
The Master Character Creation Table also appears on p. 47, SRII.
The Shadowrun character-creation system enables players to
assign priorities to five areas: Race, Magic. Attributes, Skills and
Resources. Assigning a high priority to Magic and/or Race opens
up a wide range of possibilities for roleplaying and offers both the
player and the gamemaster a point of reference for story lines and
character motivations. Attributes, Skills and Resources have the
most impact on how well your character performs his job on a
shadowrunning team.
The priority you assign to Attributes, Skills or Resources
affects your character's ability to survive it all, do it well or have it
all. The higher your base Attributes, the better your character's
survivability. The more Skill Points he or she begins with, the better your character is at what you want him or her to accomplish.
The higher the starting Resources, the more equipment and other
goodies your character can have to do his or her job.
For example, a character with Priority A in Attributes begins
the game with high enough Attribute values to have an excellent
chance of surviving whatever the gamemaster throws at him-by
virtue of Quickness. Strength and Intelligence, among other qualIties-and substantial default values for skills he may lack. Giving
the character Priority B in Attributes only means the character is
more likely to have average Attribute values, which will still serve
to keep him or her alive long enough to improve.
If you assign Priority A to Skills, you can give your character a
wider range of options. For example, you can give your character
multiple skills at an average level, producing a well-rounded character with an impressive variety of solid skills. This approach works
well when designing deckers or riggers, who need a greater number of skills to do their jobs effectively. If you assign Priority B to
Skills, you can give your character fewer skills but at a higher rating.
effectively creating a specialist such as a fighter or magic-user.

When determining what priority to assign to Resources,
players must balance their desire to give their characters every
neat toy in the game against the realities of encumbrance: how
many guns and other weapons can one man or woman really use
at once? Because deckers and riggers need a certain amount of
expensive equipment to function effectively in the game. players
designing those types of characters may want to assign Priority A
to Resources. For any other type of character, Priority B in
Resources offers enough starting cash to buy most necessary
equipment, pay for a decent lifestyle and subscribe to a
DocWagon health-insurance program.
Tara figures a SEAL decker would need to
make both Matrix and Physical Skills a high priority, and would need hefty resources to acquire
serious cyberware and an expensive cyberdeck.
Tara decides to give Skills Priority A (40 points).
Resources Priority B (400,000 nuyen), Attributes
Priority C (20 points), Race Priority D (human)
and Magic Priority E (magic and the Matrix generally don't mix well). This is the same mix of priorities as the former company man archetype (p.
55. SRII), but Tara plans to give her decker a
totally different feel than that archetype.
RACE AND MAGIC
Being a member of a metahuman race or a magic user has a
big impact on any character, and any metahuman or magic-using
character's background should reflect that impact. If you're playing
such a character, think about how these conditions affect your character's life. Ask yourself, when did the character realize that he was
different from most other people? Was the character born in a predominantly human town, or in Seattle's ork community? If the character is a mage or shaman, how does he or she view magic? Is he
experiencing Drain because channeling energy has burned him out
or because his totem thinks he shouldn't be casting powerballs so
often? Are his Killing Hands really the hate of his ancestors focused
on his enemies? The answers to these types of questions help determine how your character works in the game.
ATTRIBUTES
A character's Attributes-Body, Quickness, Strength,
Charisma, Intelligence and Willpower-represent the raw material that makes up every person: his or her body, what the character has done with that body, and what's inside the person that
makes him or her unique. Because Attributes can be improved
during the course of a character's life, they represent something
more than genetics.
The Body Attribute determines a character's resistance to
outside forces. It represents the character's cardiovascular fitness
and endurance, immune system, how well he heals, how well he
adjusts to bioware, his tolerance for drugs and alcohol, and, to
some extent, his muscle and bone structure and weight. Low
Body could mean a character is skinny and frail-boned, or has bad
eating and health habits. A character recovering from a nasty disease or extensive cyberware surgery might have low Body as
well. High Body means a character is better fed, tough as nails,
has strong bones with some spring to them and an immune system that won't quit.
Quickness represents a character's motor reflexes, balance.
metabolism, running speed, flexibility and coordination. A character with low Quickness might be a trid potato, have an inner ear disturbance, or might simply have a tendency to freeze up in emergency situations. High Quickness means that a character has developed fluidity and grace, perhaps through a regimen of running,
martial arts or even typing (which builds up manual dexterity).
Strength denotes what a character's muscles can do.
Strength is somewhat dependent on a character's size and
metatype. If your character is a 5-foot-tall, 115-pound human girl.
she's unlikely to possess an unaugmented Strength Attribute of 6.
On the other hand, dwarfs have a muscle density that rivals that
of reptiles (to reflect this, starting dwarf characters receive a +2
Strength bonus). Characters with low Strength may be small, skinny or slight, or simply too busy to work out. A high-Strength character may be tough and wiry, know how to use her body to her
best advantage, work out every day, or simply be fraggin' BIG.
Charisma is a nebulous Attribute. More than just looks.
Charisma represents a character's self-image, ego, willingness to
find out what people want and give it to them, and ability to recognize what he can and can't get out of people. A whiny
demeanor, a me-first attitude, or an inability to read body language or subtle hints are just a few traits that can give a character
low Charisma. A character with high Charisma might simply enjoy
entertaining others, may honestly want to help people and develop friendships, or may be all flash and fun with whomever it is
today. A high-Charisma character might deliver jokes at the right
moment, have a sexy way of carrying herself, or command
respect because her timing is always impeccable.
Intelligence represents a character's perceptual and analytical abilities, memorizing ability and raw brain power. It denotes
how fast a character learns, adapts or remembers. Low
Intelligence does not mean stupidity; instead, it might denote a
character who discounts things too quickly rather than seeing how
he might use them. Such a character may not think beyond the
moment, may be easily distracted, or may simply rely on instinct
rather than intellect. High Intelligence, on the other hand, means
a character can keep track of several things at once, Integrate old
memories with whatever he's working on now, and apply general principles to specific problems. Such characters learn fast-they
may not have gone to school for years and years, but if someone
competent explains something to them, they'll get it.
Willpower keeps a character going when he wants to give
up, or enables him to control his habits and emotions. Willpower
determines whether or not a character is going to take charge of
his life. A character with low Willpower might defer to other people when big decisions are being made, for example. A highWillpower character is more assured and possesses a never-saydie streak. Such characters go down to the monowire because
that's exactly the fragging point.

Tara is juggling the numbers on her SEAL
decker, whom she's named Erde "Virgil"
Lemarck. With only 20 Attribute Points, Virgil
isn't quite the hoop-kickin" dude Tara originally
envisioned. After distributing those points, Virgil
has Body 3. Quickness 4, Strength 3, Charisma 1.
Intelligence 5 and Willpower 4. Tara justifies
these low numbers by deciding that Virgil is
leaving the military to chase money-big-time.
He plans to sell some "borrowed" military passcodes to an organized crime group-but he
doesn't know any. yet.
As play begins, the other PCs are going to find
Virgil a bitter decker who's spending most of his
life in the Matrix rather than the real world, letting his fine-tuned body slip down to normal
standards and wasting his self-image and enthusiasm. But he's no wash-out: he's smart, and
he's got enough guts to go on a life-risking shadowrun. His Charisma is in the toilet, but only
because he's uncommunicative with people he
doesn't know, such as the other runners. He is
still a team player, and with a little good fortune
and some encouraging successes, he can turn
into a serious runner with some valuable skills,
contacts and hardware.
SKILLS
Skills represent the abilities your character has worked for and
learned. So how did your character get them? Why does he concentrate on or specialize in certain skills-or why doesn't he? Car
6 is great for a rigger, but It means your character can drive a big
rig just as well as a passenger vehicle-where'd he learn to do
that? When you create a character, go through each of your character's skills and think of a short explanation of why and how he
or she learned it.
For a real-world example of what the skill rating scale means,
let's look at Unarmed Combat. No skill at all means the character
doesn't really know what he's doing. He might think he does, but
he's just getting by on intuition. He's never really been in a fight
or even thought about it much. If he hits someone, he could seriously hurt his hand.
A character with an Unarmed Combat Rating of 1 has probably thought about unarmed fighting a little. Perhaps she's just
started taking karate classes, and has learned to make a proper fist
and throw a formal punch. The character's form isn't great-she
doesn't know where to strike an opponent and where not to, and
she certainly hasn't tried out any moves on a live, moving target.
A character with Unarmed Combat 2 has started to put it
together-blocking. moving forward and backward, gauging
range when hitting or getting beneath someone's center of gravity when wrestling. He's figured out that if you attack high and
then low, you might beat someone's reaction time and hit them
where they're not expecting it. At Unarmed Combat 3, the character has a good chance of hurting someone pretty badly. She's
starting to read her opponent's body movements, recognizing
patterns in fighting, and experimenting with new techniques.
However, her fighting style boils down to a few key moves.
A character with Unarmed Combat 4 has been training for
three or four years and has developed enough ability to knock an
opponent down and Moderately wound him. The character is
learning to fight well by most methods (weapons, feet, hands,
elbows, wrestling), though he has a favorite method on which he
relies heavily.
At Unarmed Combat 5 or 6, a character can usually survive
most battles. Such characters know a few tricks, can pull off some
advanced combat moves (fingertip strikes to the throat, chokes,
quick arm breaks and so on) and are generally people you don't
want to pick on. Such characters may be first- or second-degree
black belts, serious street-fighters, bodyguards or bouncers.
A character with Unarmed Combat 7 or 8 is serious bad
news. She's the sort of individual that the cops hire to instruct
their patrolmen in the Barrens. She can take a weapon away from
an experienced opponent or strike an opponent's vulnerable pressure points and shut down his nervous system. Achieving an
Unarmed Combat rating of 9 or higher usually requires fifteen to
twenty years of study, experimentation or intense specialization in
a single area of combat. Such characters might retire undefeated
from a fighting circuit, found their own martial arts style, beat up
physads just for fun and teach the Sioux Wildcats and Tir Ghosts a
thing or two.
Finally, keep in mind that no game supplement can possibly
list all the different types of expertise characters can conceivably
acquire. Think about what your character would know if he or she
were a real person. Nearly everybody has acquired at least three
specialized abilities or areas of expertise they may not think of as
potential game skills. You can use hobbies, passions and bits of
information learned through the years to flesh out your character.
Tara assigns Virgil skills and skill ratings based
on the background she's created for him. Like all
SEAL deckers, Virgil possesses considerable
decking and deck-construction expertise, so she
gives him Computer 6 and Computer (B/R) 6.
She decides that he doesn't concentrate or specialize in either Computer Skill, because he must
build his own deck, write his own programs and
serve as the resident computer expert for the
rest of his shadowrunning team. After considering his general knowledge in this area, Tara
gives Virgil Electronics 5 as well.
Virgil also has formal education in computer
science, so Tara gives him Computer Theory 3.
That leaves Tara with 20 remaining points for
Virgil's other skills. The decker's career with the
SEALs has provided him with experience in night
maneuvers, demolitions, exercising and a little
combat. so Tara gives Virgil Stealth 4.
Demolitions 4. Athletics 4, Unarmed Combat 4
and Firearms 4. She then shows her notes to her
gamemaster. David, who looks them over.

To reflect Virgil's special-operations experience. Tara gives him the following
Concentrations: Demolitions (Plastic-Explosives)
3/5 and Unarmed Combat (Cyber Implant
Weaponry) 3/5. She doesn't give him a
Specialization in Unarmed Combat because she
wants Virgil to retain a degree of versatility in
Unarmed Combat. She also gives Virgil Etiquette
(Matrix) 3/5 to make him a serious informationgatherer and a lot nicer to be around.
For athletic endeavors, Virgil will rely on his
Physical Attributes, which are adequate for most
situations. Tara purchases for Virgil the Language
Skill of Japanese at a Skill Rating of 2.
Consequently, he'll sound like a foreigner when
he speaks the language, but he'll know enough to
get by.
Tara doesn't have enough Skill Points left to
give Virgil the Car Skill, so she simply notes his
driving ability on the back of his character sheet.
Without a Driving Skill. however, Virgil must rely
on the autopilot when driving. Virgil also attended the Virginia Military Institute and majored in
computer science. so he knows some other handy
subjects, such as higher math, that his skills won't
reflect. These subjects include Morse code.
wilderness survival tricks, SCUBA diving techniques, and the ability to translate lots of military
acronyms. Virgil's also a snorkler and knows about
as much marine biology as Tara does.
Tara's Resources priority for Virgil gives her
400.000 nuyen to spend, which she uses to purchase Wired Reflexes 1. Enhanced Articulation
and a smartgun link. The Wired Reflexes enable
Virgil to move with a superhuman 2D6 + 7
Initiative, and the Enhanced Articulation
bioware adds 1D6 to his Physical Skills, so he
looks coordinated and smooth. The smartgun
link, of course, makes him a pretty good shot.
RESOURCES
The Resources Attribute provides two things: money to purchase cyberware, gear and extras: and Force Points for magic
spells and foci. Only magicians receive Force Points, but all characters receive the money.
As with Attributes and skills, let your character's background
suggest appropriate gear when allocating resources. Characters
should not be able to pull money and gear out of thin air-they
should only possess items they can plausibly pay for and obtain.
based on their backgrounds.
When assigning a priority to your character's Resources, keep in
mind the optional rules for availability (p. 90), reputation (p. 32, and
Shadowbeat for media-based characters), and otaku (Virtual
Realities 2.0). These rules can affect the way your character is played.
so you may want to review them before assigning Resources.

computer training, so the gamemaster allows

Tara figures Virgil could easily have obtained
his cybereyes, Level 3 datajack and Smartlink II
during his training as a SEAL decker. Given
Virgil's computer experience, it seems natural
that he would prefer to save money by designing his own cyberdeck. That decision explains
the 800-Mp computer. microtronics shop and
kit. programming shop, and the Hitachi RM-AX
optical chip encoder,
Virgil's five extra contacts include an old decker friend who now works for Lone Star, a fixer, a
deckmeister, a rigger and his former commanding officer. For Virgil's two free contacts, Tara
selects a yakuza soldier and a yakuza boss -- she
reasons that the yakuza boss originally lured
Virgil away from the SEALs.
Initially, Tara wanted to give Virgil a Panther
assault cannon. The gamemaster nixed that idea,
however. Even considering Virgil's military background, it seemed unlikely that a decker would
be able to obtain such a powerful weapon. The
gamemaster therefore Invoked the optional
Availability rule (p. 90), which applies because
the Panther's Availability is higher than 6. In
place of the Panther. Tara selected a silenced.
smart submachine gun and some other nifty
items, such as flash and smoke grenades for
house-to-house runs, metal restraints in case
Virgil needs to kidnap someone, sunglasses and
an armored tuxedo.
Tara completes her character by dividing his
remaining nuyen of 155 by 10 for a total of 15.
Rolling 3 dice to calculate Virgil's starting nuyen
yields a 3. 3 and 6, which equals 12,000 nuyen
(12 × 1.000¥). Tara adds the 15 nuyen left over
from character creation for a final starting nuyen
total of 12,015. Virgil now has 12 credsticks
worth 1,000 nuyen each and one worth 15
nuyen. It's time for Virgil to hit the shadows!
FINISHING TOUCHES
After completing the game statistics, you can put the finishing touches on your character by creating a biographical sketch.
Then the gamemaster can introduce the character into game play.
A biographical sketch combines all the bits of background
you've created for your character. Tell the gamemaster as much as
you can about the character. This is your chance to go crazy. It's
your character, so he or she can have whatever history you wantno rules, priorities or numbers to worry about. Once again, the
Twenty Questions on pages 47-48, SRII offer a good place to
start with this part of the creative process.
As soon as you are finished fleshing out your character, the
gamemaster can find a way to introduce the new runner into
game play. A story line that lets the character demonstrate his
strengths and weaknesses makes for an interesting, believable
introduction, especially if the story also provides opportunities for
the personalities of the other characters to shine through. The
story should also include situations that force the characters to
work together. For suggestions on ways to introduce new characters into an established group, see Integrating New Team
Members, p. 89.
Though Virgil left the SEALs for the potentially
lucrative career of a shadowrunner, Tara is not
satisfied with the simple motivation that "he's
money-grubbing slime." She decides that Virgil
grew up in the newly seceded CAS. His family
experienced all sorts of financial problems, so
when Virgil was offered a scholarship, he accepted immediately. Virgil worked hard to get on to
a SEAL team, and military life satisfied him for
several years. As time wore on, however, he
grew disenchanted with it. When a serious illness sent his father to the hospital, Virgil decided the time had come to leave the SEALs and
make some quick money. Shadowrunning
seemed the best way to do that.
When a yakuza operative contacted Virgil and
offered him a generous payment for military passcodes, Virgil realized opportunity had come his
way. That deal alone enabled Virgil to pay for his
father's medical bills, but Virgil realized he could
never go back to the SEALs. He resigned his Navy
commission a few weeks later and began offering
his services in the shadow market.
Virgil likes to work on a close-knit team where
everyone covers each other. He's content to follow orders given by other people (this works out
well because Tara is an inexperienced
Shadowrun player). Virgil doesn't have many
friends outside of his team and contacts, and he
cares little about higher causes. Virgil likes puns.
marine biology, action simsense and figuring out
how to assemble machines.
Virgil is about 1.68 meters tall and 73 kilos, with
brown hair and light brown eyes. His teeth aren't
quite straight because his dad couldn't afford
braces for him during his childhood. He carries a
scar on his left torso as a result of being bitten by a
dog as a child.
Tara explains Virgil's background to the other
players, who are running an ork gang member
(Teeth) and an elf razorpunk (Zero-One). Both of
these characters want to stick it to Humanis.
Realistically, Virgil probably wouldn't work with
these guys for very long, but the gamemaster suggests that Virgil's fixer-the same fixer contact that
the other players selected-heard they were good
muscle and wants the three to work together once
to see how they do. That rationale sounds good
enough to the players.

By the time the characters complete the run,
each of the characters has saved the others
hides and proved that he's good at what he
does. The characters develop respect for one
another, and when the next job comes through,
Virgil rings up Teeth and Zero-One.
CHARACTER CREATION OPTIONS
The following variations of the standard character-creation
system suggest alternate methods that change the focus of character creation in several ways. Most of these variations are
designed to produce fairly balanced characters, but clever players
will undoubtedly find ways to use them to create characters with
massive combat abilities and few or no weaknesses or flaws. If
such characters fit your style of play, by all means use them.
Otherwise, gamemasters should carefully inspect characters created with these rules to ensure that they do not upset the balance
of play in their games.
Raising and lowering priority costs is perhaps the simplest
way to vary the character-creation system. In general, however,
altering priorities in some way allows gamemasters to discourage
or encourage the creation of certain types of characters that will
suit his campaign without restricting the players' freedom to
choose.
Specifically for the sum-to-10 and point-based character
design systems, we recommend that all players create their
characters using the same creation system in order to maintain
game balance.
ALTERING RACE PRIORITIES
The More Metahumans option (p. 46, SR II) reduces the priority of metahuman characters from A to C, thus providing players with added incentive to create metahuman characters.
Gamemasters who wish to keep metahumans a bit more uncommon in their games can lower the priority of "ordinary" metahumans to B and reserve Priority A for more "exotic" racial types.
such as metahuman variants or shapeshifters (see pp. 36-44).
Alternatively, gamemasters can assign different priorities to different Shadowrun races. For example, a gamemaster can assign
Priority A to dwarf or elf characters, and Priority B to ork or troll
characters. If desired, gamemasters can even eliminate the character-race priority category. However, this variation may produce
an overabundance of metahuman characters, most of whom possess certain abilities superior to those of normal human characters.
Gamemasters who lower the priority for metahuman characters may choose to compensate for metahumans' natural advantages by emphasizing the prejudice against and unique obstacles
faced by metahumans in the Sixth World. The gamemaster can
achieve this by using such optional rules as the Racism and
Charisma rules (p. 182, SRII) or the Prejudice rules on pp.
137-40 in the California Free State sourcebook. While metahumans may be harassed by groups such as the Humanis Policlub,
Alamos 20,000 and the Human Nation, gamemasters can also
give human characters trouble from human-hating metahuman
groups such as the Sons of Sauron.
ALTERING MAGIC PRIORITIES
Gamemasters can encourage the proliferation of magicians
and adepts in their games by lowering the priority cost for creating these characters. Generally, any priority change should affect
all magician and adept character types equally. In some circumstances, gamemasters may wish to encourage or discourage specific magical character types. For example, a gamemaster running
a tribal campaign may wish to encourage his players to design
shaman characters by lowering the priority for shaman characters
to B, keeping the priority of mage characters at A and adjusting
the priority cost for adepts accordingly. This variation provides
shaman characters with an advantage over mage characters.
Lowering the priority cost for creating magically active characters can lead to the creation of very powerful magicians blessed
with Priority A Resources. Gamemasters should carefully consider
the effects of lowering priorities for magical characters before
doing so. and determine how to balance his game against such
characters. In fact, gamemasters should reserve most magicalcharacter priority reductions for campaigns tailored to magic and
magician characters.
ALTERING ATTRIBUTE AND SKILL PRIORITIES
Altering the cost of other priority categories often provides
players with greater options when assigning their characters'
Attributes and Skills.
If desired, gamemasters can also raise or lower the startingpoint limits for these categories to foster the creation of stronger
or weaker characters. However, gamemasters can achieve these
same effects more simply by giving characters initial Karma
bonuses to increase their skills and abilities before the game
begins, or by raising or lowering the initial Attribute and Skill rating limits (see Altering Rating Limits, p. 20).
ALTERING RESOURCE PRIORITIES
Gamemasters can change the amount of resources offered at
any given priority to give characters greater or fewer resources at
the start of the game. Alternatively, gamemasters can set a standard amount of resources that all characters receive. This variation
allows the gamemaster to know in advance how many nuyen all
player characters will have to spend and to better judge what
equipment they will be able to purchase.
Gamemasters can also set specific equipment restrictions by
creating lists of approved equipment for starting characters. For
example, a gamemaster may allow starting characters to use any
cyberware listed in SRII but restrict some of the cybertech and
bioware items in the Shadowtech or Cybertechnology sourcebooks, Or gamemasters can set general restrictions, such as "no
bioware for starting characters." Alternatively, gamemasters can
set limits using the Availability ratings of equipment. For example,
a gamemaster may declare that starting characters may only possess equipment of Availability 6 or lower. (In fact, Availability 6
seems to be a workable equipment limit for most Shadowrun
campaigns.) Gamemasters may also set the equipment
Availability limit for their games at the same level as the initial
Attribute and Skill rating limits. See Availability rules, p. 90.

ALTERING RATING LIMITS
Gamemasters can also shape the design of new characters by
altering the rating limits on starting Attributes and Skills.
Lowering the rating limits from the standard upper limit of 6
tends to result in characters who have many different skills and
abilities but are masters of none. For example, a rating limit of 4
produces characters whose Skill ratings make them competent in
a few areas but who are no match for the more experienced and
capable character archetypes from SRII. However, such characters usually have the advantage of a greater variety of skills than
the archetypes. This variation works well for campaigns in which
the characters play gang members, corporate types forced into
the shadows, newshounds or newbie runners looking to make a
name for themselves-pretty much anything except experienced
shadowrunners,
Increasing the Skill and Attribute rating limits without
increasing the total available character-creation points enables
players to create characters with extreme abilities and weaknesses. Under a rating limit of 8, for example, the system tends to produce ultra-specialized characters such as a fantastic marksman or
computer hacker who can't tie his own shoes without help. Such
characters may be ill-suited for general play, but players and
gamemasters may find them ideal for special campaigns or a simple change of pace.
SUM-TO-10 SYSTEM
In the sum-to-10 system, each priority is replaced with a
numerical value between 4 and 0: A = 4, B = 3. C = 2, D = 1, and
E = 0. (Long-time Shadowrun players may recognize this variation from the Shadowrun, First Edition rulebook.) Players set their
character priority levels however they desire, as long as the final
combined priority levels do not exceed 10. For example, a character may have priority combinations of 4, 3, 2. 1, 0; or 4, 4, 1, 1,
0: or 3. 3. 3. 1, 0; or any other combination that adds up to 10.
Like most of the other variations described here, the sum-to-10
system can be abused, so the gamemaster should keep an eye on
the choices his players are making. This system provides the greatest opportunity for the creation of virtually invincible characters.
POINT-BASED DESIGN
The point-based system provides players with great flexibility when designing characters.
This system rests on a simple premise. In place of the standard priorities-A, B, C. D and E-the gamemaster declares a
Building Points allotment. Each player then uses his Building
Points to purchase his or her character's Race, Magic, Attributes,
Skills and Resources. We recommend a Building Point allocation
of 100.
Magically capable characters created using the point-based
system automatically receive 30 Force Points, rather than a number of Force Points based on the priority assigned to Resources
(see also Magic, p. 21). While this results in characters that are
always less powerful at creation than identical characters created
using the priorities system, magical characters designed using the
point-based system are more appropriately balanced with other
character types in the game. In other words, they still kick butt,

but not at the expense of game balance. Also, because players are
not forced to accept a certain number of Force Points in order to
get a specific level of Resources or vice versa, they can more successfully tailor their characters to the background, team function
and personality they desire.
Using this system, gamemasters still can restrict their players
choices or encourage the creation of certain character types by
setting rating limits on characters' Attributes and Skills. By adjusting the starting Building Point amount, gamemasters can control
the general power of characters. The point-based system also provides a convenient way to "handicap" players. For example, a
gamemaster can make play more challenging for experienced
players by reducing their starting Building Points and increasing
the Building Points of inexperienced or new players.
The Building Points Table suggests Building Point costs for
various character components. For the costs of Edges and Flaws,
see Edges and Flaws, page 21.
Race
If desired, gamemasters can vary the Building Point costs for
characters of different metahuman races or add even more expensive races (see Altering Race Priorities, p. 19).

Magic
Decreasing the Building Point cost of magical ability will
encourage the creation of magically active characters, and
increasing the Building Point cost will discourage players from
designing such characters.
Magicians and all non-physical adepts automatically receive
30 Force Points at character creation. At the gamemaster's discretion, players may gain additional Force Points at character creation by "buying" them at a cost of | Building Point for each 2
Force Points. Players may reduce the number of Force Points available at character creation in favor of gaining additional Building
Points by "selling" them at a ratio of 2 Force Points for every 1
Building Point.
Note that physical adept characters do not begin the game
with 30 Force Points: these are not available to trade for Building
Points. Physical adepts still only receive a number of points equal
to their characters's Magic Rating for buying powers (see p. 125,
SRII).
Skills
Skills cost | Building Point per level up to the point cap determined by the gamemaster. Because players choose their characters' Concentrations and Specializations after they purchase their
skills, these have no additional cost.
Spells
In addition to the standard uses for Force Points during character creation, gamemasters may allow player characters to use
Force Points in place of Karma Points in order to begin the game
as an initiate, to summon and maintain an ally spirit and so on.
If we assign Building Point costs to the numbers chosen to create Virgil (the SEAL decker
from the examples in the previous section) using
the standard character creation system, we end
up with a total of 102 Building Points. This number is only 2 points above the standard recommended above, which demonstrates that the
two character creation systems can be balanced.
If the gamemaster prefers to adhere strictly to
the 100-point cap, he might require Tara (the
player who created Virgil) to give her character a
2-point Flaw (see Edges and Flaws) to reduce
the Building Points to 100. Gamemasters may
also choose to allow a range of Building Points to
accommodate such minor overages.

EDGES AND FLAWS
Edges and Flaws help players create more fully realized starting characters and give the gamemaster a few good hooks with
which to bring new characters into his campaign. Edges and Flaws
enable players to modify and flesh out their characters by providing them with specific advantages (Edges) and disadvantages
(Flaws). Unlike the character-creation variations described earlier
in this section, Edges and Flaws do not represent an "across-theboard" system of altering player characters; each individual player selects specific Edges and Flaws for his or her character, or may
decline to use this option at all. This allows Edges and Flaws to be
used with any of the variant character-creation systems or with the
standard system provided in the Shadowrun rulebook.
As with any optional rule, gamemasters have the final say
over which Edges and Flaws may be used in their campaigns, and
may prohibit the use of this option altogether.
PURCHASING EDGES AND FLAWS
Players purchase Edges and Flaws during character creation.
(If desired, gamemasters may allow their players to add Edges
and Flaws to their characters at any time during game play.
Because many Edges and Flaws actually represent things that
might happen to characters over the course of their lives, however. we recommend that gamemasters require such advantages
and disadvantages to be incorporated into existing characters
through roleplaying.)
Every Edge and Flaw has a point value-Edges have positive
("plus") values and Flaws have negative ("minus") values. When
using the standard letter-based priority system, players may select

any combinations of Edges and Flaws whose combined point values equal zero. For example, a player might select Ambidexterity
(2 points), Color Blind (-1 point), and Combat Monster (-1 point)
for his character.
Players can purchase Edges and Flaws in the same manner
using the point-based character-creation system, or gamemasters
may allow their players to use Building Points when selecting
Edges and Flaws. In this case, a player can spend Building Points
to buy Edges or increase the number of Building Points he has
available by the point value of any Flaws he takes. For example, a
player who takes the Flaw of Blind (-6 points) can add 6 Building
Points to his allowance.
In the following Edge and Flaw descriptions, a positive value
indicates an Edge and a negative value Indicates a Flaw. The point
values of all Edges and Flaws described in this section also appear
in the Edges/Flaws Table on page 35.
LIMITATIONS
In all cases, bonuses from Edges cannot raise Attribute, skill
or Spell Force ratings beyond the standard rating limits and maximums for new characters except with the gamemaster's
approval. In cases where Edges and Flaws modify test target numbers, target numbers can never be reduced below 2.
Unless otherwise noted. Edges and Flaws cannot be combined. For example, a player cannot gain the advantages at character creation that would be allowed by taking both the Pacifist
and Total Pacifist Flaws for his or her character.
The High School Education Edge implies that unless a character has this Edge, he or she may be considered to have only an
eighth-grade level of academic achievement. Depending on the
type of campaign the gamemaster runs and the desired backgrounds of his players' characters, an assumed lack of formal education might not fit the group's gaming style. The gamemaster
can handle this several ways, the easiest of which is simply to not
allow education-based Edges and Flaws to be used in the game
(Illiterate, Uneducated, High School Education, Technical School
Education, College Education). A lack of formal education does
not mean that a character is stupid or illiterate, only that he or she
does not hold a graduation certificate or other degree. A character may be self-taught: he may have completed all the necessary
coursework for a certificate or degree but still owe the educational institution money, allowing them to withhold the graduation
paperwork: she may have been tutored at home and lack a certificate from a recognized institution or may have finished her
high-school equivalency degree studies but not taken the final exam.
ELIMINATING FLAWS
With enough effort, individuals can overcome nearly any bad
habit or learn to minimize the effects of innate physical or psychological disorders. To reflect this, gamemasters may give their
players the option of eliminating their characters" Flaws during the
course of game play. If you use this option, make the characters
work hard to overcome a Flaw. Just like in real life, eliminating a
Flaw should be a difficult and long-term process. For example, in
order to eliminate an addiction, the character must endure a
painful withdrawal process.
Many Flaws can be eliminated or otherwise resolved with sufficiently Involved campign setups and convincing, in-character
roleplaying. In addition to any requirements the gamemaster sets
for permanently getting rid of a Flaw, the character must pay
Good Karma equal to 10 x the Flaw's point value. A character trying to kick BTL addiction, for example, must go through the withdrawal process and then pay 30 points of Good Karma (10 x 3point Flaw) to get the monkey off his back for good.
Some Flaws also require medical attention or other radical
procedures to eliminate. The gamemaster determines the nuyen
cost of these measures, which must be paid by the character in
addition to the Karma cost. Players should keep in mind, however, that eliminating one Flaw might just gain the character another: paying Karma and cash for surgery to remove the Night
Blindness Flaw might result in an unexpected cortex bomb.
DESIGNING EDGES AND FLAWS
Custom-designed Edges and Flaws provide gamemasters
and players with even greater opportunities to give characters distinct traits. Use the Edges and Flaws described in this section as
models when designing your own. In general, no Edge should be
worth more than 6 points and no Flaw should be worth more than
-6 points. Base the point value of new Edges and Flaws on each
one's benefits or drawbacks. For example, an Edge that provides
a character with substantial benefits should have a high point
value; an Edge that provides only minimal benefits should have a
low point value. Finally, all Edges and Flaws must be approved by
the gamemaster before players may use them in a game.
Stacy wants to create a character who's a
drop-dead gorgeous head-turner-a character
who gets noticed right away and uses her looks
to get her way. The gamemaster. Bryan, likes the
idea and suggests a new Edge to reflect the character's use of her stunning looks.
He calls the new Edge "Good Looking and
Knows It." He decides that the Edge provides a
-2 target modifier on all Social and Etiquette
Tests made when dealing with members of the
opposite sex (-1 target modifier when dealing
with members of the same sex). Furthermore.
members of the opposite sex greet the character
with Friendly attitudes when they first meet her
(see the Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRII). Bryan
decides that these benefits are worth 2 points.
Stacy feels that the benefits are not worth the
2 points the Edge will cost. She says that the
Edge provides a benefit only during initial contacts between her character and others. Her
argument convinces Bryan, who reduces Good
Looking and Knows It to a I-point Edge.
Bryan then decides that the flip side of good
looks-bad looks-could make an interesting
Flaw. He christens the new I-point Flaw "Ugly
and Doesn't Care." The effects of Ugly and
Doesn't Care are simply the reverse of Good

Looking's benefits. A character with the Flaw
receives a +2 target modifier on all Social and
Etiquette Tests when dealing with members of
the opposite sex (+1 target modifier when dealing with members of the same sex). New
acquaintances display Suspicious attitudes when
first meeting the character (see the Social Skill
Table, p. 182, SRII).
ATTRIBUTE EDGES
Bonus Attribute Point
Value: 1
A player can gain 1 bonus Attribute Point for his or her character. The bonus Attribute Point can be added to any Attribute
except Essence, Reaction or Magic.
Players can take no more than 5 bonus Attribute Points.
Unless authorized by the gamemaster, bonus Attribute Points
cannot raise the Attribute Ratings of characters beyond the racial
maximums for the character. (See Exceptional Attribute.)
Exceptional Attribute
Value: 2
A player can increase the racial maximum for one of his or her
character's Attributes by 1.
Note that Exceptional Attribute simply raises the maximumit does not increase the character's actual Attribute Rating to the
new maximum. To do that, players must take bonus Attribute
Points per the Bonus Attribute Point Edge. Further, the bonus
Attribute Point used to raise the character's rating beyond the
original racial maximum has an Edge value of 2. At the gamemaster's discretion, the player character may increase the maximum
rating by spending Karma at any time during the game.
Player characters can take Exceptional Attribute only once per
Attribute.
SKILL EDGES AND FLAWS
Aptitude/Incompetence
Value: 2/-2
Aptitude or Incompetence reflect expertise or ineptitude in a
particular skill.
A character with Aptitude for a skill gains a -1 target modifier to all tests made with the skill. A character with Incompetence
receives a +1 target modifier to all tests made with the skill.
Characters can have Aptitude or Incompetence only in skills
that they can use. The character must know the skill or be able to
default to it through the Skill Web.
Characters may take Aptitude or Incompetence only once for
any single skill. Gamemasters may also wish to limit characters to
1 Aptitude, but should allow player characters to be incompetent
in as many areas as the player wants. Closely monitor the use of
Aptitude-enhanced Combat, Magical and Computer skills, as
these can easily disrupt the balance of a game. In fact, gamemasters may choose to prohibit players from using the Aptitude Edge
with certain skills to prevent such problems.
If possible, gamemasters should try to highlight characters'
areas of Aptitude and Incompetence at least once per game.
Bonus Skill Point
Value: 1
For I point, the character gains I bonus Skill Point, which he
can add to any skill. Players may purchase no more than 5 bonus
Skill Points for their characters.
Bonus Skill Points cannot be used to raise skill ratings above
the limits for starting characters.
Home Ground
Value: 2
Home Ground provides a character with a -1 target modifier
for all Skill Tests made within the character's home turf.
The character's home turf is a particular location with which
the character is intimately familiar. The location must be either a
small area-no larger than a single building-or an environment
that is encountered infrequently during the campaign. For example, in a Seattle-based campaign, the desert would be an infrequently encountered environment and could be considered home
ground for a displaced desert nomad character. The desert would
not be a suitable home ground in a campaign based in the magicsoaked Mojave, however. Gamemasters must approve all home
grounds in their campaigns.
For a decker character, a home ground might be a particular
computer system-a Matrix Host the decker knows extremely
well, for example. In this case, the character would receive the +1
target modifier for all tests made while in that system. Favorite
data havens, particularly the Denver Nexus, also make suitable
home grounds for decker characters. Many corporate deckers
have the Home Ground Edge in their corporate systems.
All home grounds must be fixed locations-characters cannot
move them around. If a character's home ground is destroyed,
the character loses his Home Ground Edge.
PHYSICAL EDGES AND FLAWS
Physical Edges and Flaws stem from a character's physical
body and capabilities. Assume that the physical Flaws presented
below cannot be corrected with cybertechnology or existing medical technology.
Adrenaline Surge
Value: 2
Adrenaline Surge enables a character to react more quickly
than normal during combat situations. A player character with this
Edge may use it any time in combat.
When employing Adrenaline Surge, the character uses the
Rule of Six for Initiative (p. 32, SRII) but receives a +1 target modifier on Combat Tests and Perception Tests made in combat situations. Once a character uses Adrenaline Surge, he must use it for
the remainder of the combat or until the danger has passed.
Characters whose Reaction or Initiative is already enhanced
by cyberware, bioware or magic (including shapeshifters and
physical adepts) may not purchase Adrenaline Surge.
Allergy
Value: - 1 to -4
A character with the Allergy Flaw is allergic to a substance or
condition. To calculate the value of an Allergy, decide whether the

ALLERGY TABLE

-1 point
Symptoms are discomforting and distracting.
Apply a +1 target modifier to all tests made

weapons made from this
substance when they are
used against a character
with a Moderate Allergy.

minute he touches or
remains exposed to the
substance. Add 2 to the
Power of weapons made

they are used against a
character with a Severe
Allergy.
substance or condition is Uncommon or Common, then determine the severity of the symptoms-Mild, Moderate, or Severe.
Consult the Allergy Table and add together the appropriate point
values. For example, the value of an Uncommon Moderate
Allergy is -3 points.
Ambidexterity
Value: 2
Ambidexterity enables a character to use either hand equally
well. The character applies no target modifiers for using his or her
"off" hand. However, the +2 target modifier for using two
weapons at once still applies.
The Ambidexterity Edge may be used to replace the Special
Skill: Ambidexterity provided on page 81. Fields of Fire.
Bio-Rejection
Value: - 5 (-2 for magically active characters)
The immune system of a character with Bio-Rejection is especially sensitive to foreign tissue and material, and the bodies of
such characters reject all cyberware and bioware implants. Any
organ or limb replacements must be cloned from the character's
own cells.
For magically active characters (magicians and adepts), BioRejection costs only -2 points. Shaman characters whose totems
carry cyberware Essence penalties (such as Eagle or Unicorn) cannot take the Flaw of Bio-Rejection. Characters cannot take both
Bio-Rejection and Sensitive System.
Blind
Value: - 6 (-2 for magically active characters)
A character with the Blind Flaw receives a +6 target modifier
for all visual-based tests. Cyber-replacement eyes cannot correct
the Blind Flaw.
Magically active characters with the Blind Flaw may still use
astral perception as a form of sight. Such characters receive a +2
target modifier for visual tests based solely in the physical world.
However. the Blind Flaw costs only -2 points for such characters.
Characters with the Blind Flaw cannot take Color Blind or Night
Blindness.
Borrowed Time
Value: - 6
A character with the Borrowed Time Flaw may die at any
time. The character might have a fatal illness, be infected with a
slow-acting poison or have a deadly implant such as a cortex
bomb. In any case, the character's life span can be measured in
months.
Whenever a character takes the Borrowed Time Flaw, the
gamemaster secretly rolls 3D6. The result indicates the number of
game months before the character dies. When the character's
time is up, he dies-nothing can save him. Give the character a
dramatic death scene.
If the player changes his mind and wants his character to survive, the gamemaster may allow the player to exchange
Borrowed Time for another Flaw(s) worth -6 points. This option
should not be made available when the player chooses the Flaw.
however, because knowing that Borrowed Time need not be fatal
effectively negates any drama created by the character's knowledge of his Impending death. The gamemaster can make his decision if and when the player makes the request.
Color Blind
Value: - 1
A character with the Color Blind Flaw sees the world in black.
white and shades of gray. The character receives a +4 target modifier for any tests in which distinguishing between colors is important, such as sifting through the tangle of colored wires in a bomb
to find the one that will disarm it.
Note that Color Blind results from a neural dysfunction and
cannot be cured with cyber-replacement eyes. Characters cannot
take both Blind and Color Blind.

Deaf
Value: - 3
A character with the Deaf Flaw cannot hear. The character
cannot make Hearing Tests, and receives a +4 target modifier for
any tests in which hearing is a factor (such as Surprise Tests).
The Hearing Flaw cannot be cured with cyberware.
Double Jointed
Value: 1
A Double Jointed character has unusually flexible joints and
can bend and contort his or her body into extreme positions. The
character receives a -1 target modifier for Acrobatic and Escape
Artist Tests. At the gamemaster's discretion, the character can
squeeze into small, cramped spaces through which less limber
characters cannot pass.
High Pain Tolerance
Value: Variable
High Pain Tolerance enables a character to resist the effects of
damage to a limited degree. The number of points the character
spends on the High Pain Tolerance Edge determines how many
boxes of physical or mental damage the character can resist.
In all other respects, High Pain Tolerance uses the same rules
as the adept power Pain Resistance (see p. 126, SRII).
Infirm
Value: - 1 to -5
The Infirm Flaw represents a character's deteriorating physical fitness, Infirm characters need not be old or ill-they may simply be individuals who neglect their physical well-being, such as
"couch potato" deckers or magicians.
The Infirm Flaw may range from -1 to -5 points. For every
Infirm point, reduce the racial maximum of the character's
Physical Attributes by I.
Lightning Reflexes
Value: 2, 4 or 6
For every 2 points spent on Lightning Reflexes, a character
receives a +1 bonus to his Reaction Rating. Players cannot purchase
more than 6 points of Lightning Reflexes (+3 Reaction bonus).
Bonuses from Lightning Reflexes do not affect Initiative dice.
but they are cumulative with any Reaction bonuses from cyberware, biotech or magic.
Gamemasters should carefully monitor the use of Lightning
Reflexes In their games to prevent the creation of characters with
superhuman Reaction Ratings.
Low Pain Tolerance
Value: - 4
Characters with Low Pain Tolerance are particularly sensitive
to pain. When calculating Wound-related target modifiers for such
characters, increase their Wounds by | level.

Natural Immunity
Value: 1
Characters with Natural Immunity have an innate or developed immunity to a single natural disease or toxin. The disease or
toxin in question cannot affect the character. However, Natural
Immunity provides no protection against man-made toxins and
biowarfare agents.
Night Blindness
Value: - 2
Night Blindness makes a character effectively blind at night or
in darkness. In Full Darkness or Minimal Light conditions (see p.
89. SRII), the character receives an additional +6 target modifier
for visual-based tests. Characters cannot take both Blind and Night
Blindness.
Night Vision
Value: 1
Night Vision provides human characters with improved night
vision. Such characters can see normally in light levels as low as
starlight. However, total darkness (rare in twenty-first-century
cities) still renders the user as blind as an individual with normal
vision.
Paraplegic
Value: - 3
Paraplegic characters are paralyzed from the waist down.
Such characters can perform physical tasks that do not require the
use of their legs and can move around via wheelchair, but the
Paraplegic Flaw reduces their Combat Pools by half (round down).
Characters with the Paraplegic Flaw can and often do become
highly effective deckers, magicians and riggers.
The Paraplegic Flaw cannot be treated with cyberware.
Characters cannot take both Paraplegic and Quadriplegic.
Quadriplegic
Value: - 6
Quadriplegic characters are paralyzed from the neck down
and cannot perform physical tasks of any kind. The Quadriplegic
Flaw does not affect a character's Attributes or use of Mental
Skills. Use the character's Physical Attributes for calculating abilities such as Reaction per standard rules. If desired, a character
with the Quadriplegic Flaw may take the Infirm Flaw as well.
Characters with the Quadriplegic Flaw require permanent
Hospitalized Lifestyles and the attention of hired medical attendants or programmed robot drones to perform physical tasks for
them. The Quadriplegic Flaw cannot be treated or cured with
cybertechnology or magic. Characters cannot take both
Quadriplegic and Paraplegic.
The Quadriplegic Flaw has no effect on a character's abilities
within the Matrix or in astral space.
Quick Healer
Value: 2
A character with the Quick Healer Edge recovers from damage more quickly than other characters. Reduce the target numbers for the character's Healing Tests by 2 after applying all other
modifiers. The target number cannot be reduced to less than 2.
Resistance to Pathogens
Value: 1
A character with Resistance to Pathogens has a vigorous
immune system that fights off diseases and infections. The character gains | additional Body die when resisting the effects of disease.
Resistance to Toxins
Value: 1
A character with Resistance to Toxins can fight off toxins and
drugs more easily than other characters. The character gains 1 additional Body die when resisting the effects of drugs and toxins.
Sensitive System
Value: - 3 (-2 for magically active characters)
A character with the Sensitive System Flaw has immuno-suppressive problems with implants. However, these effects are less
severe than those of the Bio-Rejection Flaw. The character must
double all Essence losses caused by cyberware implants, and
incurs twice the normal Body Index for bioware. Cultured bioware
and replacement parts cloned from the character's own cells are
not affected by this Flaw.
If a character with this Flaw is magically active, Sensitive
System costs only -2 points. The penalties are the same as for a
non-magical character, and the player must also deduct any
Essence loss due to this Flaw from the character's Magic Rating.
Characters cannot take both Bio-Rejection and Sensitive System.
Toughness
Value: 2
Characters with the Toughness Edge shrug off damage more
easily than others. Such characters gain I additional Body die for
Damage Resistance Tests only. (This bonus die is cumulative with
natural dermal armor, so a troll with Toughness is really tough.)
Weak Immune System
Value: - 1
A character with the Weak Immune System Flaw is more susceptible to infection by disease than his or her Body Attribute suggests. Reduce the character's Body dice by 1 during tests made to
resist diseases (the Body dice cannot drop below 1 on Resistance
Tests). Weak Immune System is triggered by the immuno-suppression treatments used in cybernetic and bio-genetic procedures-consequently, it most often afflicts characters who have
undergone considerable cyberware or bioware modifications.
Will to Live
Value: 1 to 3
For each point spent on Will to Live, a character gains 1 additional Damage Overflow Box. These additional boxes only allow
the character to take additional damage before dying. They do not
raise the threshold at which the character becomes unconscious or
Incapacitated, nor do they affect target modifiers based on the
character's Injuries.

MENTAL EDGES AND FLAWS
Amnesia
Value: - 2 to -5
A character with Amnesia has lost some or all of his memory. (Such memory loss can be caused by neurological damage,
magic, drugs or brainwashing.) The severity of the character's
Amnesia is determined by the selected point value of the Flaw
(between -2 and -5). A character with -2 Amnesia cannot recall
who he is or anything about his past, but he retains the use of his
skills and abilities. A character with -5 Amnesia has no memory of
his past, including the skills and abilities he has learned.
Gamemasters should create character sheets for characters with
-5-point Amnesia, so that the player character does not know his
character's abilities, Attributes, and so on until he acts.
Bravery
Value: 1
Characters with the Bravery Edge are not as easily frightened
as most people. The character receives a -I target modifier on
tests made to resist fear and intimidation, including Fear caused
by spells and critter powers.
College Education
Value: 2
A character with the College Education Edge has attended
college and knows a substantial amount about a diverse group of
subjects (choose a major, if you like). Reduce by half the Skill Web
penalty when the character uses any Knowledge Skill. This Edge
cannot be combined with any other Education Edges.
Combat Monster
Value: - 1
A character with the Combat Monster Flaw becomes irrationally vicious in combat situations. It takes the character at least
3 Combat Rounds to break away from a fight. The character can
make a Willpower (6) Test to shorten this time-each success
reduces the period by 1 round, to a minimum of 1 round.
Otherwise, the character can break away from a fight sooner only
if he kills or disables all his opponents. Characters cannot take
both Combat Monster and Combat Paralysis.
Combat Paralysis
Value: - 4
A character with Combat Paralysis tends to "freeze up" in
combat situations. On the character's first Initiative roll during any
combat, assume the result is the minimum the character can roll
with his Initiative dice. This applies to all forms of combat-physical, astral or cybercombat. The character also receives a +2 target
modifier on Surprise Tests. Characters cannot take both Combat
Paralysis and Combat Monster.
Common Sense
Value: 2
A character with Common Sense has an unusually sharp
sense of practicality. Any time such a character is about to do
something the gamemaster deems foolish, the gamemaster must
warn the player. A remark such as, "You might want to reconsider that," would be appropriate.
Compulsive
Value: Variable
Compulsive characters possess some compulsive behavior
over which they have little or no control. The value of this Flaw
depends on how dangerous and troublesome the behavior is for
the character. For example, a character who is compulsively organized isn't going to suffer much more than the occasional annoyance of his teammates: his Compulsive Flaw will be worth no
more than -1 point. By contrast, a decker who compulsively
breaks into high-level corporate Host systems would receive -3
points for his Flaw.
Flashbacks
Value: - 4
The Flashbacks Flaw causes a character to experience vivid memory-based sensory hallucinations, known as flashbacks. These flashbacks are always triggered by specific stimuli. For example, a character who was tortured by the Universal Brotherhood might experience
flashbacks of the torture whenever he or she sees an insect.
Any time a character with Flashbacks encounters a potential
flashback trigger, he or she must make a Willpower (6) Test. If the
test fails, a flashback occurs and incapacitates the character for
ID6 minutes. The character cannot take any useful action during
that time.
Characters with the Flashback Flaw should confer with their
gamemasters to devise an appropriate flashback trigger before
beginning play. The trigger condition can be a particular sight.
smell, sound, taste, idea and so on. The condition should be
something that the character will encounter a few times during a
game. If the trigger is too common, the character may end up
experiencing flashbacks all the time. If it is too rare, the character
may never experience any.
High School Education
Value: 1
A character with High School Education attended high school
and actually paid enough attention to remember a few basic
things, such as the table of the chemical elements, long division,
and some pre-Awakening history.
A character with High School Education can subtract | circle
on the Skill Web when defaulting to an Attribute for Knowledge
Skills. Through roleplaying, this Edge can be replaced by Technical
School Education or College Education.
Impulsive
Value: - 2
An Impulsive character tends to jump into dangerous situations without thinking about the possible consequences. When
confronted with a dangerous situation, the character must make a
successful Willpower (4) Test to avoid blindly jumping into the
thick of things.

Moderate
-2 points
The character's reaction is seriously distracting. Apply a +2 target modifier to all tests made
while the character experiences the reaction. Additionally, the character tries to avoid the
triggering condition. Directly confronting the condition requires a successful Willpower (4)
Test.
Severe
-3 points
The character collapses in terror or runs away any time he encounters the triggering condition.
unless he makes a successful Willpower (6) Test. If the test succeeds, the character may act
while experiencing the reaction, but he receives a +2 target modifier to all tests.
Illiterate
Value: - 1
An Illiterate character cannot read (any character who grew
up on the streets or in an Isolated rural area may never have
learned). Such characters cannot take most Technical or
Knowledge skills and must rely on other characters to translate
written information for them. Illiterate characters can use computer programs that rely on icons rather than written commands and
instructions: however, such characters receive a +4 target modifier to all computer-related tests and cannot have a Computer Skill
higher than 1.
Characters may not take both the Illiterate Flaw and any
Education Edge. Through roleplaying, a character can replace the
Illiterate Flaw with the Uneducated Flaw (p. 30).
Oblivious
Value: - 2
An Oblivious character often fails to notice things (this Flaw
may result from a short attention span or some other perceptual
problem). Such characters receive a +1 target modifier on all
Perception Tests, including Astral Perception Tests. The Flaw does
not affect combat modifiers for vision or range.
Pacifist
Value: - 2
A Pacifist character is unusually principled for the Sixth World.
He cannot take the life of another person except in self-defense,
and even then he kills as humanely as possible. Such characters
cannot participate in premeditated murders or assassinations and
are compelled to dissuade their fellow shadowrunners from killing
unnecessarily. Some individuals respect the restraint of Pacifist
shadowrunners, while others consider them useless wimps.
Characters cannot take both Pacifist and Total Pacifist.
Perceptive
Value: 2
Perceptive characters are likely to notice small details and
clues that others may miss. Characters with this Edge receive a -1
target modifier on all Perception Tests, including Astral Perception
Tests. However, the Perceptive Edge has no effect on detection
spells or the use of sensors via a neural interface. The Perceptive
Edge does not affect vision modifiers in combat.
Perfect Time
Value: 1
A character with Perfect Time has a split-second sense of timing that enables him or her to always know the current time, to
the minute. Prolonged periods of isolation, unconsciousness or
the application of mind-benders such as drugs or chips can throw
off the character's sense of time, but the character quickly recovers his or her Perfect Time when such conditions are removed.
Phobia
Value: - 1 to -3
A character with a Phobia suffers from deep-seated fear activated by a specific triggering condition. To calculate the value of
a Phobia, determine whether the triggering condition is
Uncommon or Common, then determine the severity of the character's reaction-Mild. Moderate or Severe. Consult the Phobia
Table and add together the appropriate point values. For example.
the value of an Uncommon Moderate Phobia is -3 points.
Note that Common Severe Phobias (a grave fear of going outside, for example) can seriously impede a character's actions.
Photographic Memory
Value: 3
A character with the Photographic Memory Edge never forgets
anything he or she has experienced. The character can perfectly

addictive substance.
Incapacitating
-3 points The character is totally helpless while under the influence of the addictive substance.
The character cannot perform any real action apart from sitting and staring into space.
recall faces, dates, numbers or anything else he or she has seen or
heard. If the player forgets something that his or her character
knows, the gamemaster must provide the correct information.
Photographic Memory is especially useful for decker characters, because it enables them to remember complex security
codes and other, equally useful Information without having to
write it down.
Sense of Direction
Value: 1
A character with the Sense of Direction Edge never gets lost. The
character always knows where true north lies, and can always retrace
his or her path. However, Sense of Direction doesn't help a character
orient himself if he has been transported somewhere while unconscious or if he is unable to see or otherwise sense his surroundings.
Technical School Education
Value: 1
A character with the Technical School Education Edge can
push buttons and pull switches with the best of them. Reduce
penalties by half when the character uses the Skill Web for
Technical or Build and Repair Tests. Through roleplaying, this Edge
can be replaced by College Education.
Total Pacifist
Value: - 5
A character with the Total Pacifist Flaw cannot kill any living
creature that possesses more intelligence than an insect (this
includes insect spirits, which are reasonably intelligent), regardless of the provocation. If the character does so, he suffers from
intense regret and depression for 2D6 weeks. During this time.
the character refuses to do anything other than eat, sleep and go
about his daily routine.
Understandably, the Total Pacifist Flaw is rare among shadowrunners. However, a few shamans of the more pacifistic and
healing-oriented totems, such as Snake, exhibit this tendency.
Characters cannot take both Total Pacifist and Pacifist.
Uneducated
Value: - 1
An Uneducated character possesses only a rudimentary
knowledge of reading, writing and arithmetic. The character cannot take any Knowledge or Technical Skills during character creation, and suffers an additional +1 for each dot counted when
using the Skill Web.
Through roleplaying, this Flaw can be replaced by the High
School and Technical School Education Edges.
Vindictive
Value: - 2
Vindictive characters are especially vengeful and go out of their
way to correct any slight against them, no matter how small. The retribution varies according to the slight. A simple Insult might call for
a coldly delivered threat or punch in the face, while an injury almost
always calls for the death or maiming of the offending individual.
Vindictive characters carry grudges until they avenge the perceived wrong they have suffered. They can be loyal and capable
comrades, but cross them once and you are on their hit lists forever.
SOCIAL EDGES AND FLAWS
Addiction
Value: - 1 or -2
A character with the Addiction Flaw is addicted to a psychoactive drug, substance or activity such as alcohol or BTL simsense chips. If forced to go without a "fix" for more than a few
hours, the character experiences withdrawal symptoms. While
under the influence of the substance, the character may be mildly
euphoric or totally incapacitated, depending on the substance.
The point value of an Addiction Flaw is based on the strength of
the substance's addictive qualities or its effects on the characterStrongly Addictive, Debilitating or Incapacitating-as noted in the
Addiction Table.
An addicted character who wants to "kick the habit" must
spend a number of Karma Points equal to ten times the point
value of his addiction (see Eliminating Flaws, p. 22.)
Animal Empathy
Value: 2
A character with the Animal Empathy Edge has an instinctive
feel for handling animals of all kinds. The character receives a -1
target modifier for all tests that involve influencing or controlling
an animal (including riding). Additionally, the character becomes
reluctant to harm animals. Animal Empathy does not affect a character's interactions with sentient creatures such as dragons.

At Ease
Value: 3
A character with the At Ease Edge can easily fit in with new
situations, new groups, new cities and new jobs. Whenever he or
she tries to fit into a new environment-infiltrating a group or trying to meet contacts in a new city-the character may use his or
her highest Etiquette Concentration appropriate for interactions.
Any non-player character who fails a Perception (4) Test treats the
character like a local. Additionally, all non-player characters have
a Friendly attitude toward the character on any future tests (see
the Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRII).
Bad Reputation
Value: - 1 to -4
A character with the Bad Reputation Flaw has a dark stain on
his or her reputation. Whether or not the stain is deserved, it
makes everyone react negatively to the character. The character
receives a +1 target modifier on all Social Skill Tests. Increase the
modifier by I for each point of Bad Reputation the character takes,
up to a maximum of 4. For example, a character who takes -4
points of Bad Reputation receives a +4 target modifier.
Blandness
Value: 2
The Blandness Edge enables a character to blend into any
crowd. Anyone who attempts to describe the character cannot
come up with anything more precise than "he was kinda average."
Any individual who attempts to track or physically locate the
character receives a +1 target modifier on all tests made during
such attempts. The target modifier does not apply to magical or
Matrix searches.
Day Job
Value: - 1 to -3
A character with the Day Job Flaw holds down a "real" Job
besides shadowrunning. A character's day job burdens him or her
with responsibilities and time requirements, but it may provide
certain advantages as well. A day job can offer a convenient way
to launder money, a "cover" persona that can come in handy if
law-enforcement people investigate the character, a network of
non-shadow contacts, and a little extra cash.
If desired, gamemasters may allow player characters to take
up to -3 points of Day Job. The following guidelines provide suggested monthly salaries for day jobs. Feel free to adjust these figures and restrict the characters' spending or choice of jobs.

A character with the Dark Secret Flaw has some terrible secret
whose revelation could have dreadful consequences. Such a character may have committed a horrible crime, may be the missing
heir of a murdered crime family, or may have worked for an organization such as the Universal Brotherhood or the Black Lodge.
just to name a few possibilities. Every two or three game sessions,
the gamemaster must orchestrate an event that threatens to
expose the secret and forces the character to work to conceal it.
If a character's dark secret is exposed, the Flaw may be
replaced with a corresponding level of Bad Reputation at the
gamemaster's discretion. Alternatively. the character may
attempt to redeem himself.
Dependent
Value: Variable
A character with the Dependent Flaw has a loved one who
depends on him or her for support and aid from time to time.
Dependents may include children, parents, a spouse, a sibling or
an old friend. Meeting the needs of a dependent should take up a
fair amount of the character's time, as well as some of the character's money. The gamemaster should set the point value of the
Flaw, according to the needs of the dependent and the demands
those needs place on the character.
Distinctive Style
Value: - 1
A character with Distinctive Style has a flair for the dramatic
in dress, behavior and speech, and simply can't stand not being
recognized for his or her work. Understandably, this makes the
character dangerously memorable at times.
A character who takes this Flaw must choose some way to
display his or her style. For example, a character might cultivate a
distinctive appearance by sporting a fluorescent green mohawk
and a Soviet army jacket at all times. Whatever type of flair a character selects, it must enable other individuals to easily remember
the character.
Elf Poser
Value: - 1
Elf Posers are human characters who want to be elves. This
desire prompts them to associate with elves as much as possible,
talk like elves, and alter their appearances so that they resemble
elves.
An Elf Poser character starts the game with a poor command
of Sperethiel; the character receives a +2 target modifier when
trying to understand or speak the language. Sperethiel-speakers
will laugh at the character's misspoken phrases ("You want to do
what to my dog? ... oh, you're trying to say "let's get something
to eat."). Additionally, elves treat the character with suspicion:
the character receives a +2 target modifier for Social Skill Tests
made against elves.

Characters who undergo cosmetic surgery to get "elf ears and
elf eyes" may successfully "pass" as elves and avoid the Social
Skill Test target modifier. However, if an elf discovers the character's secret, the elf treats him or her with contempt and Hostility
(see the Social Skill Table. p. 182, SRII).
Note that only human characters may take the Elf Poser Flaw.
Extra Contact
Value: 1
By spending 1 point, a character can receive | additional
Level 1 contact during character creation.
Extra Enemy
Value: - 1
By spending -1 point, a character can receive | additional
enemy during character creation (see Enemies, p. 71).
Friends Abroad
Value: 3
A character with Friends Abroad has a knack for making
friends everywhere he or she goes. The character starts the game
with an extra contact who must reside in a foreign land. (Because
the default setting for Shadowrun is Seattle, the extra contact
must be from outside UCAS territory, unless the game is based in
another country.) Alternatively, gamemasters may allow extra
contacts to reside in any major city other than the home city of the
campaign. The character must make an effort to maintain this contact-this may be as simple as sending e-mail messages. The
character must Indicate how he or she plans to maintain the contact when he or she takes the Edge, and the gamemaster must
approve the method. If the character fails to appropriately maintain the contact, he or she loses the contact permanently.
Additionally, the character can make new contacts in any foreign land he or she visits. To do so, the player chooses the individual contact (most likely someone his or her character worked with)
and, as above, describes for the gamemaster how the character will
cultivate that contact. The character must communicate with the foreign contact frequently for 1 year, then occasionally after that per
the Contact Upkeep rules, p. 62.
Friends in High Places
Value: 2
Characters with the Friends in High Places Edge have important, influential (Level 2) contacts-such as megacorporate VPs or
government officials, From time to time, such contacts can provide considerable help to a character-much more than a regular
contact can provide. These contacts will not risk their own positions to help a character, but will do anything short of that. A character who abuses his or her high-ranking contact's trust can quickly lose this Edge, however.
At the gamemaster's discretion, a character can have an even
higher-placed contact, such as a megacorporate CEO. However,
such individuals rarely have anything to do with lowly shadowrunners. Friendships with such immensely powerful individuals
often carry substantial risks as well as benefits.
Human-Looking
Value: 1
A metahuman character with the Human-Looking Edge can
"pass" for human in most circumstances. Human non-player characters respond with Neutral attitudes toward such characters
when making Social Skill Tests (p. 182, SRII). Additionally, human
non-player characters do not roll on the Racism Table (p. 182.
SRII) when interacting with a Human-Looking character, unless
they are in close proximity to the character.
Only elves, dwarfs, and orks can take the Human-Looking
Edge. Metahuman-variant characters (see Metahuman Variants,
p. 38) cannot take this Edge.
Hung Out to Dry
Value: - 4
For a reason chosen by the gamemaster, the character's contacts suddenly dry up-no one will talk to him or her. The character can try to find out what happened, or simply get on with his or
her life. Resolve the effects of this Flaw with roleplaying.
If desired, the resolution of this Flaw can become the subject
of an entire campaign. Such a story line can provide an opportunity for the character to redeem his or her reputation among the
character's contacts, or further antagonize them until they become
Enemies (see p. 71) and the character ends up with a permanent
Bad Reputation Flaw (p. 31).
Good Reputation
Value: 1 to 2
Deservedly or not, the character with this Edge enjoys a Good
Reputation that makes others trust and respect him or her. For
each point spent on Good Reputation, the character receives a -1
target modifier for Social Skill Tests.
Uncouth
Value: - 2
An Uncouth character has no social graces. Such characters
suffer a +2 target modifier on Social Skill Tests (including
Negotiation and Etiquette Tests).
This Flaw is common among street muscle-types, and many
professional shadowrunners consider it the mark of an amateur.
MAGICAL EDGES AND FLAWS
Bad Karma
Value: - 5
A character with the Bad Karma Flaw lives under the weight
of some black mark on his soul. This bad karma may result from a
past transgression or simply the bad luck of being born under the
wrong star. A character with the Bad Karma Flaw adds a point to
his Karma Pool for every 20 points of Karma he earns, rather than
every 10.
Bonus Force Point
Value: 1 to 3
For a cost of 1 point, a character gains 2 bonus Force Points.
The character can use the Force Points however he or she desires.

MAGICAL TALENT EDGE TABLE
Edge
Spellcasting Talent
Value
Description
The character has the innate ability to cast a single spell. The base Force Rating of the spell equals
the character's starting Magic Attribute - 1. The character can raise the Force Rating with spell
foci or initiation, If the spell can be cast through ritual sorcery, the character may do so if he or
she has the Sorcery Skill. Gamemasters may modify the point cost of the Edge for particularly
powerful or weak spell abilities.
Combat Spells
4 pts
Detection Spells
2 pts
Health Spells
3 pts
Illusion Spells
3 pts
Manipulation Spells 4 pts
Summoning Talent
3/5 pts
The character can summon one type of spirit-either watchers (a 3-point Edge) or a single type of
elemental or nature spirit (a 5-point Edge), such as an Earth elemental or a City spirit. The
character does not need to have the Conjuring Skill to have this talent. Characters can summon
only | spirit at a time.
Astral Sight
3 pts
The character can see into the astral plane through astral perception. However, characters cannot astrally project or make active use of any Magical Skills without the appropriate Magic
Priority allocation. Astrally active characters have all the normal abilities of astral perception
and can learn the Aura Reading Skill (p. 96, Awakenings).
Poor Link
2 pts
Any ritual sorcery directed against the character receives a +2 target modifier for the Link Test
portion of the ritual. Note that this Edge might work against a character in some circumstances.
such as when friendly magicians want to use ritual sorcery to locate or aid the character.
Players can purchase up to 6 bonus Force Points for their characters in this manner.
Focused Concentration
Value: 2
A magician character with Focused Concentration has naturally sharp concentration and is less easily distracted when sustaining spells. The character receives a +1 target modifier when
casting sustained spells. Additionally, the character can simultaneously sustain a number of spells equal to his or her Intelligence
Rating +1.
Magic Resistance
Value: 1 to 4
For each point spent on Magic Resistance, a character with this
Edge receives 1 additional die for Spell Resistance Tests. However,
the character cannot be magically active, and the Magical
Resistance Edge works against even beneficial spells such as Heal.
Magical Talent
Value: Variable
Only magically active characters with active Magic Ratings of
1 or higher can purchase any of the Magical Talent Edges listed on
the table above. A character whose Magic Rating drops below 1
automatically loses all Magical Talent Edges.
MISCELLANEOUS EDGES AND FLAWS
Cortex/Cranial Bomb
Value: - 6
Someone has planted a cortex or cranial bomb in the character's head (see p. 27. Cybertechnology, for bomb variants). The
gamemaster decides who planted it and what that person or
group wants. The player need not pay for the bomb with the character's starting Resource points-the bomb's a freebie.
If the character manages to disarm the bomb, the gamemaster may elect to replace it with Extra Enemies, Bad Reputation,
Amnesia, a Phobia, an Addiction or any other Flaw(s) worth an
equal number of points.
Hunted
Value: - 2, -4 or -6
The character's Enemies (see p. 71) aggressively hunt down
the character. If the Enemy is killed, a new one takes its place, with
a starting rank equal to that of the previous Enemy when he, she
or it died. The life of the Hunted never gets easier, only harder.
2 point Flaw: A Rank 3 Enemy: or add 1 point to an existing
Enemy.
4 point Flaw: A Rank 4 Enemy: or add 2 points to an existing Enemy.
6 point Flaw: A Rank 5 or 6 Enemy (subject to gamemaster's
approval): or add 3 points to an existing Enemy.

Mysterious Cyberware/Bioware
Value: - 3
The character has a mysterious piece of cyberware in his body
of which he is unaware. The gamemaster chooses the cyberware,
and the character does not become aware of its existence until the
gamemaster chooses to reveal it-perhaps by having it kick in at
an inconvenient time or show up on a detector when the character tries to travel or pass unnoticed into a corporate environment.
As soon as the character discovers and eliminates or otherwise neutralizes the cyberware, the gamemaster can replace the
Flaw with Extra Enemies, Bad Reputation, Amnesia, a Phobia, an
Addiction or any other Flaw(s) worth an equal number of points.
Police Record
Value: - 6
A character with the Police Record Flaw has fought the law
and lost. The character's resulting police record has a number of
effects.
First, all of the character's contacts must be street level (corp
types don't hang with ex-jailbirds). Second, most corporate security departments will have a record of the character's face and
cyberware, plus a description of his or her modus operandi. Third.
Lone Star has copies of the character's records, names, numbers
and so on. Lone Star patrolmen recognize the character and
harass him or her on sight. Fourth, the character can never obtain
a legal SIN, and has to call his or her parole officer every two days
and check in with him once a week. The parole officer knows
where the character lives, knows his or her usual contacts, and can
legally break down the character's door any time he wants.
If the character's record is
expunged or the character
successfully ditches his or her
past life, the gamemaster may
replace the Police Record Flaw
with Hung Out to Dry, Bad
Reputation, Extra Enemies or
another Flaw(s) of equal point
value.
Registered Equipment
Value: 6
A character with Registered
Equipment has all the permits
needed to legally possess and
carry restricted foci and Class
C cyberware within the UCAS
(or primary country of his or
her campaign). Of course,
these permits raise the suspicions of fellow shadowrunners
and others who mistrust the
authorities. As long as the
character carries his or her permits, however, he or she will
not be arrested for possessing
the illegal item. Of course,
that may not stop the authorities from closely watching the character. Furthermore, the authorities can claim that the character has
violated the law with the registered equipment and cancel the
permits without warning.
To purchase the Registered Equipment Edge, a character
must have a valid SIN and be registered as a citizen in the country where the campaign takes place.
State-of-the-Art Model
Value: 2, 4 or 6
The State-of-the-Art Model Edge enables characters to possess state-of-the-art bioware and cyberware unavailable to most
runners. This Edge can easily disrupt the balance of a game.
Gamemasters should carefully consider its use in their games and
prohibit it if they choose. Gamemasters may also find the optional Availability rules (see p. 90) useful for controlling the use of
bioware and cyberware in their games,
Players may purchase 2-point, 4-point and 6-point versions
of State-of-the-Art Model. A 2-point State-of-the-Art Model Edge
provides a character with access to Availability 10 bioware and
cyberware and alpha-grade implant technology. A 4-point Edge
provides access to Availability 20 cultured bioware and cyberware
and beta-grade implant technology. A 6-point Edge provides
access to delta-grade cyberware of any Availability.
State-of-the-Art does not affect the standard costs of bioware
and cyberware.
To prevent players from using this Edge to create virtually
invincible characters, gamemasters may require any character
who possesses State-of-the-Art Model to also have a Flaw such as
Extra Enemy, Hung Out to Dry or Cortex Bomb.

NEW CHARACTER TYPES
Practically since the Introduction of
Shadowrun to the gaming world, players
have requested rules for playing shapeshifter
characters-Awakened animals with the
magical ability to assume human form (p.
230. SRII)-and other metatypes. The following rules allow players and gamemasters
to create shapeshifter characters and provide
guidelines and examples for creating additional metatypes. As always, gamemasters
have the final say on whether or not to
include these new character types in their games.

SHAPESHIFTER ADVANTAGES
Shapeshifter player characters enjoy three innate advantages
over other characters: the ability to shift between animal and
human forms, a dual nature and superior regenerative powers.
Animal/Human Form
The ability to shift between animal and human forms is the
primary advantage and distinguishing characteristic of
shapeshifters. As noted in the preceding section, shapeshifters
receive various Attribute bonuses in both animal and human
forms.
To switch between forms, a shapeshifter must spend a
Complex Action. The transformation from human to animal does
not include any of the shapeshifter's equipment or clothing; clothing will be ripped and equipment may be damaged during the
transformation if the character does not remove it first.
When in animal form. a shapeshifter resembles a mundane
member of its species; only its astral presence distinguishes it
from a mundane animal. A shapeshifter in animal form can communicate with other members of its species, but cannot speak or
use Social skills. Shapeshifter magicians in animal form can cast
spells, but cannot use Centering skills or fulfill geasa that their
beast-forms cannot perform. In animal form a shapechanger cannot use his or her physical adept powers. They are only usable in
human form.

CREATING A SHAPESHIFTER
In general, though some shapeshifters mingle with metahuman society and even work as shadowrunners, most shapeshifters
prefer to live in wilderness areas, apart from civilization.
The Shapeshifter Character Creation Table illustrates the priority options available to shapeshifter characters. Note that all
shapeshifter characters must assign Priority A to Race.
Shapeshifter characters purchase their base Attributes and skills
per standard rules. Base Attribute Ratings may not exceed 6.
Next, consult the Shapeshifter Attribute Modifiers Table and
calculate the character's final Attribute ratings. Apply the Human
Form modifiers to the base Attribute ratings to determine the
Attributes of the character in human form. Use the Animal Form
modifiers to calculate the Attributes of the character in animal
form. These final Attribute ratings are not subject to any racial
maximums or other limits.
The table provides modifiers for the six shapeshifter species
described in SRII: Bear, Fox. Leopard, Seal, Tiger and Wolf. All of
these species are suitable for shapeshifter player characters.

A shapeshifter in human form possesses all the characteristics
of a normal human. Typically, a few of a shapeshifter's
features vaguely resemble the equivalent features
of its animal form (the shape of its eyes, the color
of its hair), but the shapeshifter otherwise appears human.
Dual Nature
Shapeshifters are dual-natured
creatures-they exist on the physical
and astral planes simultaneously.
Consequently, they can use astral
perception at any time as a Simple
Action. They also suffer all the disadvantages of having a dual nature:
because they cannot shut off their astral
presence, shapeshifters are vulnerable
to detection and attack on the astral;
magical barriers such as wards block
the movement of shapeshifters' astral
forms; and the movement of their astral
form is limited by the movement of
their physical bodies.
A shapeshifter's astral form
always appears as an idealized
image of its animal form, regardless
of the shapeshifter's current form. This
means that a shapeshifter in human
form can be detected by astral perception unless he is an initiate
capable of Masking.
Shapeshifter magicians with
the appropriate Magic Priority can
also use astral projection when
in human form. Their astral statistics are equal to their Physical
Attributes.
Regeneration Rules
The following rules apply to
shapeshifter player characters only.
For shapeshifter gamemaster characters, use the regeneration rules provided in SRII.
Note that shapeshifter player
characters lose all special regenerative
powers when in human form. A shapeshifter who
takes damage in human form and remains in human
form heals according to the standard Shadowrun rules.
A shapeshifter who takes damage in human form
can shift to animal form (spending a Complex Action) and heal
a number of Damage boxes equal to half the animal form's
Essence Rating, rounded down, at the end of each turn.
A shapeshifter who takes damage in animal form and remains
in animal form heals a number of Damage boxes equal to his animal form's Essence Rating, rounded down, at the end of each turn.
A shapeshifter is virtually immune to death from injury when in animal form, unless an injury damages its brain or spinal cord.
Whenever a shapeshifter takes Deadly damage. roll ID6. On
a result of 1. the shapeshifter dies. If the damage results from
massive tissue injury (burns, trauma and such), the shapeshifter
dies on a result of 1 or 2. If the character does not die, he or she
can heal a number of Damage boxes at a rate equal to his or her
Essence Rating, rounded down, at the end of each turn.
Despite these impressive regenerative powers, shapeshifter
characters are not indestructible. If a shapeshifter takes damage
equal to or greater than his or her Body Rating + 10, the character dies, regardless of his or her form.
A shapeshifter magician who survives Deadly damage must
still check for magic loss per standard rules. Additionally,
shapeshifter magicians regenerate the Physical damage caused by
spellcasting Drain at a rate of | Damage box per minute. If a
shapeshifter takes Deadly Physical damage from Drain, the player
character rolls 1D6; the character dies on a result of 1 or 2.
Note that these rules do not apply to damage from silver
weapons (see Silver Allergy/Vulnerability, below).
SHAPESHIFTER DISADVANTAGES
Shapeshifter player characters are hampered by three disadvantages: their bestial natures, silver allergies and the Inability to
receive cyberware implants.
Bestial Nature
Though shapeshifters can assume human form, they are animals at heart. Consequently, powerful animal instincts and emotions drive all shapeshifter characters. Even those who have
learned to speak metahuman languages and have assimilated into
civilized culture remain beasts at their core, and occasionally act
in ways that may horrify even the most hardened shadowrunner.
Understandably. most governments-including the UCAS.
CAS and California administrations-do not grant shapeshifters
metahuman status. These governments consider shapeshifters no
more than wild animals. The NAN government accords more
rights to shapeshifters, but does not recognize them as full citizens because of their inability to adhere to metahuman rules and
social mores. In nearly all cases, government authorities do not
hesitate to destroy criminal shapeshifters as they would a rabid
dog.
Because of their bestial nature, shapeshifter player characters
do not receive the standard free contacts during character creation. Instead, they must purchase any starting contacts with their
allocated Resource Points. However, few metahumans entirely
trust a shapeshifter.
Silver Allergy/Vulnerability
Every shapeshifter has both a Severe Allergy and Vulnerability
to silver. The mere touch of the metal causes a shapeshifter pain
and burn-like welts. To withstand the urge to retreat from contact
with silver, a shapeshifter must make a successful Willpower (6)
Test. Weapons made from silver or coated with it receive a +2
Power bonus and a +1 Wound Level bonus against shapeshifters.
For example, a 4L knife made of silver would do 6M damage to a
shapeshifter.
Additionally, shapeshifters recover damage caused by silver
weapons at a rate of | Damage box per minute. Damage from silver weapons accumulates and kills a shapeshifter per standard
rules. If a shapeshifter takes Deadly damage from a combination
of silver and non-silver weapons, roll 1D6; the character dies on a
result of 1 or 2.
Cyberware Rejection
Shapeshifters cannot willingly accept any type of cyberware
implants. Their regenerative powers cause shapeshifters' bodies
to reject all cyberware as soon as they shift to animal form.
Particularly sadistic rumor-mongers occasionally suggest that
un-named governments have found a way to restrict criminal
shapeshifters to their human forms by implanting cyberware into
their human bodies in especially damaging ways.
METAHUMAN VARIANTS
Like their human counterparts, metahumans come in a broad
range of colors, creeds and ethnic backgrounds. Nearly all possess
the basic metahuman qualities described in SRII, but members of
metahuman-variant subgroups may also possess unique characteristics. The following entries describe a few metahuman-variant
subgroups. Players and gamemasters can use these descriptions
as guidelines for introducing different types of metahuman characters into their Shadowrun games.
Because they possess such unique physical characteristics.
even other metahumans consider the metahuman variants
described in this book to be, well, freaks. These characters receive
a Hostile reaction (Social Skill Table, p. 182, SRII) in all initial social
contacts with other metahumans. Players and gamemasters also
must find creative ways for these characters to manage everyday
life-just where does a giant sleep, how does he hold a fork, how
does he travel-heck, he can't even fit through most doors!
METAHUMAN ALBINISM
The condition of albinism continues to exist in the world of
Shadowrun, and all races manifest albino members. The typical
manifestations of an albino remain essentially the same: a deficiency in skin and hair pigmentation, usually appearing as white
hair or skin, and eyes showing a pink or blue iris with a bright red
pupil. In Shadowrun, albinos' skin, eyes, and hair can also take on
a silvery hue, they are often noticeably thinner and taller than
average for their race, and they suffer a Mild allergy to sunlight.
There is no character creation priority change for albinism, though
an albino character must have at least one of the following Flaws
(see p. 25-27) without gaining the value of the Flaw in Build
Points or in an equal Edge: Bio-rejection, Color Blind, Low Pain
Tolerance, Night Blindness or Sensitive System. The player can
take more than one of the above Flaws for an albino character.
Each additional Flaw beyond the required one provides the
appropriate number of Build Points or can be balanced with an
Edge. Albino characters have responded positively to the increase
in mana and gain +1 to Willpower in addition to any other
Willpower increase they receive at character creation.

VARIANTS
Cyclops (Troll)
Greek and Mediterranean trolls, known as cyclops, are often larger and more heavily muscled than other trolls. They lack most of the dermal bone deposits common
among trolls, but are most easily distinguished by the fact that they have only a single eye located in the middle of their foreheads. All cyclops either have only one horn or, in rare instances, no horns.  Cyclops receive the standard troll racial modifications with the following exceptions: +6 Strength (Attribute maximum 10) and no Dermal Armor. 
Cyclops also receive a +2 target modifier for ranged attacks because they lack depth perception.

Koborokuru (Dwarf)
Japanese dwarfs, called koborokuru, are slightly smaller than their Western counterparts and possess extensive body hair. Like other metahumans, koborokuru are not looked upon kindly in Japanese society. In fact, Japanese anti-metahuman prejudice has saddled koborokuru with an undeserved reputation as rude and primitive individuals. Like gnomes, koborokuru prefer rural and wilderness areas over urban environments. 
Koborokuru receive the standard dwarf racial modifications, with the following exception: no Quickness penalty.

Fomori (Troll)
Fomori are Irish/Celtic trolls. They lack dermal bone deposits, but are more powerful than most other trolls and are generally considered comparatively attractive by other races. Like many metahumans of Celtic descent, fomori possess a higher-than-average propensity for magical ability. 
Fomori receive the standard troll racial modifications with the following exceptions: +4 Body, +3 Strength, no Dermal Armor and no Charisma penalty.

Menehune (Dwarf)
The menehune, or Children of the Land, are named for the original "little people" of Hawai'l. Menehune are shorter than most dwarfs and possess luxuriant body hair, thick muscles, large noses, bushy eyebrows and stringy hair. According to local legends, the menehune's ancestors came from the lost continent of Mu, or Atlantis, but modern biologists and anthropologists place little stock in such fables. 
Menehune receive the standard dwarf racial modifications, with the following exception: +2 Body.

Hobgoblin (Ork)
The hobgoblins of the Middle East are smaller and slighter than most ork variants. Hobgoblins' greenish skin tones, sharp teeth and dark, beady eyes give them a fierce appearance, which has contributed to general antimetahuman prejudice in the Middle East, especially among Fundamentalist sects. Hobgoblins are also distinguished by their vicious tempers and strong sense of personal honor, which demands that hobgoblins avenge any slight or disrespect directed toward them. 
Hobgoblins receive the standard ork racial modifications, with the following exceptions: +2 Body and no Intelligence penalty.

Giants (Troll)
Nordic trolls, or giants, are fairer and taller than other trolls. The average giant stands 3.5 meters tall, and most lack horns and the dermal bone deposits common to their race. For as-yetunknown reasons, giants seem to have a greater than average tendency toward genetic reversions-one out of every four female infants born to giant mothers is human (homo sapiens sapiens). Giants possess the standard troll racial modifications with the following exceptions: +5 Strength and no Dermal Armor. Gnomes (Dwarf) Members of the gnome subgroup inhabit Central Europe and Asia Minor. Gnomes are distinguished from common dwarfs by longer noses and a shorter, more childlike physique. Gnomes tend to favor rural environments over urban settings. Most cling to the behaviors traditionally attributed to their race by mythology and seem unnerved by modern technology. All known magical gnomes are shamans. 
Gnomes receive the standard dwarf racial modifications, with the following exception: +2 Willpower. 

Oni (Ork)
Japanese orks, or onl, have bright red, blue or orange skin. Less apparent physical characteristics include slightly protuberant eyes: enlarged, pointed ears; and horns. Additionally, oni display a higher than average propensity for magical ability. Oni are reputedly treacherous and hostile, but this view seems more a product of Japanese anti-metahuman prejudice than of any inherent oni characteristics. At the gamemaster's discretion, players creating magical oni characters may select Resources as Priority A, Race as Priority B and Magic as Priority C. 
All non-magical oni use the regular metahuman Priority assignments. 

Wakyambi (Elf)
The wakyambi are an extremely rare elven subgroup native to Africa. The wakyambi often lack pointed ears and are noticeably thinner and taller than other elves, many growing as tall as trolls and a rare few even taller. Wakyambi almost always possess black or brown skin. though rare albino wakyambi are known to exist, characterized by white skin, no body hair and red eyes. All known albino wakyambi shun the modern world and live deep within the jungles of the African heartland. Numerous African legends refer to a group known as the Heaven People that has given many gifts to humans over the millennia, for their own mysterious reasons, Those legends describe the Heaven People as closely resembling the wakyambi. Seeking to gain the prestige, reverence and other benefits accorded to the wakyambi, some nonwakyambi African elves claim to be members of the Heaven People-but no true wakyambi ever makes such a claim. The wakyambi receive the standard elf racial modifications, with the following exceptions: increase Willpower by +1, no Quickness bonus. 

Ogre (Ork)
Members of the European ogre subgroup are shorter and stockier than most orks. They possess smoother skin and less body and head hair than other orks, as well as pronounced jaw lines. Ogres receive the standard ork racial modifications, but do not suffer a Charisma penalty. 

Minotaurs (Troll)
Minotaurs are an unusual Mediterranean mutation of the troll metatype, distinguished by pronounced snouts in place of noses, wide-set eyes, long horns and extensive body hair. They possess the standard troll racial modifications, except adjust the following Attributes by 1: Body (+4), Strength (+3), Charisma and Intelligence (-1). 

Satyr (Ork)
Members of the Mediterranean satyr subgroup often possess relatively small physical builds, furry lower bodies, cloven hooves and small, curly horns. Popular myth to the contrary, satyrs are not all musicians or "party animals." Nearly all satyrs possess magical abilities and follow the way of the shaman. Most follow the totem of Bacchus (use the Coyote totem statistics, p. 120, SRII). This totem resembles the Greek god of the same name. Though metahuman satyrs are often confused with wild satyrs (p. 86, Paranormal Animals of Europe), members of the ork-satyr subgroup are fully sentient metahumans. Satyrs have-1 Quickness due to their hooves and a +1 bonus to Willpower.

The Night Ones (Elf)
A mostly European metavariant of elves, known by their own choice as the Night Ones, possesses the distinguishing physical characteristic of fine fur covering their bodies. This layer of fur is love indistinguishable from skin at a distance, but the fact that the fur ranges in color from black to violet to blue, with some rare examples of green and very deep orange, makes this metavariant quickly apparent at close range. The Night Ones' hair and eyes are usually a tint of their skin color, though a few rare Night Ones have silver hair and eyes. Because the most common colors of fur are the dark shades, the general public almost immediately dubbed these elves the Dark Elves. Despite popular urban myth, however, the Night Ones are not a cult or an "evil" elven subgroup. Found mainly in Europe, an increasing number of Night Ones have been appearing in the Tir nations. Night Ones have a mild allergy to sunlight and so prefer to live and work at night, but otherwise they resemble other elves. The Night Ones receive the standard elf racial modifications. with the following exceptions: Mild allergy to sunlight. +2 Quickness. 

Dryads (Elf)
Dryads are an all-female metavariant of elves characterized by an average height of just more than 1 meter and hair color that appears to change with the seasons of the areas in which they live (for example, brown or white in winter months, bright green in the summer and various oranges, reds and yellows in the autumn months). All dryads have dark brown eyes with no visible pupils. No matter where they are born, all dryads migrate to forested or wooded areas as soon as they are capable of traveling on their own-the further away from the urban sprawl, the better. The longer they live in these isolated areas, the more feral they become, in a voluntary separation from society that includes speaking a language only other dryads understand. While scientific studies cannot pinpoint any specific medical reason for it, dryads exhibit a Mild allergy to urban areas, displaying all the physical and mental strains common to any allergy sufferer whenever they travel away from their home. All known dryads are shamans who follow a variation of the Great Mother totem (see p. 152, Awakenings; p. 149. Germany Sourcebook). The dryads call their totem Father Tree, but the game stats are the same. Dryads receive the standard elf racial modifications, with the following exceptions: Mild allergy to urban areas. - 1 Strength. - 1 Body, +3 Charisma bonus, and a limited version of the Edge Animal Empathy (this Edge does not need to be balanced by a Flaw; see p. 30). For dryads, the Animal Empathy Edge only affects birds and small treeliving animals like squirrels and chipmunks.

In Shadowrun, a character's various skills largely define his or her overall abilities. Consequently, the
use and Improvement of skills is one of the most important aspects of character development in
Shadowrun. This section presents material designed to fine-tune and expand the basic skill system
to provide more satisfying play.
The section includes a revised version of the basic Skill Web, clarification of the Skill Web default
rules and Dice Pool rules, and optional training rules that enable players to Improve their characters'
skills and Attributes during the course of play.
REVISED SKILL WEB
The Skill Web (p. 69, SRII) is probably the most used-and abused-component of the Shadowrun
game system. The following revised Skill Web has been designed to correct a few of the most common
problems associated with the Skill Web, and reflects additions made to the game since the original Skill
Web was first published.
The revised Skill Web exchanges the positions of the Biotech and Cybertechnology skills. This
change reflects the fact that Biotech is used to provide first ald as well as basic medical treatment, while
Cybertechnology represents knowledge of advanced cybermedical procedures. This change makes
Biotech relatively easier to default to, and makes defaulting to Cybertechnology as difficult as defaulting
to the Computer and Electronic Build and Repair (B/R) skills.
The revised Skill Web includes the new Psychometry and Enchanting Skills introduced in the
Awakenings sourcebook. It also includes an extra dot between the Vehicle B/R Skills and the Reaction

Attribute. This revision reflects the difficulty of building and repairing a vehicle compared to the relative ease of driving one. The
revised Skill Web also contains the new skill Instruction, used
when teaching or training a player character in a new skill (see
Training with an Instructor, p. 51).
Finally, the new Skill Web enables characters to default to
Intelligence for any B/R Skill Test.
REVISED DEFAULT RULES
Long ago, many Shadowrun players discovered they could
use the Skill Web rules to substitute other abilities for their characters' skills and enable their characters to accomplish feats that
they would otherwise be incapable of performing. Such use of the
Skill Web violates the basic idea behind it, however, and negates
the challenge of succeeding within a character's limitations. The
following rules and guidelines are designed to close the loopholes
that allowed such abuses and provide more challenging and
rewarding play.
DEFAULT SKILL/ATTRIBUTE LIMITS
Limiting the feats that characters can perform with default
skills or Attributes is one way that gamemasters can discourage
players from misusing the Skill Web. Remember, a character uses
a default skill or Attribute in place of a specific skill suited to a particular task. However, the default skill/Attribute will never be suited to the task as well as the original skill. Therefore, the character
should not be able to accomplish the task as well as someone who
uses the skill itself.
For example, just because a character can default to
Intelligence from the Cybertechnology Skill does not mean that
Intelligence alone should enable the average runner to sit down and
design a delta-grade move-by-wire system. Or take the case of a
street samurai who's riding shotgun in his friend Zippy's LAV. When
a lucky shot geeks Zippy, the street samurai must control the LAV
himself. He doesn't have the Vectored Thrust Skill, so he defaults to
Reaction to make the Vectored Thrust Test. With some luck, his high
Reaction might enable him to keep the craft in the air and maybe
even land it safely. But without the Vectored Thrust Skill, he would
not know how to read the LAV's control panel, use the LAN to plot
way-points, or perform other advanced piloting tasks,
TASK-APPROPRIATE DEFAULT SKILLS
The Skill Web is simply a guide to linking loosely related
skills. Most related skills share only a few similar aspects, and so
every gamemaster should use his or her own judgment to decide
whether any proposed default skill/Attribute is appropriate for a
given task. If a player wants to default to a skill that is totally unrelated to the task. the gamemaster may simply forbid it.
Charlie wants to program the micro-control circuitry on a new set of wired reflexes. Normally, this
would require a Cybertechnology Test, but Charlie
lacks Cybertechnology, so he asks the gamemaster if
he can default to his Computer Skill for the task. The
gamemaster approves. The two skills are connected
on the Skill Web, but more important, a character
with Computer Skill would plausibly have the knowledge needed to program such circuitry. So Charlie's
Computer Skill would be appropriate for the task.
Later in the game, Diana decides she wants to
Implant some cyberware into one of her fellow runners, a task that normally requires a Cybertechnology
Test, Diana doesn't have the Cybertechnology Skill
either, so she asks the gamemaster if she can default
to her Computer Theory Skill. The gamemaster
rejects this request, because the Computer Theory
Skill would not plausibly give a character the knowledge required to perform surgery.
Task-Appropriate Modifiers
In cases where the appropriateness of a proposed default
skill/Attribute is not as clear cut, gamemasters may allow the
character to use the default skill/Attribute but add a +1 taskappropriate target modifier to the test. The task-appropriate modifier is added to any other default modifiers for the test.
Oak needs to make an Etiquette (Street) Test to
enlist the aid of some local gangers on a run. Oak
doesn't have that skill, so he asks the gamemaster if
he can default to his Leadership Skill. The gamemaster okays the request. The two skills are not quite the
same, but he figures that a runner could use either
skill to persuade some gangers to help him.
However, the gamemaster also considers that
the gangers may not like being given orders (part of
the reason why the task calls for an Etiquette Test).
Therefore, he adds a +1 target modifier to the test.
Along with the +2 target modifier for defaulting from
Etiquette to Leadership, that produces a final +3 target modifier for the test.
For roleplaying purposes, gamemasters should also consider
how the use of individual default skills/Attributes affects characters' actions. In the preceding example, Oak would be likely to
bark orders at the gangers, rather than persuade them to help.
Oak's approach. of course, will partially determine how the
gangers react.
PARTIAL DEFAULTING
Under the old Skill Web rules, a character with a low-level
skill had two options when a test required using that ability. He or
she could simply use the skill against the test's base target number, or the character could use the Skill Web and default to a nearby skill or Attribute, accepting a higher target number in exchange
for more dice on the test.
The partial default rule provides a compromise between
these two choices. When partially defaulting to a skill or Attribute,
calculate the average of the original skill rating and the default
skill/Attribute rating. The character then uses that average rating
for the test. The test target modifier equals half of the target modifier incurred for a standard default.

Fenris has Athletics 2 and Quickness 10, so he
decides to partially default to his Quickness when
he's faced with an Athletics (4) Test. He calculates
the average of his Quickness and Athletics ratings
(10 + 2 = 12, 12 + 2 - 6) to determine his rating for
the test: 6. One dot lies between Athletics and
Quickness on the Skill Web, which yields a +2 target
modifier on a standard default between the two.
Because Fenris is using the partial default rule, however, the target modifier is only +1.
Fenris's partial default enables him to roll 6 dice
against a Target Number 5 for the test.
DEFAULTING FROM
CONCENTRATIONS/SPECIALIZATIONS
Normally, a character attempting a task that falls outside of
his Concentration or Specialization would simply use his general
skill for the task. In some cases, however, the difference between
the ratings of the character's general skill and his Concentration or
Specialization is quite large. In these cases, the character may
want to use the Skill Web to default to the general skill.
To default from a Concentration or Specialization to the general skill, use the following rules. One dot separates each
Concentration from its general skill on the Skill Web. Therefore, a
character who defaults to a general skill from a Concentration
receives a +2 target modifier for his or her test. Each Specialization
is half a dot (+1 target modifier) away from its corresponding
Concentration; thus, defaulting to a general skill from a
Specialization adds a +3 target modifier.
Keep in mind that a character incurs no default modifier if he
uses his own general skill rating for tasks that require one of the
skill's Concentrations or Specializations. Similarly, a character
incurs no default modifier if he or she uses a Concentration for
tasks that require one of a skill's Specializations.

Iceman has Firearms 3, Firearms (Pistols) 5, and
Firearms (Colt Manhunter) 7. On one particular run,
he finds himself facing an armored troll. He needs a
bit more firepower than his trusty Colt can provide,
so he picks up a nearby Ares HVAR rifle. The test has
a Target Number 4.
Iceman's Concentration doesn't cover rifles, so
he has two options for the test. He can use his general Firearms 3, or he can use the Skill Web and
default from his Firearms (Colt Manhunter)
Specialization to Firearms. One and a half dots separate the two skills, so the test receives a +3 target
modifier for a final Target Number 7. That's higher
than the original target number, but Iceman's
Firearms (Colt Manhunter) 7 gives him more dice to
roll as well.
When Iceman sees that the HVAR is having little effect on the troll, he picks up a Panther assault
cannon from a nearby corpse and takes aim. Again,
the test begins at a base Target Number 4. Because
the Panther is a heavy weapon, Iceman must default
to the Gunnery Skill in order to use this gun, beginning with either his general Firearms Skill (3 dice) or
Firearms (Colt Manhunter) Specialization (7 dice).
Defaulting from Firearms adds a +2 target modifier to
the target number (1 dot separates Gunnery and
Firearms on the Skill Web). Defaulting from Firearms
(Colt Manhunter) adds a +5 target modifier (2-1/2
dots separate Gunnery and the specialization).
Because Iceman's general Firearms rating is only 3.
he decides to use his Specialization and make a
Firearms (Colt Manhunter) (9) Test.
OPTIONAL DICE POOLS
Dice Pools reflect the effects of Attribute or skill ratings on a
character's ability to perform a task. As experienced players
know. a Dice Pool provides extra dice that a player can add to
those normally allotted for a test. The basic Shadowrun rules offer
four types of Dice Pools: the Combat Pool, the Magic Pool, the
Control Pool and the Hacking Pool. Each pool can be used to supplement a specific type of test. (See p. 32, SRII, for more details.)
Some players feel that their characters are at a disadvantage
in Shadowrun games because those characters lack a Dice Pool to
supplement their most important and most frequently used skills.
The following three Dice Pools provide examples of optional
pools that gamemasters may wish to add to their games to
accommodate those characters. Feel free to create additional Dice
Pools to sult the specific conditions of your campaign.
ATHLETICS POOL
Player characters can use dice from the Athletics Pool on any
Athletic Skill Tests, such as Climbing and Lifting Tests.
To determine a character's Athletic Pool dice, add his or her
Quickness and Strength Ratings, divide by 2 and round down. The
number of Athletic Pool dice cannot exceed the character's base
Athletics Skill Rating.
SOCIAL POOL
Characters can use Social Pool dice on any Social Skill Tests,
such as Etiquette or Negotiation Tests.
To determine a character's Social Pool Dice, add his or her
Charisma and Intelligence Ratings, divide by 2 and round down.

The number of Social Pool dice cannot exceed the rating of the

DODGE POOL
Characters can use Dodge Pool dice on any Resistance Tests
made to resist damage taken from firearms, projectile or throwing weapons. To create the Dodge Pool, "transfer" half the
Combat Pool dice to the Dodge Pool. Use the remaining Combat
Pool dice for offensive actions, and the Dodge Pool dice for defensive actions.
OPTIONAL TRAINING RULES
Technically, player characters can simply purchase skill and
Attribute improvements with Good Karma points (see p. 190.
SRII). However, gamemasters can more accurately simulate the
time and dedication needed to improve a skill by requiring player characters to spend time training when they want to improve
skills or Attributes.
SKILL-IMPROVEMENT TRAINING
Under the training rules, the time a character must spend to
improve a skill depends on the type of skill being learned, as
shown on the Skill Improvement Table.
The training time requirements apply to Concentrations and
Specializations in the skills as well. Every Concentration and
Specialization must be improved separately.
Characters can reduce the base training time by making a Skill
Test using the skill they are improving (this test represents how
quickly the character comprehends new topics and relates them
to his existing ability in the skill). The base target number is equal
to the new skill rating being trained for plus 2. If the character has
used the skill often in game play, especially in stressful situations,
the gamemaster can apply a -1 target modifier to the Skill Test.
(Gamemasters may adjust this modifier to suit the character and
game situation, if desired.) Characters may also reduce their training time by enlisting the aid of a live or virtual instructor (see
Training with an Instructor, p. 51).
Characters may also use the Skill Web to default to another
skill or Attribute for the above test, per standard rules.
To calculate the final training time, divide the base time by
the number of successes achieved on the Skill Test. If the character achieves no successes, multiply the base training time by 1.5
and round up.
Generally, training time must be uninterrupted-otherwise
the required time period increases. If the character does not
train for a number of days equal to
his or her Intelligence Rating plus the
new skill rating, he must allow for
extra training time. The extra time
equals the number of days remaining
in the required training time, multiplied by 2. This extra training time
reflects how long the character must
spend "getting back up to speed."
Characters may incur extra training
time an unlimited number of times.
Sasser wants to raise her Medicine Skill from 2 to
3. Medicine is a Concentration of Biology, a knowledge skill, so the improvement will cost 4 Karma
Points. That means a required training time of 60 days
(required Karma Points 4 × 15 for knowledge skills).
That seems like a long time, so Sasser decides to make
a Medicine Test to reduce the required time. The
Target Number is 5 (new skill rating + 2). Sasser rarely
uses her Medicine Skill, so the gamemaster declines to
reduce the target number with a modifier.
The test yields 2 successes, which produces a
final training time of 30 days (base training time of 60
days + 2). So, after training for 30 days, Sasser can
spend 4 Good Karma Points to raise her Medicine
Rating to 3.
After training for 25 days, however, Sasser
needs to go on a run. The run goes poorly, and
Sasser doesn't make it back to Seattle until 14 days
have passed. That's a problem. Sasser has
Intelligence 5, and the new Skill Rating is 3-so any
time she misses 8 or more days of training for the
improvement, she must add extra training time. She
had only 5 days left in the original training time when
she stopped, so she must now train for 10 days to
improve the skill (remaining days x 2 - extra training time).
LEARNING A NEW SKILL
Though the Shadowrun rules have always allowed player
characters to learn new skills during the course of the game (postcharacter creation), no guidelines existed to indicate what characters needed to do in order to gain new skills (see pp. 190-91.
SRII) . Characters can learn new skills through self-directed study
(the do-it-yourself method), or by training with a live or virtual
instructor. Generally, characters can use the do-it-yourself method
to learn only skills related to those the character already possesses (see the revised Skill Web, p. 47). At their discretion, however,
individual gamemasters may drop this restriction, limit it to certain specific skills, or even expand the restriction.
DO-IT-YOURSELF METHOD
The do-it-yourself method enables characters to learn new
skills without the aid of an instructor. This method often makes
learning more difficult, and even dangerous at times (especially

when learning skills such as Demolitions, Biotech or Vectored
Thrust Piloting, to name a few). In addition to these commonsense examples, the gamemaster may otherwise restrict the
choice of skills that a character can learn on his own.
The base training time to learn a new skill is 30 days. A player can reduce this time for his characters by making a Skill (4) Test
for the new skill. Because the character does not yet possess the
skill, the player must make the test with a related skill that the
character already possesses. (At the gamemaster's discretion,
characters may default to an Attribute for the test). All standard
default rules and target modifiers apply.
To determine the final training time required to learn the new
skill, divide the base training time (30 days) by the number of successes from the test. If the test yields no successes, multiply the
base training time by 1.5 to calculate the final training time. At the
end of the training period, the character possesses the new skill.
(Characters who interrupt their training may incur extra training
time, as noted in Skill-Improvement Training, p. 50).
Characters always learn new skills at Skill Rating 1.
Phantom wants to learn Demolitions-in game
terms, he wants Demolitions 1. The gamemaster is
allowing characters to default to Attributes when
leaming new skills, so the player running Phantom
decides to default to his character's Intelligence for the
test he makes to reduce the standard 30-day training
period. On the Skill Web. 3 dots separate Intelligence
and the Demolitions Skill, so the test target number is
10 (base Target Number 4 + default modifier of 6). The
test yields 2 successes, and so Phantom's final training
time is 15 days (30 days + 2).
TRAINING WITH AN INSTRUCTOR
Instructors can aid characters in two ways. First, they may
enable characters to learn new skills they cannot learn on their
own. Second, they can help reduce the training time required to
improve an existing skill or learn a new one.
Any qualified character can serve as an instructor, The student
character can try to convince a friend to teach him or her a skill.
enlist the aid of a contact, or seek out a professional Instructor.
Friends and contacts may accept favors in return for instruction,
but professional instructors usually demand nuyen for their services (see Instructor Fees, p. 52).
Instructor Qualifications
An instructor must possess two basic qualifications. First, the
instructor must know the skill the student wishes to learn. If the
student wants to improve a skill, the instructor must have a skill
rating that equals or exceeds the rating the student wishes to
achieve.
Second, the Instructor should possess the Instruction Skill
(see the Revised Skill Web. p. 47). An individual without the
Instruction Skill can attempt to teach a skill, but the would-be
instructor must possess a Skill Rating 3 or higher in the skill he or
she is teaching. When training a student who wants to improve a
skill, the instructor must possess a skill rating at least 2 levels
higher than the skill rating he or she is attempting to teach.
Teaching
When teaching a new skill or helping a character improve an
existing skill rating, an instructor makes an Instruction (4) Test. If
the instructor does not possess the Instruction Skill. he or she
makes a test using the skill being taught with a +4 target modifier. For every 2 successes that either test generates, add 1 to the
student's Skill Test success total, for purposes of reducing the student's required training time.
If the Instruction Test or Skill Test generates no successes, the
instructor simply cannot teach the student. To simulate this failure
in the game universe, the student must compensate the Instructor for his or her efforts by forfeiting 1 day's worth of pay to the
instructor, and must also add 1.5 days to his training time for the
skill-this represents the character's disappointment at failing
with one instructor and the need to shift gears to find another
teacher, not to mention the nuyen spent on the first instructor. The
gamemaster can use any number of reasons to explain the failure
in roleplaying terms-the Instructor and student may have philosophical differences, the instructor's methods may clash with the
material, or the two characters may distrust one another or simply
be incompatible.
Characters who are learning a new skill with the aid of an
instructor also receive a -1 target modifier on their Skill Tests for
learning new skills.
An instructor must train with the student for the student's
entire training time. If the instructor leaves before the student
has completed the training, double the remaining training time.
This Increase represents the greater difficulty of learning on
one's own.
Instructor Fees
Instructor fees present a convenient way for gamemasters to
curb characters that may threaten game balance by accumulating
massive skill sets. The Suggested Instructor Fees Table provides
suggested daily instructor fees, but gamemasters should modify
fees as they see fit. After all, better instructors will command higher fees than mediocre instructors, and instruction in rare or highly
prized skills will cost more than instruction in common skills.
Scarecrow wants to improve his Armed Combat
Skill Rating from 3 to 4. Armed Combat is a general
skill. so the increase costs 8 Karma Points, That
means the base training time is 56 days (8 x 7 = 56).
Scarecrow makes an Armed Combat (6) Test to
reduce the time and achieves 2 successes. That
brings the training time down to 28 days (56 + 2).
However, Scarecrow has arranged for Oak, a fellow
runner, to teach him Armed Combat. (Oak has Armed
Combat 6, so he's qualified to teach Scarecrow at Armed
Combat 4.) Oak achieves 2 successes on his Instruction
Test, so Scarecrow adds an extra success to his Armed
Combat Test result. That brings the training time down to
18 days (56+ 3).

Scarecrow is pretty happy-and so is Oak as he
calculates his fee. (Oak's not that good of a friend.
And besides, the streets are the streets-if you have
something of value, you need to cash in on it.)
Professional instructors with Instruction 4 usually
charge about 100 nuyen per day, so Oak figures his
services are worth 1.800 nuyen. (Teaching Armed

Oak knows Scarecrow doesn't have that kind of
cred. so he makes Scarecrow a deal. In lieu of the fee.
Scarecrow agrees to introduce Oak to Scarecrow's
contact, the one with all the cool advanced weaponry.
Oak figures a contact like that is worth a thousand or
so nuyen-plus, Scarecrow has agreed to buy him dinner every day this month.
Virtual Instructors
If a character cannot find a live instructor or does not want to
use one, he or she can purchase a "virtual instructor." Virtual
instructors may take the form of simsense chips, optical computer disks or trideo tapes.
As with living instructors, every virtual-instructor program
has an effective skill rating in the skill it teaches and an Instruction
Skill rating. The program cannot make an Instruction Test to
reduce the student's base training time, but all other standard
instructor rules apply. Perhaps the most important advantage a
virtual instructor offers is that a character can purchase a chip with
a very high skill rating and then use that same program when
training for multiple advanced ratings in a single skill.
To determine the cost of a virtual-instructor program, combine the program's effective skill rating and Instruction rating and
divide the sum by 2 (round up) for the average rating, then consult the Skill Memory Table (p. 248, SRII) to determine the Mp
size of the program. Calculate the cost in nuyen by multiplying the
program's Mp by 5.
To reflect the difficulty of obtaining virtual-instructor programs for skills that are inherently illegal or restricted (such as
Demolitions, Military Vehicle Skills, or high-level Firearms and
Weapons Skills), treat such programs as if they have Street
Indexes of 2 and Availability Ratings of 10.

Similarly, skill chips are not readily available for general skills
rated at 6 or higher, Concentrations of 7 or higher, and
Specializations of 8 or higher. Treat such skills as if they have
Availability Ratings of 10 or higher and Street Indexes of 1.5 (such
chips may not be illegal, but they are hard to acquire).
Wraith decides he wants to raise his Biology
(Zoology) Rating from 1 to 2. He goes to the local
Chips 'R' Us. He finds the best Zoology virtual-instructor program on the market; the gamemaster decides it
has an Instruction Rating 6. The chip contains enough
data to bring a character up to Zoology 3, so it has an
effective Skill Rating of 3.
The two ratings produce an average of 4.5.
rounded up to 5. The gamemaster then consults the
Skillsoft Memory Table. A Rating 5 General
Skill/Concentration chip contains 150 Mp, so the
training chip costs 750¥ (5 x 150). That's a pretty
good deal, because Wraith can re-use the chip later if
he wants to raise his Zoology Rating to 3, and he
won't have to spend more nuyen.
TRAINING DAYS
A standard training-time "day" is 4 hours. Thus, a training
time of 30 days equals 120 hours of study.
A character who is particularly eager to learn or improve a
skill can train for more than 4 hours a day, though no metahuman
can train 24 hours a day. A character's daily training limit equals
half of his or her Willpower (rounded up) + 4.
Characters can train beyond their daily training limit, but such
training may prove ineffective. A character who wants to train in
this manner must declare how many hours beyond his limit he
intends to train. To determine how many of these hours will pay off.
the character makes a Willpower (10) Test. The result is the number
of extra hours of effective practice the character can put in beyond
his or her daily training limit. No matter what the test result, the
character may not exceed his declared extra practice time.
To determine the number of days the character will need to
complete his training at the new pace, simply divide the total
number of hours in the training time by the character's total daily
training period.
Remember Scarecrow? He needed 18 days to
Improve his Firearms Skill (that comes out to 72
hours). Scarecrow is impatient, however, and he has
lots of time on his hands. Consequently, he decides
to spend 10 hours a day training. He has Willpower
6. so his maximum daily training limit is 7 hours (16
+ 2] + 4).
To determine how many of the extra 3 hours
will be effective, Scarecrow makes a Willpower (10)
Test. The test yields 1 success. That means each day's
training session will yield 8 hours of effective training
(even though Scarecrow slogs away for 10 hours).
However, the extended daily training sessions
reduce Scarecrow's training time to 9 days (72 + 8).
IMPROVING ATTRIBUTES
If desired, gamemasters may allow player characters to
improve their Attributes in the same manner they improve skills.
(For roleplaying purposes, the player character will need to devise
some way to "work out" using the Attribute. For example, a character might lift weights for several hours each day to improve his
or her Strength. In all cases, the gamemaster determines if a proposed training regimen is appropriate.)
The base training time to improve an Attribute is the same as
the base training time for an active (non-knowledge) skill (7 days
times the number of Karma Points required for the improvement).
See p. 190. SRII, for Karma costs of Attribute increases. To reduce
the training time, a player character can make an Attribute (6)
Test, using the Attribute he or she is improving.
Generally, player characters can raise their Attributes without
the help of instructors. However, gamemasters may require that
characters use an instructor if they want to raise an Attribute to its
racial maximum or beyond. Gamemasters may also require that
characters use instructors when increasing their Willpower.
Intelligence or Charisma Ratings.
Instructor rules and fees for Attribute training are generally
the same as for skill training. However, the instructor skill qualifications do not apply. Instead, the instructor must possess an
Instruction Skill Rating that exceeds the Attribute Rating the student wants to achieve. (The instructor's ability to motivate the student is much more important than his own skill during Attribute
training.)
Golden Eyes wants to raise her Charisma Rating
from 5 to 6. The increase costs 6 Karma Points, which
gives her a base training time of 42 days (6 x 7 - 42).
Golden Eyes is human, so her racial maximum for
Charisma is Rating 6. Because she's going for the
maximum, the gamemaster insists that she train with
an Instructor.
After a little asking around, Golden Eyes finds
Mizz Manners, a troll who "can take a ghoul and
make it Miss Universe." Mizz Manners puts Golden
Eyes on a regimen of hard-core socializing. Golden
Eyes spends her nights hopping between the hippest
gallery openings, the trendiest clubs and the most
exclusive parties. During her days, Golden Eye rigorously trains to polish her manners, speech and dress,
and reads up on sophisticated conversational topics.
To reduce the length of her training period,
Golden Eyes makes a Charisma (6) Test. The test
yields 2 successes. Meanwhile, Mizz Manners
achieves 2 successes on her Instruction (4) Test. She
can contribute 1 success to Golden Eye's Attribute
Test success total-which brings it up to 3. That
means Golden Eyes' training time drops to 14 days
(42 + 3).

U
ust about everyone on this board thinks he or she knows
everything there is to know about shad owrunning. You
take a job from Mr. Johnson, do your homework, go on
the run and get paid when you're finished (assuming you
live). You blow your hard-earned nuyen on some nifty
toys that extend your lifespan while shortening your
opposition's, and as you're buying them through your
fixer, you let her know you're available again. She puts
out feelers and sets up a meet when she finds something
promising. Repeat cycle until further notice.
It's true that shadowrunning tends to follow this pattern. So it's important to recognize the biggest link in this circular
chain-the Johnson. Without those shady characters to give runners an income and something to do at 02:38 on a Wednesday
night, the cycle stops. Joe Runner, desperate and credless, knocks
over a Stuffer Shack for groceries and "rent" money to pay the
local gangers. At 02:40 Joe Runner gets capped by the overly nervous clerk with the Mossberg behind the counter, or by a random
customer with Shiawase's May 2055 batch of wired flexes who
never paid attention to the recall, Joe-boy ends up cremated
and dumped into a nearby lake, to become an integral part of
the hard rain that eats away layers of paint on our cars and
homes.
Okay, maybe I'm going a bit overboard-but clearly. without
Mr. Johnsons there is no shadowrunning biz. Like it or not. we
depend on these people for our livelihoods. So, as the latest in a
long line of public services (for which I rarely get the thanks I
deserve). I offer this post-snagged by my ever-helpful friend JJas an example of the kind of drek to expect from the average
Johnson.
This E-pamphlet crawled out of the brain of William Ager.

America's New York office as Head Resources Adjuster (read:

every reason to see this inspiring piece of work as typical of
Johnsons in general, even though the details may differ from
Johnson to Johnson or corp to corp-so everybody read to the
end of the paragraph, 'kay? Stuff like this could save your hoop.
or at least get you an extra five percent in advance. And if you

WHY SHOULD I USE THE RAD?
The Resources Adjustment Department exists to provide outside personnel who can perform various specilized services for
our clients. Supplemental resources-"shadowrunners," to use
the vulgar term-are available through the RAD to accomplish
tasks that Fuchi America's official assets cannot perform because
of questionable legality. lack of departmental funds, insufficient
border clearance to enter other sovereign nations or corporate
nation-states, and other such inconveniences. Our goal is to provide you with non-Fuchi personnel who can assist you as needed
to help you maximize Fuchi America's profits with a minimum of
exposure or personal danger to yourself and other Fuchi employees

WHOM DO I HIRE?
Whenever you need outside help, the RAD makes hiring easy
for you! We search our databases for unofficial assets whose track
records most closely match your stated needs. The RAD then contacts these assets through intermediaries and informs them of your
job offer. Finally. RAD staffers arrange a suitable meeting time and
place. Then the RAD steps out of the picture unless directed otherwise. If you feel that attending the meeting in person constitutes an
unacceptable risk to your or your department's security, a RAD representative will attend the meeting in your stead.
0 This means that if the actual Johnson is afraid to meet because
he thinks somebody'Il geek him, they'll send one of their "officially unofficial" slots in lieu of the paranoid J. Or the Johnson thinks he
can't show his face because someone is tracking his movements,
so he uses the anonymous stooge to do his dirty work while he
camps out in his fancy doss. Or the Johnson can't make the meet
because he's indulging in a little "late-night account balancing"
with his secretary or the tea lady, but he needs the deal to go
down RIGHT FRAGGING NOW. Whatever the reason, keep in mind
that any J. hiring you may be one of these RAD people. If so, then
for fragging sure everything isn't os it seems.
Come to think of it, that's how it works most times (in my experience).

Sorry to disappoint you. Todd, but it's a straight-arrow doc. The
security clearance on this file is OME49-AA. The prefix OME stands
for "Omega," which is the highest-rated security level Fuchi uses
(that we know of) Anything with Omega clearance is kept on-site
in a closed system. It cannot be transferred to a system that doesn't have Omega status. If anyone attempts to do so, the internal
code destroys the file and tries to take down the non-Omega system (your cyberdeck). Omega systems have special circuitry
hardwired into all optical chips, datalines, etc. that integrate with
all files. So attempting to copy the RAD.doc file to a local system
will only result in much fuss and lost nuyen. Don't bother trying.

LONG-TERM SRs have proved their ability to work well for
Fuchi America in past assignments or excel in three or more
"focus categories" that the RAD looks for in prospective supplemental-resource employees. They are generally dependable, reasonably loyal to Fuchi as a source of steady income, and tend to
approach contract negotiations amiably. A long-term supplemental resource may only be used with the approval of this department's Head Resources Adjuster. As a matter of policy. Fuchi personnel who have recently gained access to the Resources
Adjustment Department are restricted to working with short-term
or expendable supplemental resources until the Head Resources
Adjuster deems the client experienced enough in working with
SRs to have developed the proper attitude toward them. On occasion, long-term SRs may be assigned indefinitely to a single client.
0 We have our word for these wastes of air-"sell-outs."
0 Yegah@nowhere.com
SHORT-TERM SRs, the most numerous category, have shown
a certain indifference to Fuchi America's interests in past assignments (short of an outright breach of contract) or are new to working for Fuchi America. In either case, they are considered possible
security breaches and must be watched closely for any sign of disloyalty. A short-term SR who demonstrates willingness to work at
a high professional standard for Fuchi America will be evaluated
by RAD staffers and may be raised to long-term status. As longterm assignments pay considerably more than short-term assignments, many new short-termers are strongly motivated to perform well on the job.

WHAT SHOULD I EXPECT?
Regarding the initial meeting with your designated SRs. the
RAD strongly recommends following certain procedures. Most
clients will deal with short-term SRs, who are not known for treating potential employers with respect. To compensate for this treatment, the RAD offers the following guidelines for business success:
TREAT THE SRS AS HOSTILE. Even if they appear wholesome
(a statistically improbable occurrence), assume that they are willing to kill you for any trivial reason should the opportunity present
itself. These people are hardened criminals who commit heinous
crimes for nuyen. They are mercenaries, living merely for the next
payment, and they will try to squeeze you for all they can get.
Remember that every nuyen you pay them is one less nuyen for
Fuchi America. They are tools, no more: your job is to get as much
work out of them as possible while compensating them as little as
possible.
No matter how well they may present themselves, these are
not honorable, decent people. As criminals, they have no claim to
fair treatment or respect. Treat them like the beasts they are: toss
them their dinner from a safe distance and make sure that Fuchi
America does not get bitten. If you think of them as being "just
like us" even for a moment. you have already failed.
0 The Ager paranoia surfaces again. Nice to see some things
never change!
· Makkanagee
0 Of course, we won't say a word about the honor or decency of
the fine folks who hire us "hardened criminals" to "commit heinous
crimes for nuyen."

ØLark
0 Come on. They're not all this dreadful. I've worked with a
Johnson or two who was pretty much on the level, and who

didn't look at me like she smelled something bad. This Ager slot is
just feeding into a stereotype.
La Marquise
Every stereotype has a grain of truth in it. Marq-that's why they
endure. I agree, Ager's a little over-the-top, but the same general
attitude is more common than not among Johnsons in my experience. Get as much as you can for as little as you can, and remember the street grunts are expendable. Ager's just being a little
more blatantly venomous about it. Given his history. I'm not surprised.
· Miz Liz
. As to getting a lot for a little, are most of us any different?
· StreetWyze
CONCEAL YOUR IDENTITY. If the SRs recognize you or your
affiliation, they may attempt to blackmail you at a later date. Such
a development would be harmful to you and to Fuchi America.
Departmental research indicates that SRs are prone to make snap
judgements about clients based on observations they make at the
initial meeting. The RAD therefore supplies "plainclothes" for
these meetings-generic suits of a conservative cut that cannot be
easily identified as contemporary corporate fashion.
If the situation calls for a greater degree of misdirection, RAD
staffers can suggest various ensembles and accoutrements that
incorprate the hallmarks of other corporations or organizations,
Cosmetic changes can also be made at a client's request, including wigs, contact lenses, melanin pills to change skin tone, and so
on. Using these, a client may conceal his own identity or temporarily adopt someone else's.

Do they got pointy-ear kits an' fake horns, too?
Lark
NEVER OFFER MORE THAN 80 PERCENT OF THE PAYMENT INITIALLY. These people Invariably attempt to negotiate higher fees,
sometimes even presuming to double your opening bid. If you offer
80 percent or less of the approved payment to begin with, you can
"bargain" with them up to the total sum authorized, leaving them
convinced that they have "won" without cutting any deeper into
Fuchi America's profits than your superiors have deemed acceptable.
Beginning your bid below the 80-percent threshold may even allow
you to pay the SRs less than the maximum authorized amount. Fuchi
America appreciates such efforts to save the corporation nuyen, and
is likely to reward the conscientious employee accordingly.
On those occasions when it is not possible to hold the SRs to
the approved payment, a certain "overhead" is authorized-generally 20-25 percent of the approved payment. When bargained
down within this overhead. the SRs will believe they are receiving
150 percent of the initial offer. which should be sufficient to satisfy even the greediest of these criminals. DO NOT UNDER ANY
CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEED THIS 25 PERCENT OVERHEAD. There
are always more SRs than there are assignments available, and
Fuchi America's profits must always be the prime consideration. If
the asking price of any given group of SRs exceeds the overhead,
walk away from the meeting. Notify the RAD, and our staffers will
contact another group of SRs ASAP.

HOW CAN I GUARANTEE SUCCESS?
Strictly speaking, you cannot guarantee success. You can.
however, maximize the opportunity for success to occur by following the guidelines we've put together and keeping a few facts
in mind. First of all, no SR can be fully trusted. Even long-term SRs
with excellent track records are not Fuchi employees, and should
not be afforded the trust given to members of the Fuchi
Community™.

Statistically, 98 percent of all short-term SRs have satisfactorily
completed their assignments for our clients. The RAD has achieved
this excellent success rate with our Keep An Eye Out surveillance
program, founded in 2037 to prevent breaches of contract. (This
program should not be confused with the Put An Eye Out campaign, established in 2054 to combat unauthorized trid broadcasts
from Fuchi facilities by non-Fuchi employees.) The KAEO program
uses sophisticated surveillance gear and techniques to keep track of
SR teams, including (but not limited to) the following:
Credsticks with Active On Demand™ locator bugs. When the
credstick logs a transaction, the signal activates a trace program
that heads for the nearest Fuchi domain. The trace program lets
KAEO personnel instantly ascertain the whereabouts of any SR
using an AOD credstick.
High-altitude surveillance drones. Most frequently used in
conjunction with AOD credsticks, the drones acquire their targets
at the initial meeting. The credsticks serve as target beacons for
the drones, allowing them to patch Into the Global Positioning
System and track the movements of the SRs within 1.25 meters.
Watcher spirits. These spirits report any and all unusual activity of an SR directly to RAD mages. If weather permits (and the situation calls for it). RAD mages may also dispatch storm spirits to
remind recalcitrant SRs where their interests lie.
Bill Ager-Master of the Euphemism.
® WyrdNyrd

Tissue samples for use as material links. Tissue samples are
more useful as a psychological than a physical threat; Fuchi
America does not have the time, manpower, or inclination to
employ full-fledged ritual sorcery to track down every SR who
breaks a contract. Extreme cases, however, warrant extreme
responses, and Fuchi America will not hesitate to mete out the
appropriate punishment when necessary. For most SRs, the simple threat of such punishment suffices to keep them in line.
Observation of the companions and relatives of SRs. If necessary, the RAD will use strong-arm tactics upon these close associates to ensure adequate job performance on the part of the SRs.
As a matter of policy, Fuchi prefers not to resort to such measures
unless absolutely necessary, as they frequently elicit a counterproductive level of resentment in those SRs subjected to them, In
most such cases, the RAD must make arrangements for the SRs'
termination at the end of the assignment.

I'll type slowly so you can understand. Fuchi Exec A and Fuchi
Exec B are both up for promotion. Fuchi Exec A has slightly better
standing, so he looks like the winner. So Fuchi Exec B hires
Shadowrunning Team C to break into Fuchi Exec A's doss and
"steal" compromising balance sheets that "prove" Fuchi Exec A
has been skimming from the company. Fuchi Exec B makes the
tradeoff with Team C on the property of a Fuchi subsidiary, and as
they're leaving he informs Fuchi Corp Strike Team D that site security's been breached. Fuchi Corp Strike Team D blows the drek out
of Shadowrunning Team C, leaving crispy chunks with which to
feed Security Paranimal E. Endgame: Fuchi Exec B is a hero for
exposing Exec A's perfidy, and for preventing a serious on-site
security breach. Exec A gets canned, most likely followed by a
bullet to the back of the head. The runners who could crack the
whole thing open if they put two and two together are safely fried.
Exec B gets his promotion and sits pretty, even though he's cost
Fuchi a valuable fellow employee. To make sure his little scheme
comes off, of course, he's most likely going to subtly frag up the

ontacts and Enemies are non-player characters (NPCs) that gamemasters can use to make Shadowrun
games richer, more unpredictable and more exciting for players.
The following section offers new contacts rules that gamemasters and players can use to expand the
use of contacts In their games, as well as rules for creating and using Enemies-NPCs that hold grudges,
personal and otherwise, against player characters.
MAXIMIZING CONTACTS
Contacts are often the best, and occasionally the only way a runner can find out just what kind of drek
he's gotten into. Furthermore, gamemasters can use contacts to make the Shadowrun world a fuller,
more colorful place to play. Despite those advantages, many Shadowrun groups don't exploit the full
potential of contacts. Too many gamemasters don't take the time to flesh out their players' contacts, and
too many players never even consider exploring the roleplaying opportunities contacts provide. Character Interactions with contacts remain nothing more than Etiquette Tests and the expenditure of a few nuyen.
Making contacts into fully realized characters-"fleshing them out," in other words-is the key to getting the
most from contacts. To achieve this, gamemasters must spend a little time creating a background for each of their
players' contacts.
Deciding what a contact does when he's not providing information to curious runners is a good place to
start. Giving each contact a few Edges or Flaws from the Character Creation section (p. 21) or giving a contact
a catch-phrase archetype title-such as Former Wage Slave. Company Man, Street Doc, Combat Mage,
Mercenary, Detective, or Bodyguard-can help make the contact a distinct personality, With a little more effort,
a contact can become a unique person. Obviously, Joe the Bartender contact spends his evenings tending bar,
but what does he do in his spare time? Maybe he's an avid Urban Brawl fan and he's always got a game on the
trid when a runner calls. Maybe he's having trouble with his wife or his business isn't going too well. Maybe his

daughter is getting mixed up in the wrong kind of crowd-gangs.
BTLs and the like. All of these things will affect how Joe reacts to
a runner's inquiries and might even serve as a springboard for a
shadowrun. A contact might also turn the tables and ask a runner
for a favor. Find a way to make it clear that contacts have lives of
their own. They don't just sit around and wait for runners to call.
CONTACT LEVELS
The basic Shadowrun rules classify contacts into three
groups-standard "contacts," "buddies" and "followers." These
classifications provide a way to broadly reflect the relationship
between a runner and a contact. Unfortunately, these classifications do not always provide an adequate reflection of runner/contact relationships. A contact may be an old friend, but according
to the standard rules, a poor result on an Etiquette Test may keep
that old friend from revealing what he or she knows.
The following contact levels are designed to address this shortcoming by better reflecting the relationships between runners and
contacts. Each level provides a runner with distinct advantages and
disadvantages when dealing with his contact. The "upkeep" figure
represents the amount of nuyen a runner must spend maintaining
the contact each year (see Contact Upkeep, below).
LEVEL 1 CONTACT
The Level 1 contact is basically the standard Shadowrun contact (p. 43, SRII). Level 1 contacts function like real-life "acquaintances." A Level 1 contact may know information that a character
needs and will probably reveal it-but he may keep it to himself
just because he doesn't feel any particular loyalty to the character.
On the other hand, a Level 1 contact is less likely to remember a runner's identity or even existence when the "bad guys"
come a-callin'. And if the contact does remember the runner, he
is very unlikely to have any idea where the runner can be found.
Advantages: The gamemaster may make an opposed
Intelligence (6) Test for the contact to determine if the contact can
recall information about the runner when asked. The gamemaster
may modify the target number as he sees fit.
Upkeep: 500 nuyen
LEVEL 2 CONTACT
A Level 2 contact knows the runner and sees him on a semiregular basis. The runner and contact have developed a certain
level of trust, and the contact will remain loyal as long as he does
not have to stick his neck out too far on the runner's behalf. A
Level 2 contact will always provide the information a runner is
looking for and may even "keep his ear to the ground" for a runner if he has the time.
Level 2 contacts are considered "buddies" for purposes of
character creation.
Advantages: A runner receives 1 extra die for any Etiquette
Tests made to acquire information from Level 2 contacts. In addition, the gamemaster may make an opposed Willpower (5) Test
for the contact to determine if the contact can successfully refuse
to answer questions about the runner.
Upkeep: 3,000 nuyen
LEVEL 3 CONTACT
A Level 3 contact is more than a buddy-she's a friend for
life. A runner may have grown up with her Level 3 contact in the
Seattle sprawl, or the runner may have pulled the contact's nearly fried hoop out of a Lone Star fire fight. A Level 3 contact knows
the runner well and interacts with him or her on a regular basis.
The character may not even think of his or her friend as a contact,
but what that person does or knows will surely be useful to the
runner at some point.
Advantages: A runner receives 2 extra dice for Etiquette
Tests made to acquire information from his or her Level 3 contacts. In addition, the gamemaster may make an opposed
Willpower (6) Test for the contact to determine if the contact can
successfully refuse to answer questions about the runner.
Upkeep: 7.000 nuyen
CONTACT CREATION COST
Under the standard Shadowrun rules, every player can
choose 2 free contacts for his or her character during character
creation. These free contacts are considered Level 1 contacts, as
are all other contacts purchased during character creation (see p.
46. SRII). All "buddies" obtained during character creation are
considered Level 2 contacts. ("Followers," including tribe and
gang members, are not considered contacts.)
As stated in the rules, player characters may not purchase contacts after character creation. Any contacts gained during the course
of a game or campaign must be acquired through roleplaying.
Individual gamemasters and players should determine the details of
meeting contacts in this manner. As a rule of thumb, however, new
contacts should be Level 1 contacts. Only rarely should circumstances permit characters to gain new contacts at Level 2. Under no
circumstances should new contacts start as Level 3 contacts.
Players must pay the appropriate upkeep costs for all contacts gained during character creation from their starting nuyen.
For example, a player who wishes to raise a free Level 1 contact
to a Level 3 contact must pay a total of 10,000 nuyen (combined
Level 2 and Level 3 upkeep costs = 10,000).
CONTACT UPKEEP
Contacts are people too, and characters must treat them as
such. Contacts are not simply handy sources of information that
can be ignored until the character needs to learn the identity of
the new sales VP at the Big Pyramid or the latest scuttlebutt at the
local Lone Star station. If a character treats her contact as nothing
more than a convenient reference to be consulted like a book, that
contact will eventually become disillusioned and uncooperative.
Keeping a contact happy is known as "contact upkeep."
Contact upkeep is a two-part process, Part 1 consists of roleplaying. The gamemaster decides what constitutes adequate contact
upkeep in terms of a player's portrayal of his or her character's
rapport with, concern for and relationship to a contact. Generally.
characters simply need to treat their contacts with the respect
they deserve in order to maintain them. Characters need not
shower their contacts with gifts or visit them every day of the
week. But they should treat the contact to a soykaf every once in
a while or slide him a loan when he needs one.

Part 2 consists of spending the required annual upkeep cost
to maintain the contact. Characters can pay a contact's required
upkeep cost over the course of a game year. Characters can use
upkeep nuyen to buy their contacts drinks or dinner, do the occasional favor, or simply give the contact an occasional credstick.
Basically, anything that's worth hard nuyen can be considered part
of the upkeep payment for a contact. For example, the value of
letting your buddy know that he should sell his Ares stock
because you expect it to take a major dive now that the corp's hot
new drone prototype happens to be sitting in your bedroom closet may be equal to an entire year's upkeep cost. Gamemasters
determine the value of such favors, advice, services and so on.
A contact's level drops if a character fails to spend the
required upkeep nuyen on him, or if the gamemaster determines
that the character has failed to adequately maintain the contact
with roleplaying. Gamemasters should feel free to create additional, unique requirements for maintaining contacts in their campaigns.
If a Level 2 or Level 3 contact drops a level, a character can
regain the contact's previous level by using the rules in Improving
Contact Levels.
A gamemaster has at least three options when a character
fails to maintain a Level I contact, and may use any one or all
three options at his discretion. The character may simply never
hear from the contact again; in that case, the character cannot use
the contact or any of the contact's contacts for information (see
Friends of a Friend, below). The contact can become the character's Enemy (see p. 71). The character may also earn him- or herself the Bad Reputation Flaw (see p. 31).
If a character loses all his or her contacts by failing to fulfill
upkeep requirements, the character receives the Flaws Hung Out
to Dry and Bad Reputation (pp. 32, 31). Increase by I the Priority
levels of all the character's Enemies as well (see Enemies, p. 71).
Billy Boy, just your average mercenary looking
to make a name for himself, starts the game with 2
contacts. Joe is the bartender down at Droogies,
where Billy Boy likes to spend his extra nuyen.
Timmons is a Lone Star beat cop, who's actually a
Level 2 buddy. (Billy Boy once dated Timmons's sister. Billy Boy and Timmons got along real well, and
remained friends even after Billy Boy and the sister
broke up.)
Billy Boy spends plenty of time and nuyen at
Droogies, and he tips well. Consequently, the
gamemaster decides that Billy doesn't have to spend
additional nuyen or go out of his way to maintain Joe
as a Level 1 contact.
Timmons, however, is a Level 2 contact, so Billy
has to make more of an effort to maintain him.
Besides taking Timmons out on the town and buying
his drinks on a semi-regular basis, Billy tips him off to
small-time criminals like the "no-good ganger kids"
who harass the elderly and occasionally rob the
mom-and-pop diners where Billy Boy gets his cheap
eats. When Billy's gamemaster decides these things
may not be enough to maintain a Level 2 contact,
Billy decides to fix up Timmons with a nice chica he
knows down Tacoma way. The gamemaster thinks
this is a creative idea and decides that as long as
Timmons and the girl continue to see each other.
Billy need only spend half the usual upkeep cost buying drinks for Timmons.
IMPROVING CONTACT LEVELS
To improve a contact's level during the course of play, a character must pay the upkeep cost of the contact's current level, as
well as the cost of the contact's new level. For example, a character who wants to raise his Level 2 buddy to a Level 3 contact must
pay a total of 10,000 nuyen (Level 2 cost of 3,000 + Level 3 cost
of 7,000). The character then must also pay the standard upkeep
cost to maintain the contact.
Alternatively, gamemasters may allow characters to improve
the level of their contacts by spending Karma. When using this
option, the character must spend a number of Karma Points equal
to twice the new level. For example, a character using Karma to
improve a Level 1 contact to a Level 2 contact would have to
spend 4 Karma Points. Improving a contact to Level 3 would cost
6 Karma Points. Contacts cannot be improved more than 1 level
in this manner. The character then must also pay the standard
upkeep cost to maintain the contact.
Gamemasters must approve all contact level improvements,
based on the fictional relationship between character and contact.
A contact who only occasionally sees a character and who does
not have a particularly friendly relationship with that character is
not an appropriate choice for a Level 3 contact.
FRIENDS OF A FRIEND
Because contacts have lives of their own, they have contacts
of their own as well. These secondary contacts, one step removed
from the characters, are known as Friends of a Friend (FOFs). Thus,
Billy Boy from the preceding example not only has access to any
help Joe and Timmons can give him, he also has access to the
people that joe and Timmons know. These people are Billy's FOFs.
FOFs provide more options to characters, more color and
background to games, and more realism. For example, Joe the
bartender wouldn't realistically have a stockpile of Ares' finest
weapons organized next to the synth-alcohol on the shelf.
However, he could very plausibly know a guy who has a warehouse full of such goodies.
Generally, every character contact starts the game with a
Level 1. a Level 2 and a Level 3 contact. Fixers and Mr. Johnson
contacts are exceptions to this rule-because of the line of work
they pursue, these contacts know 2 other contacts at each level.
Gamemasters may adjust these numbers to fit their campaigns (see Special Contacts, p. 66), though giving non-fixer and
non-Johnson primary contacts more than 3 secondary contacts
might make it too easy for player characters to acquire both
equipment and information. On the other hand, allowing primary
contacts to know a greater variety of secondary contacts can provide a needed jump-start to a campaign that may have gotten

bogged down or reached a dead end.
Additionally, because FOFs come from "outside" the characters' sphere of knowledge.
gamemasters can use FOFs to generate
adventures outside the expected parameters
of a campaign.
USING FOFS
To acquire information, equipment or
other help from FOFs, characters must make
the first
the appropriate tests. Any bonus dice a character receives for making tests in interactions
with his contact apply when the character
interacts with the contact's FOFs as well. Test target modifiers
appear in the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table, These modifiers
represent a FOF's willingness to help a character-a FOF who's a
mere acquaintance of a character's contact won't be as ready to
help a relative stranger as will a contact's good friend.
Like all contacts, FOFs expect a little nuyen in exchange for
their help. To calculate the fee a FOF expects, first determine the
basic contact fee (see p. 202, SRII), then multiply the basic fee by
the appropriate cost/time multiplier from the Friend of a Friend
Modifiers Table, Gamemasters may choose to increase the cost
modifier if the character has to go through multiple FOFs to get
what he wants. At the gamemaster's discretion, a Level 3 FOF
may reduce or even waive his fee as a favor to the contact.
The cost/time multiplier is also used to calculate the time a
character must wait for a FOF to deliver information or goods (see
Waiting for the Goods, p. 65). The Wrong Party modifiers are
used when making Wrong Party Tests (see The Walls Have Ears,
p. 65).
Billy Boy's had a run of good luck lately and has
some nuyen in his pocket, so he decides to pick up a
less-than-legal Ares Alpha Combatgun with the
optional grenade launcher. Billy starts out by making
a standard Etiquette Test with Joe the bartender. The
test generates only 1 success, so Joe gives Billy an
odd look and says he "might know someone."(The
gamemaster has decided that Joe's 3 secondary contacts are a Mafia foot soldier (Level 1), a decker
whom Joe's known for years (Level 2), and Joe's
brother (Level 3), who's a bouncer at a swanky
downtown club.)
Billy approaches Timmons, his Lone Star officer
contact. He uses the bonus dice for his Etiquette Test
and generates 5 successes. Consequently, Timmons
is more than willing to help Billy. He tells Billy he'd
be happy to introduce him to any of his own secondary contacts-a Renraku security officer (Level 1),
a former Lone Star employee who now operates his
own private sec firm (Level 2), and a reformed fixer
who happens to have been Timmons's first arrest
(Level 3).

Billy decides that joe's mob foot-soldier friend

back after midnight and he'll introduce him to Tony
the Snake. When Billy returns, Joe directs him to a
private booth, where Tony's waiting. At this point,
Billy Boy makes his Etiquette Test. The standard base

can't help him. Tony says he deals only in olive oil.
not guns.
Billy then turns to Timmons's ex-fixer friend.
Sexy Sioux. Sioux is a Level 3 contact of Timmons, so
Billy makes his Etiquette Test against a Target
Number 6. (Billy adds | extra die for the test,
because Timmons is a Level 2 contact.)
The test generates 2 successes, and Sioux says
she knows someone who can help Billy get his new
toy. Instead of a cash fee, though, Sioux wants a favor
from Billy. She needs some runners to help with a hit
on a Humanis Policlub training camp, and she wants
Billy to help. Billy Boy accepts the offer-he figures it'll
give him a chance to field test his new gun.
If Billy rejects Sioux's offer, he must pay her a
fee for her help, which the gamemaster calculates
according to the following formula. Sioux's a fixer
with Etiquette 5, Charisma 3, and Intelligence 5.
Using the basic contact fee formula, the gamemaster
calculates the basic fee at 800 nuyen:
Contact's Etiquette Skill Rating x Number of successes on character's Etiquette Test
x (Contact's Charisma + Intelligence) × 10 = basic
contact fee
5 x 2 x (5 + 3) × 10 = 800
Because Sioux is a Level 3 contact for Timmons,
the gamemaster decides what she'll charge Billy Boy.
As it turns out. she's willing to help out her friend's
friend. Sioux can reasonably be expected to charge

Billy Boy any amount from nothing ("Hey-I don't
charge nuyen to help my buddy Timmons' friends.")
to her usual fee of 800 nuyen ("I like your looks, so
I'm giving you my services at cost today."). Billy will
have to pay the cost of the gun, regardless of Sioux's
fee. If appropriate, Billy can make a standard
Negotiation Test to lower Sioux's fee.
WAITING FOR THE GOODS
To calculate the time a FOF needs to locate information or
equipment for a character, the gamemaster rolls 2D6, then applies
the appropriate cost/time multiplier from the Friend of a Friend
Multipliers Table to the result. The final result is the waiting period in days.
Characters may reduce the waiting period by spending any
number of their Etiquette Test successes or by paying the contact
additional money. For each success or for each additional 10 percent of the contact's fee the character chooses to pay, the period
is reduced by 1 day.
Note that this waiting period only reflects the time that a FOF
needs to track down the requested information and/or goods. The
gamemaster should also apply all standard Availability rules.
Billy Boy now knows his new Ares Alpha
Combatgun is on the way, and he wants to know
how long he'll have to wait. The gamemaster rolls
2D6 and gets a result of 7. Because Sioux's a Level 3
FOF, the gamemaster determines her cost/time multiplier. That means Billy may have to wait 7 days, or
he may get the gun immediately.
Sioux tells Billy Boy she can have the gun for him
in a few hours if he agrees to hit the Humanis camp. If
he refuses to help with the hit, Sioux says she'll need
7 days to locate and obtain the Ares Alpha.
Billy can't help with the Humanis hit, but he
doesn't want to wait 7 days for his gun, either. He
decides to slip Sioux some extra nuyen to speed
things along. Ten percent of Sioux's 800-nuyen fee is
80 nuyen; Billy decides he can afford to pay some
extra nuyen if it means getting his new toy faster, and
so he pays Sioux an extra 400 nuyen (80¥ x 50 percent) and cuts 5 days from the waiting period.
THE WALLS HAVE EARS
Any time a character discusses biz with a contact or FOFwhether it's a personal buddy or a FOF who agrees to meet the
character at the docks in the middle of a rainstorm at 4 a.m .other parties may hear about the character's interest in information, equipment or any other commodity potentially worth nuyen.
These other parties-appropriately designated "wrong parties"can be any individuals, groups or organizations that might feel
threatened by the character's inquiries, have an interest in grabbing a piece of the character's action, or simply dislike the character enough to mess with his or her plans.
To reflect the chances of wrong parties learning of a character's
Inquiries, the gamemaster makes a Wrong Party Test every time a
character uses a contact or FOF. The number of dice for the test
equals the number of individuals involved in the inquiry. For example, if a character talks biz to one contact, the gamemaster uses 2D6
for the test. If the inquiry is made by an 8-man team speaking to a
contact who must enlist the help of another contact, the gamemaster uses 10 dice. (The more people involved in an inquiry, the
greater the chance that someone. somewhere will slip up.)
The base target number for the Wrong Party Test is 6, but
gamemasters may increase it for especially careful or paranoid
characters, or decrease it for particularly careless characters.
If a Wrong Party Test generates successes, the gamemaster
determines the consequences based on the suggestions provided
in the Wrong Party Table (p. 66). All successes are cumulativeadd together the successes of all Wrong Party Tests made during
a single line of inquiry.
When characters use FOFs, apply the appropriate Wrong
Party modifier from the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table (note
that these are negative modifiers-they reduce the target number.
making it more likely that word will leak out). The number of dice
for the test equals the number of individuals involved in the
inquiry-all characters, FOFs, and the contacts who introduced the
characters and FOFs.
If a character asks a contact to "ask around" about a particular subject (see p. 202, SRII), add the appropriate modifier from
the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table.
Individual gamemasters determine the exact consequences
of Wrong Party Test successes, based on the campaign, the nature
of the character's inquiries, and the nature of the wrong party.
For example, Ares is accustomed to runners trying to steal its
latest weapons prototypes, so it might not act until a line of
inquiry generates 10 or more Wrong Party Test successes. On the
other hand, even 2 or 3 successes might prompt a paranoid paramilitary policlub group to go code red.
If several successes are generated during first-stage inquiries,
a gamemaster may decide that the wrong party begins a disinformation operation that sends the characters wrong or planted
information via their contacts and FOFs.
The Ares Alpha Combatgun is a new, highly illegal weapon. In fact, only Ares possesses the gun.
Even the manufacturer's corporate and military
clients are waiting for it.
Consequently, Billy Boy's attempts to obtain a
Combatgun are potentially a sensitive matter, so the
gamemaster makes Wrong Party Tests to determine
If Ares takes notice and action.
Billy's first level of inquiries consists of his meetings with joe the bartender and Timmons the cop. For
each of these meetings, the gamemasters uses 2D6
to make a Wrong Party (6) Test. The test for the meet
with Joe generates no successes. The test for
Timmons yields 1 success. Billy's not the first runner
to try to acquire a secret Ares weapon, and he probWRONG PARTY TABLE

Word has hit the street that you or your team is on a job. Your enemies prick up their ears, hoping to hear
something they can use against you. Other runners start watching you, looking for the chance to horn in
on your action. Corporate flunkies at all levels talk to their contacts, trying to pinpoint your target.

Somebody used the wrong words to the wrong people, and now the street knows what you're up to. Your
competition, your enemies and every potential target has a theory about your biz, but no one knows the

It was inevitable-only under the rarest circumstances can you plan, execute, and get paid for a job without some outside party somehow jeopardizing the run. Your competition is workin' the other side of the

your target is 99 percent confident that you're coming for them. Fortunately, you're professionals-you
knew this would happen, and you've got a plan to cover all the bases.

You're running a disinformation campaign of epic proportions, but it seems that the only detail that hasn't

that Plan B will get you in and out with a minimum of bloodshed. And you already know your next piece

sure to throw at you).
ably won't be the last. Consequently, Ares doesn't
even note his inquiry.
Billy' second level of inquiries consists of his
meetings with Tony the Snake and Sexy Sioux. For
the meeting with Tony, the gamemaster rolls 3D6 (1
die for Billy. I for Tony and | for Joe the bartender).
Tony is a Level 2 FOF. so the base Target Number 6
receives a -2 Wrong Party Modifier, as noted on the
Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table.
For the meeting with Sioux, the gamemaster
again uses 3D6 (1 die for Billy, 1 for Sioux and I for
Timmons the cop). The test receives no wrong party
modifier (Sioux is a Level 3 FOF), so the Target
Number is 6.
The test for the meet with Tony generates 1 success; the test for the meet with Sioux also generates
1. That produces a total of 3 successes for both levels of inquiry. That's still a relatively low level of successes, and Ares is a big corporation, so the
gamemaster decides that Ares still takes no notice of
Billy Boy's inquiries.
SPECIAL CONTACTS
Special contacts provide characters with access to greater
resources than standard contacts. Special contacts fall into four
categories: members of clubs and organizations, fixers, International contacts and Shadowland.
MEMBERS OF CLUBS AND ORGANIZATIONS
By acquiring a contact who is a member of a club or organization such as the Humanis Policlub, Ork Rights Committee or
other metahuman-rights groups, a character can gain FOFs who
may be able to provide inside information about the group's
activities or members.
Nearly any contact can be a member of a club or organization.
Clubs and organizations that espouse causes with broad appeal
are especially likely to Include a wide range of members. Wide
appeal, however, also means that the chances of a contact knowing anyone in the group privy to the real secrets are slim,
To determine the number of group members a character must
wade through to get inside information, the gamemaster rolls ZD6
and divides the result by 2 (rounding up). The final result equals the
number of people the character must talk to before reaching a
knowledgeable FOF. Consider each FOF to be a contact of the previous FOF. and apply all appropriate cost/time multipliers and
wrong party modifiers from the Friend of a Friend Modifiers Table.
FIXERS
The fixer is a combination pawn shop, Hollywood agent,
politician, arms dealer, drug smuggler, underworld crime boss,
con man, used-car salesman, and, in rare cases, normal person, all
rolled into one. The fixer knows a wide range of individuals of
diverse talents, and he makes his money using these contacts to
supply a client with whatever the client needs or wants-for a fee,
of course. To reflect this, all fixers possess 6 secondary contacts,
usually including another fixer and, occasionally, a Mr. Johnson.

While many fixers maintain their edge by serving as Jacks-ofall-trades, some fixers specialize in a particular field-such as supplying high-tech goods and services, magical goods and services,
or corporate connections. A specialist fixer's secondary contacts
should reflect his specialty. For example a magical middleman
might know a talismonger, a former wage mage, a magical
research specialist at Aztechnology, a member of the Illuminates
of the New Dawn, a street shaman and so on. (Gamemasters
should determine the fields of specialized fixers based on their
campaign needs.)
Basically, fixers earn their livelihoods by "doing favors" for
clients. Therefore, most prefer to maintain only "professional"
relationships with their runner contacts rather than developing
personal ones-it just makes matters far less complicated in the
long run. And they almost never provide information or services
for free. Typically, fixers demand payment in nuyen or a return
favor down the road.
INTERNATIONAL CONTACTS
An employee of a multinational megacorporation, a member
of a multinational organized-crime or political group, a soldier formerly stationed overseas-these are just a few examples of individuals who may serve as international contacts.
In addition to receiving information and/or assistance directly
from an international contact, a character can solicit help from FOFs
gained through that contact. To determine the number of people
the character must talk to before reaching a knowledgeable and
helpful FOF. the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and divides the result by 2
(rounding up). Consider each FOF to be a contact of the previous
FOF, and apply all appropriate cost/time multipliers and wrong
party modifiers from the Friend of a
Friend Modifiers Table.
Any time contacts meet international FOFs, gamemasters can
apply appropriate modifiers from the
International Contacts Table to the
FOF Etiquette (4) Test.
As always, money opens more
doors than anything else in
Shadowrun (see Using FOFs, p. 64).
For each additional 10 percent of
the total fee the character pays.
decrease the target numbers for
tests with the contact or FOF by I (to
a minimum of 2).
Players can also acquire foreign contacts by purchasing the
Friends Abroad Edge during character creation.
SHADOWLAND
The organization/information service/clearing-house
known
as
Shadowland may well be a shadowrunner's most useful "contact." In
addition to providing a valuable bulletin-board service and a secure, reliable line into the matrix,
Shadowland is host to the Hacker House (see Virtual Realities 2.0)
and serves as a link to numerous "private chat rooms" and other
specialty boards. Characters must remember, however, that nothing
in Shadowland is private. Unlike metahuman contacts, who may
agree to keep a secret and then actually keep their word, once a
piece of Information appears on Shadowland, it instantly becomes
available for public access. A character can hide the plans for a revolutionary new laser technology in Shadowland, but anyone else
who finds it can take it. Shadowland is strictly an "all or nothing"
proposition.
Any character with Computer 1 or higher may select
Shadowland as a contact during character creation. Shadowland is
a Level I contact, and characters may not improve its contact
level. The upkeep cost for Shadowland consists of the time and
effort required to learn and maintain the elaborate codes, and the
Matrix fees shadowrunners must pay to use this service. As part
of their upkeep requirements, characters must also periodically
post information to the Shadowland boards and to its databases.
Any communication in search of information conducted between
a character and another individual on Shadowland may be considered a FOF meeting, regardless of form (e-mail, icon-based
interaction and so on).
When dealing with Shadowland as a contact, the character
must do the work needed to find information: unlike other contacts, getting information from Shadowland is not a simple matter of asking a question, paying some nuyen and getting an
answer. Think of Shadowland as a combination dorm room and
massive private library-a somewhat messy room filled with personalized icons scattered about in a random fashion. All the real-2
More than I year to arrange travel

ly good stuff is there, but characters have to wade through a
bunch of really weird stuff to get to it. The person who created
each icon determines the appearance of each file-ranging from
the frighteningly realistic Dunkelzahn icon that represents his last
will and testament to the "standard" default Matrix Icon of a document stolen from Ares.
Characters must know the right codes and pass several ID
checks in order to gain access to Shadowland and to the desired
information. Like all contacts, Shadowland protects itself with a
well-established security screen. Rather than relying on systems
created and manufactured by outside sources. however,
Shadowland relies on the skills and talents of some of the best living deckers and programmers to manage its security. As a concession to the users' safety, characters are identified only by their
street name and decker icons-which do not indicate the location
of the character's meat body or the motivation of his data search.
Any information search in Shadowland takes 3D6 days to
perform from a tortoise deck. This period reflects the time
required to go through the millions of datapulses to find what the
character is looking for. Gamemasters may reduce or increase the
time required depending on the specifics of the search. For example, a search for all available information on Damien Knight might
take several days, while compiling all the information available on
a tattooed razorpunk by the name of Zaz may require only a few
minutes. When each search is completed, Shadowland compiles
the requested data in a folder known as a sourcebook.
Characters who visit Shadowland directly via the Matrix
(rather than by using a tortoise) can initiate and complete a search
in 2D6 hours.
Shadowland also allows characters to use their own search
knowbots, as long as those programs are approved by and registered with the Shadowland deckers and programmers-a process
that usually takes less than an hour. Knowbot searches take 2D6
hours. After completing its initial task, a registered knowbot can
remain in the Shadowland matrix and feed its controlling character any new information on the selected topic as soon as the information becomes available.
If desired, gamemasters can increase the difficulty of finding
specific information in Shadowland by applying an appropriate
target number from the Contact Knowledge Table (p. 69) to all
Matrix-based tests made to locate data. Gamemasters may also
increase the search period for characters using tortoises simply by
adding the target number to the number of days required for the
search. (This time increase reflects the painstaking effort required
to access each and every document potentially related to the
topic in question.)
PLAYING CONTACTS
The preceding rules are designed to make playing contacts as
much fun for gamemasters as playing characters is for players. But
even these rules, including the example of Billy Boy and his use of
contacts and FOFs, only scratch the surface of the possibilities such
NPCs represent.
Gamemasters can make their contacts fully realized characters by generating biographies and game statistics as complete as
those of player characters (using any of the various character-creation systems, including Edges and Flaws where applicable).
When contacts and their contacts become more well-rounded
people, gamemasters can find multiple uses for these characters:
as instructors, Enemies (see p. 71), competitors, dupes, moles,
traitors, secret agents, godparents-and any of these roles can
provide the starting point for an adventure or a campaign.
As a twist on the usual role of contacts in a game, some contacts may seek out the player characters in search of information
(game mechanics for these occurrences are provided in Favor for
a Friend, below). In some circumstances, contacts may compete
with player characters to obtain data or resources, a situation that
can quickly develop into bidding and information wars as contacts
play the characters off other NPCs or manipulate events to their
own advantage. Other contacts may be pressured by outside individuals, groups or other mysterious forces to not cooperate with
player characters or even mislead them. Contacts also may be less
than cooperative for their own reasons (game mechanics for such
circumstances appear in Spilling the Beans, p. 69).
Still other contacts can serve as ordinary "men on the
street"-sources of rumors, misinformation and apparently useless information. A casual contact who tells the runners what they
want to know and then goes on to chat about recent weird happenings, an obscure news item, a disturbing, recurring dream, a
problem his wife is having at work or a general decline in the quality of the soyshakes at his local Stuffer Shack provides an excellent method of introducing clues about future events into the
campaign world without restricting the player characters' desire
to control their own destinies.
Finally, by providing contacts with specialized knowledge,
secret histories, unexpected acquaintances or avenues of information that player characters might never suspect, gamemasters
can make contacts surprisingly multi-dimensional or disappointingly narrow in their knowledge, according to the demands of his
game. Asking a talismonger to obtain a gun may be a useless
request, but asking your Thursday-afternoon chess partner at the
local soykaf shop for the home address of a high-ranking Knight
Errant official might lead to a big and unexpected payoff. (Game
mechanics for such circumstances appear in Contact Knowledge,
p. 69).
FAVOR FOR A FRIEND
Nearly every Shadowrun novel and most of the published
adventures contain at least one instance in which someone asks a
runner to perform a "favor for a friend."
The favor-for-a-friend job transcends the usual "work for
nuyen" shadowruns and allows gamemasters to inject unexpected plot twists or introduce new levels of conflict into their campaigns. Favors requested by contacts also allow player characters
to choose their own runs, rather than passively waiting for the
next Mr. Johnson to come along and offer them a job. Pursuing a
shadowrun as a favor to a contact or friend allows runners to
explore personal interests and, more importantly, allows characters to take on opponents and obstacles with the confidence that
the job is not planned as a setup-though it may well become a
trap somewhere along the way. Gamemasters also can tie favor
requests to the Markers system for Karma (see Karma, p. 76).

Sample
Question
"Hey, did you hear that the Big D died?"
"What are your sources saying about Dunkelzahn's
physical remains?"
"Sheesh! I asked one lousy yak one lousy question about the
security on Inauguration night and she couldn't run out
on me fast enough. What's the connection?"
"Nadja Daviar can't be as squeaky clean as she looks.
Get me the name of her personal shopper
and I'll show you the dirt behind her ears."
"Project Ragnarok' obviously means something to
somebody. Will you be the lucky recipient of my
certified credstick, or should I go to one of my
other contacts?"
"What does the phrase 'techno-magical elf cabal' bring to
mind in reference to our late, lamented president?"
In general, as a contact becomes more valuable and helpful,
he is more likely to ask the player character to do him a favor in
return for providing information at some point. Naturally, the
more useful the contact, the more dangerous and troublesome
that favor should be.
CONTACT KNOWLEDGE
The result of a player character's Etiquette Test indicates how
successful she was in persuading a contact to reveal information.
A failed Etiquette Test simply means that the character hasn't convinced the contact to share information-the Etiquette Test does
not indicate what the contact actually knows.
To determine what a contact knows, the gamemaster should
make an Etiquette or Intelligence Test for the contact (use
whichever skill is most appropriate to the situation). Set the test
target number based on the type of information the player character wants from the contact and the Information's apparent
value, as shown on the Contact Knowledge Table. The contact or
FOF level of the contact does not affect the target number.
Generally, a single success on the test means the contact
knows the requested information (as well as the information for
lower target numbers). If the information requested covers a particularly broad spectrum, the gamemaster can adjust the contact's
knowledge higher or lower on a sliding scale based on the number of successes the test generates.
If the Etiquette or Knowledge Test fails, the contact simply
does not know the requested information-though he or she may
still try to be helpful. For example, a contact who doesn't have the
answer the character is looking for may deliberately or inadvertently provide incorrect information for any number of reasons: to
stay on the character's good side by telling him something, to
throw the character off the track, because he believes that his
information is true, as a favor to one of his friends, to save his skin
from his own enemies-the list of reasons goes on forever.
Our friend Billy Boy has dropped in at Droogies to
see if Joe the bartender knows what's up with a certain
megacorp named Renraku. Billy specifically wants to
find out where Renraku is testing its latest cyberdeck
prototype and who's in charge of those trials.
The gamemaster decides that this information
qualifies as fairly sensitive, and so he decides that Joe
will know only part of what's being said on the
streets. He then makes an Etiquette (Street) Test
against a Target Number 8 to determine joe's level of
knowledge regarding the new deck.
The test generates no successes. Consequently.
the only news joe has heard is that Renraku recently
beefed up security at a few of its local warehouses.
SPILLING THE BEANS
As stated earlier, what a contact knows and what he or she is
willing to tell are two very different things. In most Shadowrun
games, gamemasters and players assume that contacts will reveal
any information they know without argument. This section offers
rules that more realistically reflect the facts of life: even contacts
have good days and bad days, personal crises and expensive
habits to support, and on any given day they may give away their
secrets for free or decide to keep their information to themselves- or even worse, to sell it to the highest bidder.
Number

The simplest way to simulate this Interaction between character and contact is to modify the target number for the standard
Etiquette Test that a character makes to obtain information from a
contact. Under the standard Shadowrun rules, the default target
number for this test is 4. This number can change, depending on
the subject of the character's question. For example, a metahuman-rights activist contact may be quite ready to spill the beans
on the local Humanis chapter, but the same contact might be
quite reluctant to answer questions about the local Mob boss,
especially if the mafioso is particularly powerful in the shadows or
if the contact has some sort of professional or personal relationship with the Mafia. In this case, getting information about the HP
from Mongo the metahuman-rights activist may require only a
successful Etiquette (4) Test. Retrieving any information regarding
the local Mob from Mongo the Mafia soldier might require a successful Etiquette (12) Test-a much more difficult task, even
though the character is asking the same contact both questions.
When making the Etiquette Test to determine the contact's
willingness to talk, the gamemaster can also use the number of
successes from the test to determine how much information the
contact reveals. The greater the number of successes, the more
the contact tells. (This is the system used in all published
Shadowrun adventures.)
Alternatively, gamemasters can make all Etiquette and
Negotiation Tests opposed tests. In this case, the player character
makes his test per standard rules. The gamemaster makes the
opposed test for the contact, applying any appropriate target
modifiers from the Contact Opposed Test Table (p. 71). The target
number for the contact tests is the Charisma of the player character. Subtract the total number of successes generated by the contact's Etiquette or Negotiation Test from the total successes generated on the player character's Etiquette Test. The result determines how much information the contact reveals: the greater the
number of successes, the more the contact tells.
If the contact's test generates more successes than the player character's test, the gamemaster may decide that the contact
simply refuses to tell the character much of anything, or the contact might spin tall tales or give misleading information.
Note that the modifiers in the Contact Opposed Test Table
can be used for opposed tests made during bargaining, interrogation, or any other negotiation situation.

Billy Boy still wants that information
about Renraku, so he visits Timmons the
cop. First, the gamemaster makes an
Etiquette Test for Timmons to determine if
the cop knows anything about the new
Renraku deck prototype. The gamemaster
sets the Target Number at 8 (Renraku would
understandably keep security tight around
the project). The test generates 2 successes,
and so the gamemaster decides that
Timmons knows who's running the prototype testing, and where the testing lab is
located. (If pressed. the gamemaster will
explain that Timmons knows this info
because Renraku hired Lone Star to provide
some extra patrols around the lab site and to
control after-hours access to it.)
Next. Billy Boy makes the standard
Etiquette Test to get Timmons talking. The
information is sensitive, so the gamemaster
sets the Target Number at 8. Billy receives an
extra die on the test, because Timmons is a
Level 2 contact, but Billy's test still only generates 2 successes.
Next, the gamemaster makes an
opposed test for Timmons to determine
what he tells Billy. The base target number
for the Etiquette (Street) Test equals Billy's
Charisma Rating of 4. A +I target modifier
applies because Timmons is a Level 2 contact to Billy, but the information is also
potentially harmful to the "target" (in this
case. Renraku), so a -2 target modifier
applies as well. That produces a final Target
Number 3.
The test for Timmons generates 4 successes, which negate Billy Boy's 2 successes.
Consequently, Timmons tells Billy to stay
away from Renraku. He says can't believe
that Billy would even think about asking
Timmons to jeopardize his job by revealing
such information. In the end, Billy Boy doesn't get
the Information he wanted-but he realizes that
Timmons is too scared to talk and deduces that Lone
Star is somehow involved in the security around the
new cyberdeck project.
ENEMIES
All shadowrunners make enemies during the course of their
careers. It goes with the territory. Shadowrunners who are doing
their jobs are bound to make someone angry at some point.
They lie, steal, own more weapons than small armies (and probably killed someone to get them) and regularly foil the plans of
evil megacorporate execs, Mob bosses, and other assorted

CREATING ENEMIES
Gamemasters may create personal Enemies for all player
characters during the character creation process. Enemies may be
individuals or organizations, ranging from spurned lovers to disgruntled contacts to the buddies of a dead partner to paramilitary
groups and even whole megacorps. Personal Enemies can
become team Enemies and vice versa. And if a character's life
proceeds along normal lines for a shadowrunner, he or she will
continue to collect Enemies like trophies throughout his or her
career. Every time a character or team makes a big score, destroys

property, steals a researcher's life's work, extracts a wageslave or
performs some other action that results in collateral damage to life
and livelihood, their name appears on someone's drek list-and
what they did will come back to haunt them if their target has the
opportunity, power, contacts or resources to make them pay for
what they did. In short, the very nature of a shadowrunner's existence guarantees that the character will always have an Enemy or
two or three plotting against him or her, ever alert for the chance
to get a little payback.
To create an Enemy or Enemies for a player character, the
gamemaster first determines the character's Enemy Rating.
according to the Enemy Rating Table. The more powerful and
influential a character is, the more trouble he will attract, and so a
character's resources provide a convenient basis for the Enemy
Rating. Characters with low Resources will have Enemies
designed using a relatively low Enemy Rating: characters with
high Resources will have Enemies designed using a relatively high
Enemy Rating. The Enemies You Deserve table suggests rough
guidelines for the type of Enemy each Enemy Rating represents.
Gamemasters can allocate an Enemy's Rating
as they see fit. For example, a gamemaster can
give a character with Resource Priority A a single
Enemy at an Enemy Rating of 4, two Enemies
each at Enemy Rating 2, four Enemies each at
Enemy Rating 1. one Rating 3 Enemy and one
Rating 1 Enemy, and so on. Remember that certain character Flaws Increase the number of or
ratings for a character's Enemies (see Edges and
Flaws, p. 21.
Though the Enemy Rating Table includes
Ratings 5 and 6 Enemies, these types of opponents are probably best reserved for over-thetop supervillain games. A high-Rating Enemy's
efforts to catch or kill a character can easily
become the major theme of a campaign-and
such campaigns can quickly become tiresome
for other players if the gamemaster cannot find
a way to keep their characters Involved in the
game. In most cases, no single character should
start a game with a Rating 5 or 6 Enemy,
though the Hunted Flaw (see p. 33) might justify such a circumstance.
ENEMY CHARACTERISTICS
Every Enemy is defined by three characteristics: Power, Motivation and Knowledge. As
shown in the Enemy Rating Table, the Enemy
Rating determines how many total
Characteristic Points the gamemaster may
assign to the characteristics. The gamemaster
assigns each characteristic a Rating of 0-6, basing the number of points on the type of Enemy
being created, the demands of the campaign,
the character's actions and the complexity of
the gamemaster's (and/or player's) plan for the
player character's ultimate fate. (The Characteristic Points can also
be thought of as "drek points." because they represent how much
drek the Enemy can throw at the character.) Depending on how
the gamemaster weights the Enemy characteristics, that Enemy
may be a persistent annoyance or a constant threat, or every
attack may seem arbitrary-the character simply doesn't see a
connection, and trouble from the Enemy always comes as a complete surprise. An Enemy makes an ideal plot device for sending
off a character with the Borrowed Time Flaw (p. 25) in a blaze of
giory (and helping out the team in the process).
Power
An Enemy's Power rating indicates the resources the Enemy
can use to harass the character. For example, an Enemy with a low
Power Rating (1 to 2 points), such as a corporate secretary, can't
perform a hit herself. To harass a character, a corporate secretary
will have to come up with a low-tech, easy way to hurt a character-like tipping off the cops. An Enemy with a moderate Power
Rating (3 to 4 points) might be able to geek the character himself,

or he'll have the resources to hire assassins to do the job. An
Enemy with a high Power Rating (5 to 6 points) can mess with a
character any way she pleases. She can send an initiatory group
full of physad killers after the character, sabotage his contacts, buy
off his closest friends, or slowly destroy everything he's ever held
dear.
An Enemy with a Power level of 0 has little means to hurt a
character. However, such Enemies can spread nasty rumors very
effectively and bide their time.
Motivation
An Enemy's Motivation Rating indicates how badly the
Enemy wants to hurt the character. An Enemy with low
Motivation (1 to 2 points) might simply want to "teach that punk
a lesson" and will settle for smacking the character around or
stealing his possessions. An Enemy with moderate Motivation (3
to 4 points) will want to beat the character to within a centimeter
of his life or "do back what he did to me." An Enemy with high
Motivation (5 to 6 points) will continent-hop and go into lowEarth orbit to track down the character and exact revenge.
An Enemy with Motivation O may wait for the character to fall
into her lap-which can be arranged, with cruel gamemaster plotting.
Knowledge
An Enemy's Knowledge Rating indicates how much the
Enemy knows about the character's whereabouts. An Enemy with
low Knowledge (1 to 2 points) has no idea of the character's location. If the character's face appears on a KSAF broadcast, the
Enemy might see it and figure out where the character was a
month ago. An Enemy with moderate Knowledge (3 to 4 points)
knows which city the character calls home, but must wait for the
character to make the first move in order to pinpoint his or her
current location. An Enemy with high Knowledge (5 points) might
have round-the-clock surveillance on the character, or be an intimate, trusted friend turned sour. An Enemy with Knowledge
Rating 6 knows exactly where the character is as play begins.
An Enemy with Knowledge 0 has feelers out trying to locate
the character but the trail is ice cold.
When Kelly created her decker character, St.
Jude, she decided that Jude was raised to believe in
God and the sanctity of the family, and that her
father, a moderately successful businessman, was
always right. When he informed his daughter that she
was to marry an elderly, ailing rival businessman.
Jude's faith in her father's judgment was completely
destroyed. Trained as an information specialist (business jargon for "decker") Jude found it easy to steal
proprietary data from both her father's and her
fiancé's businesses. She then sold that data, bought
herself a cyberdeck and took off for Denver.
The gamemaster decides that Jude has 3
Enemies-her ex-fiancé, her father and the head of
her father's security team, whom she used to get to
the information and then hung out to dry.
Kelly set Jude's Resources Priority Level at A
during character creation, so that means Jude has an
Enemy Rating of 4. The gamemaster divides the
Enemy Rating as follows:
Father
Rating 1
Power: 0
Motivation: 3
Knowledge: 1
Daddy is moderately angry with Jude. He has a
rough idea where she might have run, but lacks the
power to find her or bring her back.
Ex-Fiancé
Rating 1
Power: 1
Motivation: 3
Knowledge: 0
Jude's ex-fiancé is moderately miffed at her sudden departure. He has the power and resources to do
something about being dumped and ripped off. but
doesn't know where to start looking.
Security Head
Rating 2
Power: 1
Motivation: 4
Knowledge: 1
The security head is really angry at Jude-she
made him look like a fool and tarnished his reputation. He has the power to track her down, and he has
a rough idea of where she is.
Jude's troubles really begin if her Enemies
decide to cooperate-and in this situation. they
might easily do just that.
USING ENEMIES
Once the gamemaster establishes an Enemy for a character.
that Enemy can become more and less influential throughout the
course of the campaign. The Enemy's initial rating may increase or
decrease depending on the character's actions, the campaign's
story line, events elsewhere in the universe-or, to be honest,
gamemaster whim. Used judiciously, an Enemy can spice up a
campaign, derail a carefully laid plan, launch a shadowrun, add a
much-needed or disastrously ill-timed complication (depending
on your point of view), or even distract a character by not showIng up when expected. Gamemasters choose when, how and why
an Enemy surfaces and may raise or lower the Enemy's ratings and
Characteristic Points according to the current threat the Enemy
poses. The gamemaster can also simply adjust the Enemy's
actions to suit the story's needs, without crunching the numbers.
Managing multiple Enemies for multiple characters can
become tricky, but if gamemasters can find a way to successfully
track all the Enemies of a shadowrunning team, the rewards in

roleplaying and storytelling will make the effort worthwhile. From
adding a touch of gritty realism to an adventure to contriving the
most fantastic and humorous coincidences, Enemies offer a
gamemaster a multitude of useful, enjoyable options in his or her
Shadowrun game.
As in real life, the potential for mayhem increases exponentially when Enemles join forces against a character or team.
Though the partnership may fall apart before the Enemies accomplish their shared goal, together they represent a greater threat
than any Enemy individually. Combining the Enemy Ratings of
multiple Enemies would quickly send their threat level off the
charts, and so gamemasters should simply create an operation of
appropriate size and menace to let the player characters know
that the drek they're standing in has reached new heights.
Circumstances force Jude to make a run into
New Orleans, her hometown. While she's there,
she's spotted by a friend of the family who informs
her father. The gamemaster decides that her father, a
Rating | Enemy, instantly becomes a Rating 2 Enemy
with appropriate Increases to his Motivation, Power
and Knowledge Ratings. Similarly, the security
head's rating increases to Rating 3. Jude's appearance really rankles her ex-fiancé, however, whose
rating jumps to Rating 3.
Jude quickly completes her business in New
Orleans and escapes to Seattle before any of her
Enemies catch up with her. Her father quickly loses
interest in punishing his daughter and soon becomes
a Rating O Enemy. Other business demands the attention of her ex-fiancé, who reverts to a Rating | Enemy.
However, the security head picks up her trail while
she's in town and grows determined to catch her. He
remains a Rating 3 Enemy and follows her to Seattle.
Why an Enemy May Want to Kill Your Character
The following list represents only a fraction of the innumerable reasons an Enemy may have it in for a character. People turn
into Enemies for both more and less serious reasons than these,
and each of the reasons provided here has many variations. Be
creative-imagine the player character's surprise when he discovers that the mysterious force that has been messing with his cred
rating for the past two years and causing him no end of headaches
and embarrassment is none other than his former accountant,
whom the character only left because his sister married a CPA.
· You left her for dead, or something close to it.
. You ruined his career/business/art, and he has nothing left to
lose by hunting you down.
· You burned/blackmailed/double-crossed/set her up-was it for
your profit or for her own good?
· You're a (INSERT CHARACTER'S METATYPE/ETHNICITY/POLITICAL AFFILIATION/RELIGION HERE), and he's gonna put you in
your place.
. She's been competing with you since childhood. Now it's serious.
. His job or sense of honor requires him to hunt you down.
· You and she used to be friends, teammates or lovers. She never
forgave you when you left.
. He's just plain mean and petty, and you're a convenient target.
· Stuff as dangerous as what you've gotten hold of can't be
allowed to fall into the wrong hands.
. For some reason he thinks you're the baddest mage/

· You killed someone she cared about-a friend. spouse, lover,

as a researcher, informant or contact.
· They want to "make an example" of you.
· They hate what you represent-your cause, your person, whatever.

maybe to the law.
You have something she needs for career advancement.
. You ruined or delayed their master plan with your deliberate or
unknowing actions.
· You're on opposite sides of the law-but now it's getting personal.
· She's jealous of what you can do or the way you live.

. You just uncovered their conspiracy, and they have to silence you.
· She just doesn't like shadowrunners.
DEATH AT THE ENEMY'S HAND
The primary purpose of Enemies in a Shadowrun campaign
is to keep the characters on their toes-and nothing keeps a person on his toes more effectively than the constant threat of imminent death. At times, Enemies may devote all their time, energy
and resources toward getting rid of a character or team or.
depending on the other distractions occupying their attention,
Enemies may limit their efforts toward eliminating a character or
team to passive surveillance. Regardless of the Enemy's current
level of Interest in a character or team. the gamemaster can
always find ways to remind the character or team that the Enemy
still exists, still knows where they are, and still intends to take care
of them as soon as it's convenient. An Enemy is always a threat.
even if the character or team is not his or her current target.
After all the build-up of an Enemy hunting down a character
or team throughout a series of adventures or campaigns, with
each event bringing the character or team a little closer to death,
if the Enemy is going to succeed in his goal the final denouement
must be dramatic and meaningful. If the gamemaster's group
enjoys a realistic style of play, the Enemy may kill the character in
cold blood and the player may not object to this harsh ending to
his character's life. If, however, players are particularly attached to
their characters-as well they might be. considering the amount
of time and effort required to create and maintain them-the
gamemaster should design a big death scene that will satisfy
everyone's sense of fair play and serve as a major event in the
campaign. A character's death should mean something: his sacrifice could keep the team alive: his death might provide the necessary breakthrough in a case to bring down the bad guy; her
heroic action may change the course of someone else's life, and if
the character lingers long enough, she might be able to die with

the satisfaction of knowing her death accomplished some good;
the character might die in the process of killing the Enemy (a classic climax to a story)-the possibilities are limited only by the
gamemaster's imagination.
Miraculous Escapes
Often, gamemasters and players may be reluctant to let a
character die. The player may have spent a lot of time developing the character, the character may play a key role in the
gamemaster's campaign plans, the group may simply like the
character too much-there are many reasons why a character should escape death.
In these cases, gamemasters can arrange circumstances that foil the Enemy's efforts to kill the character. Anyone who's read comic books or seen
action films will already know a handful of
ways to keep a character alive in the face of
obviously superior Enemies and daunting
odds. For example, characters may survive explosions by sheltering behind or in
a convenient vehicle/steel crate/pile of
building materials/vault: escape from a
sniper by being nursed back to health
by a kindly stranger; overcome grievous
Injury through cyber- or bioware
replacements; suddenly manifest
magical ability under pressure and
walk away from an attack completely unscathed (physically, at
least): and so on. Alternatively, the
gamemaster can decide that a
character's Enemies have some
fate other than death in store for
the character. The following list
provides reasons why an Enemy might
not kill a character when he or she really
should.
. They aren't in it for revenge, they want the
money they lost. Placate them.
· They don't want you dead-they want you
to suffer.
· They don't want you dead yet-they want you to
suffer first.
· Killing people is illegal and unjustified. You're going to prison.
· They want you dead, but you've got something to hold
over them.
· They don't want you dead-they want you to join the Hive.
. They don't want you dead-they want to offer you a suicide
mission.
· They'll give you a sporting chance.
· You'll do nicely as an experimental subject-or food for the
others.
. They want to humiliate you and force you to do something that
violates your code of honor.
. They want the names and addresses of your accomplices and
your employer.
· They've left you strapped to the bomb/rear bumper/diving bell
from which "no one could possibly escape."
· They want to "expose" you as a corporate informant and let your
friends or associates turn on you.
· They won't dirty their hands-but Rocco's on his way, and Rocco
never washes anyway.
. They're going to set you up in order to put their plans into
motion.
. Your would-be assassin doesn't really trust his bosses anyway.
and you've just convinced him that they'll have someone killing
him next.
· They weren't really after you in the first placetell them who they want, quickly.
· You've got powerful friends you never
knew about. Of course, they'll expect
something in return for saving your hoop .
· The ritual must take place at a certain
time (bwah-ha-ha). You wait in this cell.
. "No really, I'm on your sideINSERT ENEMY'S NAME HERE is on
the way! Let's get out of here!"
KILLING ENEMIES
Killing an Enemy should be a
cathartic and momentous event-a
climax of biblical proportions. The
death of an Enemy should have
as much impact in the game as
the death of a character, and
can happen for as many different reasons. An Enemy might
also survive a team's efforts
to kill him or her for the same
reasons that a character escapes
death. Killing an Enemy. however,
does not guarantee that he or she is
gone from a character's life. Player
characters may learn the hard way that
there's more to living a carefree existence
than geeking all their Enemies.
Usually, attempts to kill bad guys simply
make them madder. Shadowrun gamemasters
can use a wide variety of explanations to justify why an
Enemy keeps coming back, even after the team thought he or she
was dead. Begin with the ever-popular, "Did you see/find the
body?" and move on to escapes based on magic, cyberware, or a
combination of any number of devices to explain the Enemy's
continued existence.
If it serves the story for a character or team to actually succeed in killing their Enemy, the conflict rarely ends there. Enemies
are people too, and they will have friends, relatives, co-workers.
hive-mates, mentors, protégés, contacts, bodyguards, employers
and any number of other interested parties willing and able to
avenge their deaths-and to step into their shoes as a new.
improved, unknown Enemy.

T
he Advanced Rules section provides new ways to look at existing rules. These rules
expand and modify the uses of Karma, offer suggestions for returning wonder and mystery to the use of magic, provide guidelines for designing appropriate opposition for player characters, suggest rules for maintaining the state-of-the-art in technology and magic,
propose a variety of ways for characters to retire and offer several miscellaneous rules that
tweak specific areas of the current rules system.
KARMA
The Shadowrun game mechanic of Karma represents a character's accumulated experience and actions. By investing time and energy into certain aspects of his or her personal development or by performing good deeds, a character can earn Karma Points-a sort of cosmic
"brownie points." In turn, these Karma Points improve the character's abilities and options. (See pp.
190-91, SRII, for further information.)
AWARDING KARMA: A CLARIFICATION
In SRII, players are Instructed to distribute their characters' Karma using the following guidelines: "Of the Karma a character gets, 90 percent of it becomes Good Karma, which is used over
the long term for improving the character. Ten percent goes into the character's Karma Pool for
short-term butt-saving. A character's Good Karma and Karma Pool are tracked separately. Always
round off in favor of Good Karma."
In simpler terms, a character who receives 10 points of Good Karma adds the next Good
Karma Point he earns to his Karma Pool. Then the cycle begins again. The next 10 points go to Good
Karma, followed by a point to his Karma Pool, and so on.

BALANCING KARMA AND NUYEN
Most experienced Shadowrun gamemasters have faced the
problem of balancing the amount of Karma and nuyen that player
characters earn during a campaign.
The problem of too much or too little nuyen or Karma arises
because different player characters may have radically different
needs. On one hand, characters reliant on technology need nuyen
to maintain their cyberdecks and implants and to buy all the latest
tech toys. On the other hand, using magic generally requires large
amounts of Karma, and characters who use magic often become
"Karma vacuums," never having enough Karma to accomplish
what they want to do. A few characters hover in the middle,
requiring both Karma and nuyen to remain effective in their role
on the team. Consequently, the gamemaster must carefully dispense cash and Karma so that players have enough for their needs
but not enough to unbalance the campaign.
Though gamemasters can easily take excess money away
from characters, keeping Karma under control can be a bit trickier. The Karma-for-Cash and Cash-for-Karma exchanges provide
options for managing Karma assets.
Karma for Cash
Under the Karma-for-Cash exchange rule. the gamemaster
provides opportunities for player characters to cash in Good
Karma Points for nuyen or equivalent resources.
Such opportunities represent "lucky breaks" that come a
character's way-someone paying off an old favor, a sudden
windfall, an easy score, winning the lottery and so on.
Gamemasters should determine the amount of
money/resources a character receives in exchange for Karma
based on the average levels of nuyen characters possess in the
campaign. For example, characters in a relatively down-scale
campaign might receive 100 nuyen for each Good Karma Point
they cash in. In a more upscale campaign, a single Good Karma
Point might be worth 1,000 nuyen. For random, infrequent windfalls. gamemasters can roll dice to determine how much money a
character receives. For example, a gamemaster might determine
the amount of a windfall by rolling 2D6 and multiplying the result
by 10.
In any case, Karma Points that are cashed in for nuyen or
other assets are permanently gone, in the same way as if the character had spent the points to buy a new skill.
Additionally, individual gamemasters should set their own
limits on how frequently characters can cash in Karma and how
much Karma they can exchange at any one time. Because the
workings of Luck and Fate are unpredictable and mysterious, feel
free to alter these limits throughout the course of the campaign.
or set new limits for each exchange.
Cash for Karma
In the Cash-for-Karma option, a character may exchange
nuyen for Karma Points.
Such exchanges may represent a character giving money to
a church or charity, gambling it away in honor of Lady Luck (perfect for a Coyote shaman), spending it on a "magical lifestyle" that
enables the character to perform daily devotions and rituals to
boost her Karma, and so on.
Individual gamemasters should determine the "nuyen cost"
of Karma Points in their campaigns. Low nuyen costs will enable
characters to more easily purchase Karma and may encourage
player characters to take up magic. Higher nuyen costs will have
the opposite effect.
Regardless of the temptation, players should avoid bankrupting their characters just to gain a couple of extra Karma Points.
Having a lot of Karma does a character very little good when she
can't pay her rent!
KARMA AND THE AMORAL CAMPAIGN
As a race, we humans like to believe that the cosmos rewards
constructive and productive actions more readily than greedy or
destructive ones. As is clearly indicated in the rules for Karma and
the Karma awards suggested in every published adventure, the
Shadowrun rules reflect this belief by rewarding characters who
do good deeds and punishing those who fail to do the right thing.
While history and fiction both provide numerous examples of
people who live and act outside the law behaving in a heroic fashion, those same sources prove many times over that being bad
can be a whole lot of fun. Rich and powerful people don't worry
about the cosmos rewarding them: they have enough money and
influence to create their own luck.
By definition, shadowrunners live outside the law. While that
doesn't automatically make them evil, it also doesn't automatically mean that they act like Robin Hood. For every group of shadowrunners looking to make a difference in the world and change
things for the better, there is a shadowrunning team willing to do
anything for nuyen. Neither approach is the only right choice,
because in roleplaying the right choice is the one that lets the
group have the most fun. Though the Shadowrun rules encourage
the heroic attitude, the Shadowrun universe seems custom-made
for skilled opportunists, both player-characters and NPCs.
In those Shadowrun games where the player characters (and
most NPCs) are amoral, if not downright immoral, gamemasters
may use a variation of the Cash-for-Karma exchange system to
allow characters to purchase Karma. This arrangement enables
characters to obtain Karma Points to use for character improvement and growth without performing good deeds against their
nature and inclinations. When using this system, the gamemaster
makes no standard Karma awards during the campaign: player
characters must obtain all Karma by purchasing it. The gamemaster sets any limits on the amount of Karma characters can purchase at any one time.
The player must first announce his intention to purchase
Karma for his character, at which point the gamemaster determines the cost using the following formula: 3D6 x 100 = nuyen
cost of 1 Karma Point. Keeping the cost of Karma unpredictable
prevents players from keeping a running calculation of how much
Karma their character can afford at any given time, thereby more
closely matching the basically random system for receiving Karma
under the standard rules.
Per the standard rules, a character must obtain 10 Good
Karma Points before he can gain a Karma Pool Point.

FAVORS AND MARKERS
Favors and markers offer additional optional uses for Karma
in Shadowrun. A favor represents the obligation of an NPC to perform a service or action for a player character. A marker represents
an obligation of a player character to perform a service or action
for an NPC. Favors provide a way for characters to spend Karma
Points. Markers let them earn Karma Points. Favors and markers
may be negotiated between characters and contacts, friends,
neighbors, family, business associates or any other NPCs with
whom the character regularly comes into contact: favors and
markers might just as easily be bargained for with strangers who
happen to be in the right place at the right time.
For 1 Good Karma Point, a player character can purchase a
favor from an NPC. For the purposes of the favor, the NPC acts like
a Level 1 contact (see Contact Levels, p. 62) and maintains a
Friendly attitude toward the character for the purpose of Social
Skill Tests (p.180, SRII). If desired, gamemasters may give player
characters the option to substitute favors for Karma awards at the
end of adventures. This practice enables characters to store up a
few favors that they can collect on when necessary.
When an NPC (never another player character) calls in a marker. the player character must perform the requested service or
action. If the player character performs the requested service, she
receives at least | Karma Point. Gamemasters may increase the
Karma Points earned if performing the service is especially difficult for the character.
Only players can agree to markers for their characters, though
gamemasters may encourage the use of favors and markers by
having NPCs negotiate for markers when dealing with characters
("I'll do this for you and you can owe me one."), Characters can
also trade a marker for a future favor from an NPC.
KARMA POOLS
A character's Karma Pool reflects a character's accumulated
"luck." Generally, Karma Pool Points give more experienced characters an advantage over less experienced characters with the
same levels of ability, lending support to the maxim, "age and
treachery will beat youth and skill every time."
The following rules enable gamemasters to expand the use of
and more closely control Karma Pools in their games. The
gamemaster and all players in a group should agree on any variant Karma Pool uses before incorporating them into their game.
Limiting Karma Pools
In some cases, player characters may amass huge Karma Pools
that enable them to escape dangerous situations with little effort. By
limiting Karma Pools in their games, gamemasters can force characters to reduce their reliance on Karma Pools to escape harm.
Reducing the rate at which characters earn Karma Pool Points
is the simplest way to do this. Under the standard rules, characters must earn 10 Good Karma Points before earning a Karma
Pool Point (see Awarding Karma: A Clarification, p. 76).
Reducing this rate, so that characters must earn 20 Karma Points
before they can earn a Karma Pool Point, will keep characters
Karma Pools smaller and make it easier for the gamemaster to
maintain game balance.
Gamemasters may also use a staggered-rate system for
increasing Karma Pools, Under this system, a character earns
Karma Pool Points at the standard rate until the Karma Pool reaches 5. From 6 to 10, the character earns | Karma Pool Point for
every 20 Good Karma Points. When the Karma Pool reaches 10
points, the character then earns | Karma Pool Point for every 30
Good Karma Points. The staggered-rate system makes acquiring
very high Karma Pools extremely difficult and tends to even the
playing field between more and less experienced characters.
Split Karma Pools
Split Karma Pools, or subpools, provide another means of
reducing a character's reliance on a single, massive Karma Pool.
This option also provides players with additional opportunities to
"customize" their characters by creating strengths and weaknesses according to the type of Karma Pools designed and the allocation of Karma Points to each pool, and slows down Karma Pool
advancement by forcing players to divide all Karma earned
between multiple, potentially exclusive pools.
Under standard Karma Pool rules, a player character can use
his Karma Pool Points to purchase additional dice for nearly any
test. Under the Split Karma Pools system, the character must
divide his Karma Pool Points among several subpools, which then
may be used to purchase dice only for specific tests.
For example, in addition to the usual pools-Control,
Hacking, Magic and Combat-the gamemaster may incorporate
the Athletics, Social and Dodge pools described in Skills and
Training, p. 48. Depending on what strengths a player wants to
emphasize for his character, he may also designate even more
specialized skill pools, such as Negotiation, Electronics or Biology.
If the gamemaster approves, characters may use dice from a subpool to make a test for a related skill. For example, because the
Negotiation skill is linked to the Leadership skill on the Skill Web,
the character could use the Negotiation Subpool dice to make a
Leadership Skill Test. For such default-skill applications of Karma
dice, subpool points are worth only half their normal value.
Though a Build/Repair Subpool would have little impact on
game play, characters such as riggers, deckers and others who
rely on such skills to maintain their edge on the streets might find
such a pool extremely valuable.
Extended Actions
Gamemasters may also allow player characters to use Karma
Pool Points when performing time-consuming actions such as
writing Matrix utilities, spell research, enchanting and other activities that require hours, days or even longer periods of time to
complete.
Under this option, the character must allocate Karma Pool
Points to the skill test for the action when the extended activity
begins, even if the required skill test comes at the end of the task.
In addition, the Karma Pool does not refresh until the action is
completed. For example, if a decker character spends 2 Karma
Points to add dice to a Computer Skill Test to write a program that
requires 3 days to complete, her Karma Pool does not refresh
until she has finished writing the program.

Permanent Karma Loss
Finally, gamemasters can limit the size of characters' Karma
Pools by increasing the number of Karma Pool uses that result in
permanent Karma loss.
Under the standard rules, a player character loses any Karma
Pool Points he uses to buy test successes (see p. 191. SRII). These
points are not replaced when the Karma Pool refreshes-the character must earn new Karma Points to replace them. Similarly,
gamemasters can simply declare that other specific uses of Karma
result in the loss of Karma Points. The gamemaster and all players
should agree on any affected Karma uses before using this option
in a game.
HAND OF GOD
The Hand of God rule allows player characters to spend their
entire store of Karma-both Good Karma and Karma Pool
Points-in a single instant.
The rule is designed for use when a character faces dire circumstances and no single Karma Pool will save his hoop-like
when that high-powered sniper rifle goes off and the character is
seeing that bright white light at the end of the tunnel. This use of
Karma represents divine intervention-the Big Wheel of Fate
deciding that the character's time on this planet is not yet up and
miraculously pulling him from the very jaws of Death.
Gamemasters can explain this phenomena with any rationale they
like, from sheer coincidence to the intervention of gods, totems,
loa and so on.
To use Hand of God. a character must possess at least 1
Karma Pool Point. When the character burns all her Karma at once
to avoid certain death, these points are gone. The character has no
Karma until she earns new Karma Points.
Understandably, losing all of one's Karma can be a traumatic
event for a character. To reflect this, the character must make a
Willpower (6) Test. If the test fails, the character receives a mental
Flaw, selected by the controlling player. After the player selects the
Flaw, the gamemaster selects a mental Edge of equal or lesser value
(see Edges and Flaws, p. 21) for the character. The Flaw represents
the trauma of the experience, and the Edge represents the strength
the character gained from surviving the experience. The character
retains the Flaw and Edge for the remainder of her life.
A character may use the Hand of God only once.
MAGIC
Ideally, characters should view magic in the Shadowrun universe as a mysterious, unpredictable force that exposes its users
to great risk, as well as providing them with great power.
However, as players have grown increasingly familiar with the
magic rules over the past few years, characters no longer fear magic's
random and unpredictable nature. In addition, some magician characters have amassed enormous powers that disrupt game balance
and make the life of their teams much safer-and a lot less fun.
The rules in this section are designed to remedy these problems by providing gamemasters with new ways to inject more
unpredictability and danger into the use of magic, restrict the
power of magician characters, and reduce the total amount of
magic in their games.
Those players anxiously awaiting a dramatic, noticeable rise
in the magic level of the universe should keep in mind that all
Shadowrun magic depends on the level of mana, a natural force
that rises and falls in a cycle that lasts thousands of years.
Currently, the universe's mana level is simply not high enough to
power specialty magic items other than foci. Some day the mana
level may rise high enough to power such items and make possible other unimaginable magical feats.
Of course, mana is a mysterious and unknown force, so no
one can truly predict what course it will take, That said, various
Shadowrun books such as Threats, Harlequin's Back and
Awakenings contain subtle hints and clues about the ebb and flow
of mana, and interested players will find continuing clues to coming changes in future Shadowrun releases.
INITIATION
Magical initiation (see The Grimoire and Awakenings
sourcebooks) provides magical characters with access to new abilities and options such as metamagic, and gives them nearly
unlimited potential to develop increasing amounts of power.
The following options provide gamemasters with ways to
control magical initiations in their games, and to make initiation
more accessible to characters who are not well-acquainted with
the complex rules of initiation and metamagic.
Restricting Initiation
Ideally, magical initiation represents a character's magical
education and slow accumulation of wisdom. All too often, however, magician characters undergo initiation as soon as possible to
reap the benefits it provides. In some campaigns, this may be
acceptable and even desirable. Generally, however, a rash of
"rampant initiations" can ruin the balance of a game.
Gamemasters can restrict initiations in several ways. Most
simply, gamemasters can prohibit player characters from using
the Force Points from their allocated Resources to create startingcharacter initiates.
Alternatively, the gamemaster can require that a teacher,
spirit-helper or magical group of some kind assist during the first
Initiation of any character. By controlling the availability of suitable
teachers, the gamemaster can control initiations in his campaigns.
Additionally, the search for a suitable teacher can become an
adventure goal and provide the character with a chance to earn
some extra Karma toward initiation. Players may prefer this simple initiation restriction because it preserves most of their choices-once the character has achieved Initiate Grade Rating 0, he is
free to self-initiate per standard rules.
Gamemasters can also limit initiations by requiring that characters undergo ordeals for all initiations or when attempting to
reach specific Grade Ratings (see pp. 39-41, Grimoire and pp.
113-14. Awakenings for ordeal rules). Ordeal requirements work
especially well with the gradual initiation system described below.
Gradual Initiation
The knowledge and abilities provided by initiation represent
a quantum leap in the development of a magician. Some
gamemasters may prefer to change this vast leap into a series of

short hops so that they can better control the abilities that a magician gains as he is initiated. Additionally, this system reduces the
power gap between initiates and non-initiates.
Under the gradual-initiation system, the magician does not
gain access to all of the abilities of metamagic at once. Instead,
the character starts out with a basic "package" of initiate abilities
at Grade 0. Then, as the initiate achieves each successive Grade,
he can learn one of the existing metamagical abilities. Thus, a
magician will not know all of the metamagical abilities until he
reaches Grade 6.
The Grade 0 "basic package" consists of all the "astral abilities" of initiation: an Astral Pool, a bonus to Astral Reaction and
the ability to travel to the metaplanes (characters with astral projection only), along with all of the abilities associated with performing Astral Quests (see p. 93, Grimoire). The magician might
then learn the metamagical abilities in the following order:
Masking, Shielding. Centering, Dispelling. Quickening and
Anchoring.
Individual gamemasters can set the order in which the character learns the remaining metamagical abilities or simply allow
characters to pick one ability per Grade. The order will have little
effect on game balance, and different magical organizations are
likely to teach the abilities in different sequences. Furthermore,
letting characters select the order in which they will learn metamagic or setting different learning sequences for different characters
will foster greater variety among initiates.
Gamemasters can treat the additional metamagical abilities
described in Awakenings (pp. 99-100) as parts of their "parent"
metamagical skills or consider each additional ability separately
for the purposes of acquiring metamagic.
The gradual initiation system sharply limits the abilities of
starting initiates and reduces Initiation to a valuable goal, rather
than an amazing, unmanageable leap in knowledge. The gradual
initiation system also increases the Karma costs of gaining new
Grades, providing another option for controlling the amount of
Karma in a game.
UNPREDICTABLE HAZARDS OF MAGIC
Despite research on the nature of magic. it remains a sometimes fickle and unpredictable force in the twenty-first century.
Though the various magical traditions possess techniques, rituals
and spells that work well 99 percent of the time, no one truly
understands how magic functions. Consequently, every now and
then attempts to use magic result in unexplainable events that
range from the humorous to the horrible-events that have given
rise to numerous rumors of unlucky spellcasters being dragged
screaming into some netherworld by demons or suffering from
mental breakdowns because they saw Something Man Was Not
Meant to Know.
Of course, the Shadowrun rulebook provides fairly comprehensive and specific rules about how magic works. The detailed
nature of the game rules sometimes creates the impression that
the inhabitants of the Sixth World also understand how magic
works. The following rules are designed to correct that impression
and provide gamemasters with a few ideas for keeping magic a
wild, mysterious, unpredictable and dangerous phenomenon in
their games.
Magical Misfires
The Rule of One (p. 32, SRII) is the simplest way to trigger
magical misfires. Whenever a magician's Magical Skill Test yields
all Is, his use of magic creates some strange and unpredictable
effect. Most magicians, however, have so many dice to throw
around on their Magical Tests that a result of all Is is exceedingly
rare.
Therefore, gamemasters may wish to employ the following
Rule of One variant (first introduced in Fields of Fire). Under the
Rule of One variant, a magical misfire occurs whenever the number of Is rolled on a Magical Test equals or exceeds the base Skill
or Force Rating used for the test. Thus, a magician who uses several bonus dice on a test increases the chance that his spell will
misfire. A magician using a high Skill Rating and a spell with a
high Force Rating decreases his chances of a misfire.
Bubba the mage decides to throw a Force 4
Fireball at the go-ganger trying to run him down.
Bubba uses 6 dice from his Magic Pool on the test,
which generates the following results: 10, 9, 7, 4, 4,
3. 1. 1. 1. 1. Bubba's spell misfires and toasts him
where he stands.
Whenever a magical misfire occurs, the magical forces
escape the magician's control and create an unpredictable effect.
Gamemasters are encouraged to be creative and cruel-don't kill
the character outright, but anything up to instant death is fair
game. In the case of Bubba's mis-cast fireball spell, the misfire
might set Bubba's clothes on fire, blow up any gas tank within 20
meters, summon a Force 4 fire elemental under nobody's control,
surround the ganger in a temporary halo of fire or trigger any
number of effects.
Any use of magic may cause a misfire. Misfires caused by
Conjuring Tests tend to produce uncontrolled spirits, the wrong
type of spirit, multiple spirits and manifestations of greater or lesser power than the caster intended. Some conjuring misfires have
summoned hostile and dangerous spirits of a kind that no one has
ever seen before. Enchanting Test misfires tend to create explosions, produce cursed or dangerous foci, trigger poltergeist phenomena and cause severe Drain on the spellcaster (treat as [Focus
Rating]D Drain that causes Mental damage). Sorcery Test misfires
are the most common type and may trigger virtually any kind of
magical effect.
Unlike normal failures under the Rule of One, magical misfires
cannot be prevented by using a Karma Pool Point to re-roll a
result of 1. A magician can spend I point of Good Karma to
reduce the misfire to a normal failure per the standard rules.
Variable Mana and Astral Conditions
Like the physical world, astral space is not a uniform place. It
contains "terrain" and astral conditions that vary widely from
place to place and change with time. Some conditions may
reduce the effects of magic, others may increase the effects of
magic, and still others may cause magic to consistently produce
unpredictable effects.

Background count is one condition that affects how
magic works in a specific location. Depending on the background count of an area, magic effects may be boosted or
lowered, In some instances, the background count will
affect only certain kinds of magic. (For further information
on background counts, see p. 103, Awakenings.)
Other mana and astral conditions may vary according
to time. Many magical traditions hold certain dates sacred.
During these times, magical forces may become especially
potent or weak-the background count or the rating of a
power site or ley line may drop or rise dramatically. For
example, during Halloween the barriers between the astral
and physical world grow thin. Consequently, magicians
working spells on Halloween night might find that nearly
any place where people observe the holiday becomes a
power site with a Rating of 1 or 2 (the exact rating is determined by how strongly the local inhabitants uphold the
original tradition). Typically, such effects are strongest in
areas where local inhabitants still observe the sacred times,
or where the dates have been observed for long periods of
history. Specific events might also cause a temporary background count (see p. 104, Awakenings) that fades as time
passes.
Gamemasters are encouraged to experiment with different magical conditions in different places and times
throughout their campaigns. Furthermore, magician characters may make Magic Theory and Astral Perception Tests
to learn more about local conditions before working any
magic. Gamemasters set test target numbers, based on the
character's background and the local conditions.
Mana Surges
Mana surges are like "storms" in astral space. These
violent disturbances are rarer and infinitely more volatile
than place- or time-based mana and astral variations, and
they can cause the effects of magic to shift unpredictably. Mana
surges seem to occur under certain rare conditions such as astrological conjunctions, but so far no one has created a reliable system for predicting the formations, locations or intensities of mana
surges.
A mana surge may affect an area ranging in size from a singie city block to an entire country. Surges can last anywhere from
a few minutes to a several weeks. No recorded mana surge has
ever lasted longer than a lunar month (28 days). Individual
gamemasters determine the affected areas and duration of mana
surges in their campaigns.
During a surge, any magic cast in the area becomes difficult
to control and results become unpredictable. In game terms, a
surge may affect magic in two basic ways: It may cause a change
in a spell's Force Rating and/or Drain Level or a change in the
Force Rating of a summoned spirit.
Spell Casting Effects: The gamemaster can simply choose an
effect appropriate to his campaign or the character doing the casting, select an effect from the Mana Surge Spell Effects Table, or
determine the effect by rolling 1D6 and consulting the Mana
Surge Spell Effects Table.

Drain is staged down by 1 level
*All standard penalties for casting a spell greater than the caster's
Magic Rating apply (see p. 128, SRII).
All tests for the affected spell are made using the Force of the
spell as dictated by the two die rolls, with a minimum Force of 1.
Keep in mind that a change to the Force of a spell will also
affect its Drain. If a spell's Drain level is listed as Deadly and must
be staged up, add I to the target number for the Drain Resistance
Test, regardless of the Force of the spell. Stage Drain down as normal.
A mana surge affects all spells cast in the physical or astral
plane of the affected area, including spells cast for ritual magic. It
does not affect the use of fetishes or foci. Metamagic also remains
unaffected, as do the abilities of physical adepts.
If desired, gamemasters may declare that mana surges
increase or decrease the target numbers for ritual links.
Spirit Summoning Effects: Conjuring in an area affected by a
mana surge is risky because the spirit that responds may possess
a Force Rating higher or lower than the summoner intended. The
conjurer suffers Drain based on the Force of the spirit actually
summoned, not the spirit that the conjurer intended to summon.
The gamemaster can increase or decrease the summoned spirit's
Force using the Force Increase and Force Decrease tables for mana
surge spell effects.

A spirit with a Force Rating higher than the summoner
expected will remain to perform the requested service, but the
gamemaster should make the spirit as Insubordinate and resentful as possible.
Unknown Magic
Magic breaks the rules-that's the one magic rule that
gamemasters should always keep in mind. The standard
Shadowrun magic rules describe the magic that player characters
are able to use and control -- the fairly commonplace and wellunderstood aspects of the mystic arts. But there is far, far more to
magic than the people of the Sixth World have managed to learn.
Consequently, sometimes magic acts in ways that nobody
can explain, not even the best theoreticians. This gives the
gamemaster the freedom to introduce whatever wizzer new magical things he or she wants to add to his or her campaign-without having to explain their existence or the way they work to the
players. If you want to create a unique magical item that lets your
players turn a group of Aztec blood mages to stone under the
light of the full moon. that's cool. And if the players start to celebrate because they think they have a talisman they can use to turn
all of their enemies to stone, gently remind them of the dangers
of relying too heavily on unknown magical items before you let
them find out for themselves that the talisman only works against
magicians using blood magic under a full moon during the Hour
of Mictlanteculti. In fact, that particular item might never work
again. Why? Because it's magic.
By the same token, if you want some NPC to have a spell, ritual or magical item that is like nothing your player characters have
ever seen, go right ahead. The Sixth World contains plenty of people who have access to magic that others may not understand.
Some of the magical groups and entities from the Threats sourcebook, for example, have access to magic beyond most humans'
ken, and it is said that madness carries with it insights into things
that a sane person could never comprehend-so who knows what
powers an insane magician might tap?
If your players have decided that they know everything there
Is to know about how magic works, throw something at them to
remind them that magic is a mysterious, unpredictable force far
beyond their powers of comprehension.
MAINTAINING THE MYSTERY OF MAGIC
Ideally, magic should be a rare and unusual phenomenon in
the Shadowrun universe, and magically talented individuals
should be a rare breed-"a mere 1 percent of the population."
according to The Grimoire sourcebook. Yet in many Shadowrun
games, "sometimes it seems like you can't swing a dead black cat
without hitting a fraggin' magician," as the twenty-first-century
anthropologist Mullins Chadwick observes. As a result, magic
threatens to become anything but rare and unusual.
Fortunately, addressing this problem is fairly simple. First,
gamemasters must understand that limiting the amount of magic
in a campaign will make the magic that remains all the more
Impressive and unusual. Second, gamemasters must exercise a
little restraint and resist the urge to incorporate all of their favorite
magical phenomena into a single game session.
These solutions do not address the need to create magical
challenges to keep magical player characters occupied. Virtually
every shadowrunning group contains at least one magician character, and the group's opponents will need to have some mojo to
counter that character. The following section provides a few
options that gamemasters can use to reduce the amount of magic
they must introduce into a campaign to maintain game balance.
Limits
Limiting the number of player-character magicians is probably the simplest way to reduce magic use in a campaign. Limit
shadowrunning teams to one magician each, and keep all magically talented characters rare in most games.
If every player in a group wants to play a magician or adept.
run a specialized campaign specifically designed to challenge
their abilities (see Double, Double Toil and Trouble, p. 119).
Magic Resistance
Whenever possible and practical, use magic-resistant mundane opponents. The cybermantic characters described in the
Cybertechnology sourcebook are a good (but rare) example of
such opponents. Rigger-controlled drones, security 'bots, and
guards hyped up on drugs to make them resistant to mana-type
spells are other examples of potential magic-resistant mundane
opponents.
Background Count
Make careful use of background counts and aspected magic
areas (see p. 103, Awakenings). It seems highly likely that certain
corps and powerful individuals purposefully cultivate high background counts in certain sites to deter magical opponents. The
FAT bacteria mentioned in on page 82 of the Corporate Security
sourcebook is one way corps might create such background
counts, but even the daily activities of most corps can easily create low background counts.
Critters
Awakened critters are another excellent substitute for NPC
magicians. Critters such as the dzoo-no-qua, which is very resistant to magic and quite a physical threat, makes an excellent
choice for this purpose. Nimue's salamanders, which can drain or
neutralize magic, make good adversaries as well. Remember that
even the least intelligent dual critter can fight a spell cast at it in
astral combat rather than make a simple Resistance Test.
Mundane vs. Magician
Instead of creating magician NPCs to oppose player character
magicians, simply use large numbers of mundane NPCs to even
the odds. For example, there's no reason a gamemaster must create a magical opponent to keep a street mage character busy-a
dozen gangers will keep him occupied just as well.
Countering a magical player character with large numbers of
mundane NPCs can also be fun for the player character, because
he can really let loose without worrying about Spell Defenses or
magical counterattacks. Such confrontations can show just how
tough magicians on all-out offense can be.

Keep in mind that mundane opponents can be more than just
"cannon fodder" for magician player characters. Most corporate
security forces, for example, know enough about magic to limit
the magician's line of sight. And nearly every NPC on the street
NPC reacts in a fight. For example, an Inferior/Trained opponent
(Professional Rating 3) may possess lower Skill Ratings and abillties than most player characters, but she will take a lot of abuse
before giving up a fight. On the other hand, a Superior/Average
knows enough to "geek the mage
first" when the bullets and spells
start flying.
CREATING
PRIME RUNNERS
Designing non-player character opponents that are powerful
enough to genuinely threaten
player characters yet vulnerable
to defeat is one of the keys to running fun, engaging Shadowrun
games. There is no way to create
a single set of game statistics for
such NPC opponents that will
prove equally effective in all
Shadowrun games, however.
simply because the player characters in each individual game possess unique strengths and weaknesses. This section offers a
method for creating the prime
runners every shadowrunning
team faces in the course of doing
business. This system also allows
gamemasters to tailor the powers
of known runners such as
Fastjack, Hatchetman, Argent.
Magister and other published,
high-profile runners to the level of
their groups' teams, simply by
deciding how a prime runner
compares to the shadowrunners
in the group.
The system provides frameworks for creating five broad
types and ratings of NPC opponents: Inferior. Equal, Superior.
Supreme and Superhuman. The
description of each type suggests
statistic levels for the NPC that are
based on the statistics of the player characters the NPC will face. In
other words, the gamemaster will
tailor the NPC prime runners to
accommodate the relative strength of the player characters.
The description for each opponent level suggests a range of
Threat Ratings. Varying the Threat Rating of each opponent and
occasionally increasing or decreasing the Threat Rating during the
course of a campaign helps keep players guessing about the actual power of their opponents. Each NPC opponent should also possess a Professional Rating (see p. 187, SRII) to determine how the
(Professional Rating 1) opponent
may be highly skilled but will
have little stomach for battle.
The following classifications
may be useful for gamemasters
creating Enemies (see p. 71).
INFERIOR
An NPC who is rated as
Inferior to the player characters
may still be a prime runner.
Power and influence can be measured in many ways beyond
strength, intelligence, nuyen.
equipment, contacts and all the
other ways runners rank themselves against their peers. For
example, an opponent need
hold only one item of information that the players would find
inconvenient if it was revealed,
and that NPC automatically ranks
as a threat, even if that information is his or her only advantage.
Inferior NPCs possess Skill
and Attribute Ratings 1-2 points
lower than the Skill and Attribute
Ratings of the average player
character in a campaign.
Under ideal conditions, a
single player character is a match
for 2-3 Inferior NPCs. Inferior
characters may be very competent-they just aren't in the
league of the player characters.
Inferior characters have
Threat Ratings from 1-2. At an
appropriate moment during
combat, the gamemaster may
increase the NPC's Threat Rating
to 3 to represent a one-time
boost of energy (similar to a
character's use of Karma dice).
EQUAL
An NPC who is rated Equal to
the player characters possesses Skill and Attribute Ratings that are
roughly equal to the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player characters in the campaign.
These NPCs are the peers (and perhaps the rivals) of the campaign's player characters. They possess the same types of abilities
and are capable of most of the same actions as the player characters. Depending on the general skill level and competence of the
player characters, they may have many peers or very few.
Gamemasters should play Equal NPCs with Dice Pools or
Threat Ratings of 3-5, At an appropriate moment during combat,
the gamemaster may increase the NPC's Threat Rating to 6 to represent a one-time boost of energy (similar to a character's use of
Karma dice).
SUPERIOR
Superior NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 1-2 points
higher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of the player
characters in a campaign.
Superior NPCs enjoy an edge in experience, talent or just
plain luck that makes them better than their player-character
counterparts, Consequently. a single Superior character is an even
match for 2 player characters.
Gamemasters may find it more effective to use Dice Pools to
reflect the superior abilities of these NPCs. If he or she prefers to
use a Threat Rating, the Threat Rating should equal the average of
the shadowrunner teams' Dice Pools for the opponent's specialty.
For example, a Superior street samurai would have a Threat Rating
equal to the average of the Combat Pool Dice of the shadowrunner team.
Because they wield far more power than Equal or Inferior
NPCs, Superior NPCs should show up only rarely in campaigns.
SUPERHUMAN
Superhuman NPCs possess Skill and Attribute Ratings 3 or
more points higher than the average Skill and Attribute Ratings of
the player characters in a campaign. These NPCs are the best at
what they do. They are the cream of the crop, legends of the
streets, spoken of with respect and awe. These NPCs make good
foils for reminding player characters of their own mortality and
limits, or good adversaries for a group of very capable characters,
Usually. a single Superhuman NPC provides an even match
for an entire team of player characters.
The Dice Pools (and Threat Ratings: see above) of
Superhuman NPCs are 1-3 points higher than the average Dice
Pools of the player characters. Add the Threat Rating to all tests
the NPC makes.
ULTIMATE
The powers of Ultimate NPC opponents are off the scale.
These opponents include great dragons, powerful spirits, ancient
immortals, godlike Als and other entities that are so powerful they
don't need game statistics. Gamemasters simply determine their
exact powers to suit the current campaign and set an appropriate
measurement to describe their characteristics as needed.
Because Ultimate NPCs are so powerful, they function more
like plot devices than standard NPC characters. Player characters
might be able to thwart some of the plans and schemes of an
Ultimate NPC, but no mortal has a prayer of surviving a direct confrontation with an Ultimate opponent.
Use Ultimate NPC opponents very sparingly. They really
don't need Dice Pools or Threat Ratings, Just keep rolling until
they succeed-that's one of the reasons they are called Ultimate.
STATE OF THE ART
The state-of-the-art (SOTA) rules provide game mechanics for
simulating the steady advance of technology, the costs of keeping
up with the latest technology and the disadvantages of not keeping up with technological innovations. In addition to helping the
gamemaster convey the unstoppable rush of technological
improvement that is an essential part of Shadowrun, the SOTA
system provides a convenient way to reduce the amounts of
nuyen and Good Karma characters possess and reduce overly
powerful characters' skill and equipment ratings/bonuses.
While SOTA rules also apply to NPCs, gamemasters need not
manage the details of every gamemaster character's relationship
to the SOTA. He or she should simply keep in mind that the runners' opposition may also occasionally struggle to maintain the
cutting edge and take care to not assume that all NPCs come
equipped with the latest innovations and most recent discoveries
in every field.
The Virtual Realities 2.0 sourcebook provides SOTA rules for
deckers. The following SOTA rules apply to other areas of the
Shadowrun universe. General rules regarding the use of SOTA are
followed by rules for determining the field of SOTA advancement
and specific rules for the effects of advancement in each field.
Gamemasters can advance the SOTA in their campaigns after each
adventure, once per game-year, or at any interval in between.
LIFESTYLE COST REDUCTIONS
To reflect the greater opportunities and advantages enjoyed
by successful characters, any character who maintains a Luxury or
High lifestyle receives an automatic SOTA cost reduction. A character with a Luxury lifestyle may reduce the final nuyen cost of a
SOTA advance by 25 percent. A character with a High lifestyle
may reduce the final nuyen cost of a SOTA advance by 10 percent.
CYBERWARE COSTS
The advent of beta and delta-grade cyberware has made
alpha-grade cyberware far more available-but certainly not
cheaper. To reflect this change, the Street Index and Availability
for alpha-grade cyberware is now the same as for standard-grade
cyberware. This means that players may choose alpha-grade
cyberware for their characters during character creation, Because
neither the Essence nor nuyen cost changed, however, the player
must now decide whether to pay extra nuyen for the higher-grade
cyberware, or to save on the Essence cost. (See the Street
Samural Catalog and Cybertechnology for rules and costs of
alpha-grade cyberware.)
Alpha and standard-grade cyberware is subject to the SOTA
costs described in the various fields of SOTA advancement. Beta
and delta-grade cyberware is immune to the SOTA-for now.
Characters who use cheap or second-hand cyberware must
increase the SOTA cost by 20 percent.
FALLING BEHIND THE SOTA CURVE
Any character who fails to pay the SOTA Factor cost of a
SOTA advance suffers the penalties described. The character may
reverse these penalties by paying the appropriate SOTA Factor
cost any time before the next SOTA advancement in that field.

If a character fails to pay the SOTA Factor cost for two consecutive SOTA advances in a field, she "falls behind the SOTA
curve" and cannot reverse the penalty by simply paying the
required costs. In addition to paying the required costs, the character must retrain in the affected field to regain the lost skill levels. Such training is subject to all the basic rules for skill upgrades
and any rules the gamemaster wishes to apply from the Optional
Training Rules section (p. 50).
DETERMINING THE FIELD OF SOTA ADVANCEMENT
To determine the field of SOTA advancement, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 and consults the SOTA Table. The SOTA
Advancements section describes the effects of the advancing
state of the art in each field, the resulting SOTA Factor, and the
penalties a character suffers if he
does not pay the SOTA Factor.
In addition to choosing the
frequency of SOTA advances,
gamemasters should customize
the tables, adjust dice roll
results, or otherwise alter the
effects of SOTA advancements
to better fit their own
Shadowrun campaigns.
SOTA ADVANCEMENTS
Biotechnology
SOTA advances in this field
represent
innovations
in
biotechnology and medical
treatments designed to address
the injuries and illnesses related
to the ever-increasing amounts
of new drugs, cyberware and
biotech on the streets.
Consequently, a character who
does not keep up with biotechnology advancements will find it
increasingly difficult to effectively treat injuries and diagnose disorders.
The SOTA Factor for biotechnology advancements is equal to
twice a character's original Biotech Skill Rating or twice the rating
of his highest Biotech Concentration or Specialization, whichever
is higher. Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 500 nuyen. (This
means that when your medkit goes out-of-date, it's cheaper to
buy a new one.) Characters may spend Good Karma to reduce this
cost: each Karma Point spent reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point.
(Biotechnology SOTA advances do not affect DocWagon contracts. Assume that DocWagon personnel automatically keep up
with the SOTA.)
If a character does not pay the SOTA Factor, reduce by 1 point
all of his Biotech Skill Ratings, including ratings for Biotech
Concentrations or Specializations. The ratings of the character's
Biotech expert systems, medkits and such are reduced by 1 point
as well.

*Gamemasters who prefer to calculate Matrix SOTA
advances separate from the general SOTA system
can simply replace the Matrix entry on the table
with a second Vehicles/Rigger Technology entry.
Vehicles/Rigger Technology
New cars with new gear have just hit the showroom floors
(and the streets, of course). The gamemaster chooses which area
of the field improves, the vehicle or the rigger gear.
The SOTA Factor for a vehicle SOTA advancement is equal to
twice the original rating of the improved piece of equipment.
Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 1,000 nuyen. Characters can
spend Good Karma to reduce the cost; each Karma Point spent
reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point.
If a character does not pay the SOTA Factor for an affected
vehicle, reduce by 1 point one of the following ratings: Handling,
Body, Armor or Pilot.
At the gamemaster's discretion, a vehicles/rigger technology SOTA advancement may occur in the area of vehicle-control
rigs (VCRs) or rigger remote decks.
The SOTA Factor for such advances is
equal to 10 times the initial Reaction
bonus provided by the cyberware (for
example, 10 points for Level | VCRs
and remote decks, 20 points for Level
2 items, and so on). Each SOTA point
costs 1.000 nuyen. Characters can
reduce the cost by spending Good
Karma. Each Karma Point spent
reduces the cost by 500 nuyen.
Characters that fail to pay these
SOTA costs lose 1 point of the
Reaction bonus provided by the vehicle-control rig or remote deck.
Matrix
For rules on SOTA advances in
cyberdecks, programs and other
Matrix technology, see the Optional
Rule: SOTA on page 78 of the Virtual
Realities 2.0 sourcebook.
Personal Armor
Yet another new method for making cheap armor-piercing
ammunition has hit the streets.
The SOTA Factor for this advance is equal to the Ballistic
Armor Rating of each piece of armor a character owns. Each SOTA
Factor point costs 500 nuyen. (Generally, this cost makes replacement much more cost-effective than upgrading, except for heavy
combat armor.)
Reduce by | point the Ballistic Armor Rating of all personal
armor owned by a character who does not pay the SOTA cost.
NERPS
A SOTA advance in NERPS represents a new popular culture
fad-anything from the new single by your favorite troll thrash
band the Horns of Plenty to the new moving sidewalks in the
Renraku Arcology.
These advancements have no game effect.

Reaction-Enhancing Cyberware
Reaction-enhancing cyberware SOTA advances represent
innovations in wired reflexes and other reaction-enhancing cyberware.
The SOTA Factor for such advancements is equal to 10 times
the initial Reaction bonus provided by the cyberware ( 20 points
for Wired Reflexes (1), 40 points for Wired Reflexes (2), and so
on). Each SOTA Factor point costs 1,000 nuyen. Characters can
reduce the cost by spending Good Karma: each Karma Point
spent reduces the cost by 5,000 nuyen.
Double all SOTA costs for boosted reflexes; these systems
can be tweaked but never properly upgraded.
For characters who fail to pay the SOTA cost, reduce by 1
point the Reaction bonus provided by the affected cyberware.
(For rules on VCRs and remote decks, see Vehicles/Rigger
Technology, p. 86).
ECM/ECCM
The gamemaster can treat ECM (Electronic Countermeasures)
and ECCM (Electronic Counter-Countermeasures) advancements
as separate events or assume that any ECM improvement is automatically followed by a corresponding ECCM advancement.
For ECM SOTA advancements, the SOTA Factor is equal to 10
times the affected device's current rating. Each SOTA Factor point
costs 1 percent of the device's initial cost. For example, a Rating
6 maglock passkey would have a SOTA Factor of 60: the cost to
keep it up-to-date would be 60 percent of its Initial 60,000-nuyen
cost, or 36,000 nuyen.
For characters who do not pay the SOTA cost, reduce by 1 the
rating of any affected maglock key or electronic surveillance
device (dataline taps, codebreakers, Scramble-breakers, signal
locators, and so on). Similarly, reduce by 1 the ECM rating of any
affected vehicle or equipment.
For ECCM SOTA advancements, the SOTA Factor is equal to
10 times the affected device's current rating. Each SOTA Factor
point costs 1 percent of the device's initial cost.
For characters who do not pay the SOTA cost, reduce by | the
rating of any affected maglock and electronic surveillance countermeasure (bug scanners, Crypto Circuits, data-encryption systems. and so on). Similarly, reduce by 1 the ECCM rating of any
affected vehicle or piece of equipment.
Electronics
Electronics SOTA advances represent breakthroughs in circuit
design or other innovations in electronics technology.
The SOTA Factor for such advances is equal to twice a character's Electronics Skill Rating or twice the rating of the character's
highest Electronics Concentration or Specialization, whichever is
higher. Each point of the SOTA Factor costs 500 nuyen. Characters
can spend Good Karma to defray this cost; each Karma Point
spent reduces the SOTA Factor by 1 point.
Reduce by 1 point the Electronics Skill Rating of any character who fails to pay the SOTA cost.
Magical Theory/Practice
Magical theory SOTA advances represent new magical
research findings that substantially revise magical theory.
The SOTA Factor of such advances is equal to twice a character's Magical Theory Skill Rating or the rating of his highest
Magical Theory Concentration or Specialization, whichever is
higher. Each SOTA Factor point costs 500 nuyen. Characters may
spend Good Karma to reduce this cost. For each Karma Point
spent, reduce the SOTA Factor by 1 point.
Reduce by 1 point the Magical Theory Skill Rating of any character who fails to pay the cost.
The SOTA Factor for a Hermetic Library is equal to twice the
library's rating. For disk-based libraries, each SOTA Factor point
costs 100 nuyen. For chip-based libraries, each point costs 120
nuyen, for hard-copy libraries, 200 nuyen.
Reduce by 1 point the rating of a Hermetic Library of any
character who fails to pay the SOTA cost.
ROLEPLAYING THE SOTA
The SOTA system also provides new roleplaying opportunities.
For starters, gamemasters can inform players of a new SOTA
advance in several ways-talk on Shadowland, a chance meeting
with a contact who gives them the latest buzz, an eye-opening
fight with a razorboy equipped with the new SOTA wired reflexes, and so on.
Next, gamemasters can require that player characters do
more than simply spend some nuyen to keep up with SOTA
advances. Tracking down a new piece of hardware, finding someone who can teach the latest skill advances, or scamming a copy
of the newest cutting-edge software are just a few examples of
tasks that characters might have to perform to keep up.
Additionally, gamemasters can consider SOTA Factor costs part of
the resources-time, information, tools, equipment and so oncharacters must spend to keep up with a SOTA advancement.
DEAD-END TECH OPTION
The dead-end tech option provides a way for particularly
cold-hearted gamemasters to inflict additional SOTA penalties on
player characters.
Under the dead-end tech option, the gamemaster can decide
that characters must select between two or more upgrade options
to keep up with a particular SOTA advance. (These competing
upgrade options represent competing product lines manufactured by rival corporations.) At the gamemaster's discretion, any
time a SOTA advance occurs in that field, one of the competing
product lines may collapse. Characters who used the defunct
product line must then pay double the standard SOTA Factor cost
to maintain their ratings-which means re-training and big nuyen.
RETIREMENT
Most runners don't retire until shortly after they die.
However, the lucky few who retire before they meet an unfortunate end will likely have contacts, skills and resources that make
them valuable to the shadowrunning community.

Characters may retire for many reasons. Perhaps the player is
simply tired of playing that character: maybe the gamemaster
decides that a character has become too powerful or will not be
able to play a useful role in the current campaign: perhaps the
gamemaster and player initially agreed that the character would
die at the end of a specific story line, but at the moment of truth
neither really wants to let the character disappear from the game
completely. In this case, the player may agree to hand over control of the character to the gamemaster, and the character may
take on a completely new life as a friend or foe of the shadowrunner team.
Depending on the circumstances of their leaving the team,
ex-runners may stand willing and ready to help their former teammates whenever and in whatever way is needed at a moments'
notice. As a fixer or a Mr. johnson, the character may serve as the
team's primary resource for work, or may simply be a constant,
inexpensive source of information and contacts. A character who
chooses not to pursue a second career and decides to simply live
on his or her savings may be persuaded to come out of retirement
for "one more big score" or to get his old team out of a jam, especially if the team made very powerful enemies before the player
character left ("Remember that comm line we tapped back in '55?
Unfortunately for us, it turns out that that was Lofwyr's private
LTG. He'd like us to come to a meet and discuss the consequences of our actions ... . ").
On the other hand, they may actively seek to aid the team's
enemies and bring down their former chummers. An ex-runner
may have been an agent of a team's enemy working from the
inside, or some sort of misunderstanding might have turned the
character against the team, leaving him or her ripe for recruitment
by the enemy. In the best tradition of the spy genre (and
Shadowrun, for that matter), gamemasters may spin a complex
web of deceit, betrayal, double- or triple-crosses, regret and
revenge that keeps the former player character involved in the
campaign in newly sinister and morally complicated ways.
Retired runners can remain active in a campaign in several
ways. Some may simply step back from the front lines and operate behind the scenes in relative safety. Others may come out of
the shadows completely and put their experience to work in the
civilian or corporate worlds. The following section offers some
ideas for roles that retired runners can play in a campaign.
Regardless of the role a retired character assumes, all retired
characters act as Level 3 contacts for their former teammates.
Additionally, an ex-runner's contacts can serve as friends-of-afriend for all team members. (See Friends of a Friend, p. 63, for
more information about FOFs).
SECOND CAREERS
Ex-shadowrunners often have a wide variety of skills that
enable them to earn a living in numerous ways. Some of the less
traditional choices for a second career include: urban brawl player
or combat-biker, Matrix consultant, Doc Wagon employee, magical researcher, street doc, military advisor, talismonger, corporate
wage slave and simsense star (an ever-popular choice).
Ex-runners may also choose second careers more closely
related to the work they did as shadowrunners.
"Hello. I'm Mr. Johnson."
Usually, former shadowrunners are well-suited to act as "Mr.
Johnsons." Typically, a former runner is intimately familiar with
how a shadowrun is orchestrated, which can give such a character valuable insight into the potential risks and profits of a run. Exrunners are also likely to know at least some of the shadowrunners
operating in an area and be better able to pick the right people for
a job. But perhaps most important, most shadowrunners will be
more likely to trust an ex-runner rather than a Johnson who has
spent his career behind a desk.
The same characteristics also make ex-runners well-suited to
act as "talent agents" for shadowrunning teams. A character serving as an agent actively searches out the most lucrative jobs for
her team and takes a percentage of the profits in return.
If an ex-runner character doesn't have a total of 6 contacts,
the gamemaster and former controlling player can select additional contacts to bring the number to 6.
"I Got What You're Looking For"
Any runner character who retires with some money may set
himself up as a fixer. A former shadowrunner would likely have
the contacts needed to obtain hard-to-find pieces of equipment
and to fence the kind of drek-hot paydata and trinkets that runners
tend to collect. Furthermore, most retired runners have dealt with
fixers often and are fairly familiar with that aspect of the business.
As a sideline, many fixers also arrange runners for independent shadowruns or act as intermediaries between corporations
and runners. Such activities are practically required for fixers who
deal primarily in information.
Any former runner who sets up shop as a fixer may select
contacts to bring his total number of contacts to 6. Fixers tend to
specialize, so players may wish to select contacts that reflect the
character's specialty.
"I Know How These Scum Operate"
Sometimes it takes a rat to catch a rat. Corporations recognize this fact, and often hire former shadowrunners to work as corporate security specialists, trainers, guards, security deckers and
so on. Some ex-runners even set up their own private security
consulting firms and sell their services to the corporations they
used to run against.
"Hey, I'm Clean"
Any ex-runner who retires with a bit of cash can set up a
"legitimate" business. (Some characters may even open a shop
before they retire, though this involves a much greater risk in the
event that their cover is blown.) Every legal business owner must
have a SIN (even if it's just a counterfeit one), as well as the proper permits and registrations. Some popular businesses for exshadowrunners include weapons stores (for former street sams
and mercs), talismonger shops (for former magicians), electronics/computer stores (for ex-deckers) and vehicle repair (for former
riggers).
Opening any business requires an initial investment. The
entrepreneur must buy base inventory and purchase or lease any
required facilities, For most businesses, these costs can be determined by using the equipment and working gear costs listed in
the gear tables at the end of SRII. Keep in mind that a character
making legal purchases need not worry about the Street Index of
legal items, facilities or shops.
Business and operating permits can cost anywhere from 100
to 1,000 nuyen or more, depending on the type of business-for
example, a permit for a registered security agency will cost considerably more than a permit for a talismonger shop or a courier
business. Individual gamemasters may set permit costs in their
campaigns.
Finally, keep in mind that a "legitimate" business owner need
not restrict herself to legal means to operate her business. "Hot"
merchandise and alternative funding sources (loan sharks, bank
heists and so on) are just two shady practices that may spell
Instant success (or eventual ruin) for a would-be business owner.
DEFECTING TEAM MEMBERS
According to the standard rules, a group's Team Karma Pool
is reduced by half whenever a character leaves a group (see p.
191. SRII). Consequently, team members may put pressure on
their fellow player characters to remain on their team, and players
may be reluctant to stop playing their characters for fear of putting
the remaining team members at a severe disadvantage.
To lessen these pressures and make retirement a more desirable option for player characters, gamemasters may waive this
Team Karma penalty when a character leaves a group on good
terms. Instead, divide the total Team Karma Pool by the number
of team members (round up) to determine each member's
"share" of the Team Karma Pool. When a player leaves, simply
reduce the Team Karma Pool by his share. The defecting player
does not receive the Karma Points-they are simply gone.
If a player leaves a team on bad or indifferent terms, reduce
the Team Karma Pool by half, per standard rules.
If a character ever wishes to return to a former team, he must
contribute Karma to the Team Karma Pool according to the standard rules for a new member of the group before he can use that
Karma Pool.
INTEGRATING NEW TEAM MEMBERS
Few gaming groups are willing to start a new campaign just
to add a new player or player character. Every time a new player
wants to join the game, however, or a new player character needs
to join the team because a former character retired or died or
because the team is lacking a necessary skill, the group must find
a way to successfully integrate new characters into the existing
shadowrunning team.
Using the team's contacts is perhaps the simplest way to
introduce new characters to a group. A contact may Introduce a
new character at virtually any time and place.
Following the contact's introduction of a new character or in
place of it, a team might hold a "trial run" to test prospective team
members. Gamemasters can easily fill such runs with interesting
and fun surprises, because the prospective member and the team
will be unfamiliar with each other's skills, abilities, work methods,
personalities and so on.

Finally, a chance encounter may
bring a new character and a group
together. Gamemasters can use nearly
any element already present in their
campaigns-Edges and Flaws, training. background stories, common
enemies-to get a new player onto an
existing shadowrunning team.
OPTIONAL RULES
The following rules offer options
for certain facets of the game that
many players already tweak using
house rules. As with all the rules and
systems in this book, players and
gamemasters should agree on which
optional rules will be incorporated
into their game before using any
optional rules.
AVAILABILITY
According to the standard rules,
players may not purchase any gear for
their characters during character creation that has a Rating higher
than 6. While this effectively serves to prevent characters from
beginning the game with high-end government- and corporatelevel gear, it fails to account for the fact that certain legally available items are also very difficult to obtain. To reflect the concept
of limited-edition or hard-to-get items (and to keep characters a
little less powerful at character creation), use the following rule.
No character may start the game with a piece of gear with an
Availability of greater than 6. (Think of it in terms of a Ferrari
Testarossa. You may have seen one on TV, and if you live in a large
city you actually may have seen one on the street or at an auto
show. But owning one is out of the question-heck, you might
even have to do research to find out where to buy one.) The
gamemaster must use this rule if he or she is using the State-ofthe-Art Model Edge. p. 34.
FACEDOWN TESTS
Occasionally. a character will try to make an opponent back
down from a confrontation on the strength of his presence and
reputation alone.
Facing down an opponent in this manner requires a successful Facedown Test. For the test, a character can use his Willpower
or Charisma Attribute (whichever is higher) plus a number of dice
equal to his Karma Pool (NPCs use a number of dice equal to their
Threat Ratings). Karma Points are not actually spent for the testthe Karma Pool is simply used as a measure of the character's reputation. The Facedown Test target number equals the opponent's
Willpower.
In turn. the target of the facedown makes an opposing
Willpower Test to resist. The test target number equals the rating
of the Attribute the character is using for his or her test.
The character who scores the most successes wins the test
and forces his opponent to back down.

INTIMIDATION CONCENTRATION
Sometimes it's not how you say it-it's how LOUD you say it.
Intimidation, a new Concentration of the Negotiation Skill,
represents this principle. By making a successful Intimidation
Test(s), a character can make a subject answer questions he
wouldn't answer otherwise or give in to other demands.
The Intimidation Test Modifiers Table provides target modifiers for Intimidation Tests. (The modifiers may also be used for any
tests of Negotiation or its Concentrations, including Interrogation.)
If desired, gamemasters may allow subjects of intimidation
attempts to make opposing Willpower Tests to resist. Such a test
uses a target number equal to the Skill Rating of the intimidator.
If the intimidator generates more successes, the subject spills
the proverbial beans. Gamemasters can use the Contact Knowledge
Table (p. 69) to determine how much a subject knows and reveals.
If appropriate, the subject does the intimidator's bidding.
If the target of the intimidation generates more successes, he
resists attempts to coerce him and does not reveal information. In
fact, the subject may deliberately feed his would-be intimidator
false information to set up his tormentor.
Individual gamemasters can allow roleplaying to dictate the
exact details of an intimidation attempt or interrogation. Such
interactions have no time limits; a gamemaster can decide that a
single opposed Intimidation Test will decide the outcome of a
interrogation session or instruct players to make tests for every
question or at specific time intervals.
Specializations of Intimidation include Browbeating, Death
Threats, Business Ruining, Threatening Family, and Long-Term
Hassle.

PERCEPTION AND STEALTH
Very often, a shadowrunner's best course of action is to
remain undetected. However, anyone listening or watching for a
runner need only make a successful Perception (4) Test to notice
someone sneaking around (see p. 185, SRII). Even though different conditions add target modifiers to the Perception Test, it generally remains a fairly easy task.
To make sneaking about a bit easier, gamemasters may allow
characters to make opposing Stealth (4) Tests whenever someone
attempts to detect them. Every success generated on the Stealth
Test increases the Perception Test target number by 1.
Gamemasters may also apply target modifiers to the Stealth Test
to reflect any conditions that affect the character's ability to
remain concealed, such as running, wounds and moving over broken glass.
Gamemasters determine when opposing Stealth Tests are
appropriate. Note that the Stealth Skill does not make characters
invisible. If a character is walking through the middle of an empty
room, even 10 successes on a Stealth Test should not hide him
from a guard who's looking for him.
COMBAT
Deadlier Over-Damage
Under the standard rules, killing a character (especially a character with a high Body Attribute) with a single shot takes a lot of
doing. In fact, it's nearly impossible. Indeed, the standard rules
make it possible for a troll to survive for more than an hour even
after taking a shot from a Panther assault cannon square in the
head!
Ideally, this rule prevents characters from certain death as a
result of single, unexpected attacks and thus improves game play.
But as the example of the troll shows, it also can create some
ridiculous situations. To remedy this problem, gamemasters can
apply the Deadlier Over-Damage rule (based on the over-damage
rule from p. 79. Fields of Fire).
Under the Deadlier Over-Damage rule, over-damage applies
whenever the Power of an attack is greater than the target's Body
multiplied by 1.5. (For an even deadlier game, apply over-damage
whenever the Power of an attack is greater than the target's
Body.)
Over-damage is simply damage created by extra successes
after a weapon's Damage Level has been staged up to "D." Every
2 extra successes translate into 1 additional Damage Point, which
is applied against the target's Physical Condition Monitor (if the
attack caused Deadly Stun damage) or Body Overflow (if the
attack caused Deadly Physical damage).
Fatigue
No one can run forever-figuratively or literally. The big bad
megacorp will eventually track down the shadowrunner who
extracted its most valuable exec, and after a period of sprinting
even the most conditioned athlete begins to slow down. The
Fatigue rule simulates the latter phenomenon.
Under the Fatigue rule, a character can sprint for a number of
turns equal to half her Body (rounding up) before she begins to
lose steam. If the character continues to run beyond this base period, she begins taking Fatigue damage. The base damage is 4L
(Stun), and can be staged down with an Athletics Test or an
Athletics (Running) Test. (If a character is not sprinting, but is
merely running or jogging, the gamemaster may increase the
base period.)
Each time the character repeats the Skill Test (successfully or
not) she can run for an additional number of turns equal to half her
Body, suffering Fatigue damage at the end of each base period.
The character may attempt to stage down the Fatigue damage
using an Athletics Test or an Athletics (Running) Test, but the
Power of the Fatigue damage doubles for each subsequent test.
For example, if a character has a Body of 4, he may sprint for 2
turns, then must take 4L damage or make a successful Athletics
Test or Athletics (Running) Test to stage down the damage. He
can then sprint for another 2 turns, then must take 8L damage or
make a successful Athletics Test or Athletics (Running) Test to
stage down the damage.
Eventually, the runner will take enough Stun damage to convince her to stop running, or she will reach Deadly on the Stun
Condition Monitor and will collapse from exhaustion. A character
who collapses from exhaustion is not unconscious-she is simply
unable to continue any sort of strenuous activity.
Generally, Fatigue damage has the same game effects as Stun
damage. However, Fatigue damage reflects exhaustion and
aching muscles more than actual injury, and so it does not contribute to a character falling unconsciousness due to other Stun
damage and/or to a character's death from accumulated damage.
Characters may heal Fatigue damage as if it were standard Stun
damage.
Grenade/Explosives Damage
Under standard rules, the destructive force of grenades and
other explosives is dependent on the Throwing or Demolitions
Skill of the attacking character. This arrangement reflects the fact
that a better throw or cleaner detonation will improve the destructive force of an explosion.
Under the optional grenade/explosives damage rule, the
gamemaster uses the Power of a grenade/explosive to stage the
damage it causes. In other words, the gamemaster rolls a number of dice equal to half the grenade/explosive's Power (round
up) against a Target Number 4. Then, the gamemaster uses the
successes from this test to stage up the grenade/explosive's
Damage Level.
This rule can be especially useful when determining the
effects of exploding grenades set as booby traps.
Fenris has left 6 kilos of C-6 plastic explosive
laying around (careless of him, isn't it?). Fenris's
chummer, O. B. Stein, is standing a few feet away
from the C-6 when it unexpectedly detonates.
Using the formula for determining the Damage
of explosives (p. 242, SRII), the gamemaster determines that the C-6's Power is 15 and its Damage
Level is Deadly. (Because Fenris did not detonate the
C-6 intentionally, the gamemaster decides that

BASES 96.
Fenris's Demolitions Skill does not affect the C-6's
Power.)
To determine the final damage that O. B. suffers.
the gamemaster rolls 8 dice (half the C-6 Power.
rounded up) against a Target Number 4. The roll generates 4 successes. The C-6's original Damage Level
was Deadly, so these successes add 2 points of overdamage (see Deadlier Over-Damage).
Unsurprisingly. O. B. generates no successes on
his Damage Resistance Test, and he dies instantly.
Movement Option
Under the standard movement rules, during a Combat Phase
a character can run a number of meters equal to his Quickness
Rating multiplied by his running modifier (p. 83, SRII). This is an
adequate, but sometimes too imprecise, measure of how far a
character can move and how quickly. Some gamemasters and
players want a more rigorous breakdown in order to determine
exactly what is happening during each moment of a turn, especially during combat, when each movement may have repercussions based on the timing of events.
To use the movement option, players calculate a character's
running movement during a Combat Phase according to the standard rules, then divide the result by 10 (rounding up). This allows
the player and gamemaster to determine exactly how far the character can move during each moment of the Combat Phase, from
the highest Initiative to the end of the initial set of actions. For
example, if a player character has a running movement of 18, he
may move 2 meters (18 + 10 = 1.8 rounded up to 2) during each
division of time between actions in a Combat Phase. In other
words. if the character has an Initiative of 20, he may take his
action at Initiative 20, then move 2 meters on Initiative 19. 18. 17
and so on. At Initiative 10, the character may take another action,
and move 2 meters on Initiative 9, 8, 7. 6 and so on.
This level of micro-management requires a substantial
amount of bookkeeping and will not suit every group's style of
play, but it may keep a character alive if his movement allows him
to reach cover before his opponent's Initiative to fire.
Reach Bonus
When using the Reach bonus rule, calculate the difference
between the Reach Ratings of opponents.
Apply the difference as a negative target modifier to the
attack tests of the opponent with the higher (longer) Reach. For
example, an opponent with a sword (Reach I) would apply a -1
target modifier to his attack tests against an unarmed opponent.
Unlike the standard Reach rule, the Reach bonus provides no
target modifier for the opponent with the lower Reach Rating.
MAGIC
Exclusive-Sustained Spell
The exclusive-sustained spell rule enables a magician to take
Free Actions while sustaining a spell, without incurring the standard +2 modifier for sustaining a spell. If he chooses to use this
rule, a magician may take no other magical actions while the
exclusive-sustained spell is In effect, and make take only | Free
Action per turn. If the magician performs more than 1 Free Action
per turn, he must apply the standard +2 modifier to all tests for
those actions.
The exclusive-sustained spell rule can be quite useful when
sustaining spells such as Barrier and Shapechange.
Spirit Combat
If gamemasters feel that their player characters are defeating
manifest spirits too easily. they may give all manifest spirits the
paranormal animal power of Immunity to Normal Weapons.

H
Shadowrun gamemaster acts as referee, host, actor, director and storyteller-all at the
same time. Consequently, becoming a skilled gamemaster takes experience and practice.
This section provides ideas and guidelines to help gamemasters develop their skills. Much
of the information applies to gamemastering any roleplaying game, and some information
applies to running Shadowrun in particular.
Gamemastering can be one of the most enjoyable aspects of playing roleplaying
games, and everyone should try it at least once-if only to gain a better appreciation of
the work that their gamemaster puts in! If you're a gamemaster, encourage your players
to try their hand at gamemastering. If you're a player, give gamemastering a try-you
might like it.
THE ROLE OF THE GAMEMASTER
The gamemaster's job is to oversee a game or campaign-in other worlds, to get the ball rolling
and then keep it moving along. The gamemaster must act as moderator and guide. He or she is the
final authority on rules in his or her game, and he or she must provide all of the "extras" in a game
or campaign. The gamemaster must keep the game together and on track. Players often get caught
up in the roles of their characters and may forget where the story is supposed to be going. The
gamemaster must keep an eye on the progress of the story and give things a little nudge when
needed to keep the story moving and fun for everyone.
Though gamemasters wield enormous power in their games, gamemasters are not gods
(despite what some of them may believel). No gamemaster can create a truly interesting game without the cooperation of his or her players. The gamemaster's job is not to lord his or her power over
the players and put them in situations where they have no chance of succeeding. The gamemaster's
job is to work with the players to create the most satisfying game play for everyone.

The secret of successful gamemastering is actually quite simple-keep the game fun for everyone involved. Everything else is
secondary. The best gamemasters have fun while gamemastering
and do their best to make sure their players enjoy themselves,
too. Rules and systems and such are intended to help create fun
and satisfying games-they are not ends in themselves. Don't get
so caught up in game mechanics that you lose sight of the most
Important goal-having fun.
BREAKING THE RULES
If you played cops and robbers as a kid, you probably remember playing pretend as a lot of fun, just like roleplaying. You're also
likely to recall at least one argument along the lines of "I shot you!"
"Did not, you missed!" "No I didn't!" and on and on. Roleplaying
games are just a more sophisticated versions of cops and robbersthe main difference is that roleplaying games provide rules to help
determine whether or not your shot really did hit.
All roleplaying rules are simply guidelines to help reduce
arguments over what really happened during a game. They help
us to visualize and experience events in the story as they unfold.
But sometimes the rules can trigger arguments, hinder creative
players and gamemasters, and otherwise get in the way of everyone's enjoyment of the game.
That's when gamemasters need to fall back on the old adage,
"rules are made to be broken." Slavish devotion to the rules of the
game is not always the best way to have fun. If a particular rule
doesn't work for a particular scene or action, feel free to ignore or
modify it. Many groups even develop "house rules" over time, rules
that are uniquely tailored to the group's needs and style of play.
Stay flexible about the rules-they are designed to serve the
game, not the other way around.
KEYS TO GAMEMASTERING SUCCESS
No matter what type of game or campaign you run or want
to run, the following rules of thumb can help you create the best
game/campaign possible.
BE INFORMED!
Even the simplest, most straightforward game contains plenty of things the gamemaster must monitor. Players need only keep
track of a single character, but the gamemaster must keep track of
all of the player characters, as well as non-player characters
(NPCs), the major events of the campaign, the flow of the adventure and all of the other little details that make the game world
come alive for the players. Consequently, every gamemaster
should strive to be informed at all times.
Organizing all of your information for a particular game-and
keeping it organized throughout the game-is probably the most
important step for keeping track of everything. Maintain a running
list of the major characters and a few notes about each character's
appearance and personality, as well as a list of the major events in
the adventure. For some gamemasters, these lists contain enough
information to run an entire adventure. Other gamemasters may
want to keep detailed maps, characters' statistics and other references on hand.
Creating detailed notes of the events of each game session
can help you keep the important information straight. Review
your notes at the beginning of each game session to refresh your
memory of what happened during the last session and what is
going on in the campaign. Go over your notes after each session.
clean up and expand any notes you hastily jotted down during the
game and organize your notes for the next game. A few minutes
spent reviewing and organizing your notes before and after game
sessions can help you keep on top of things.
If your group includes players who like to keep notes about
what their characters see and do, ask to read these notes at the
end of each game session. Players might note important points
that you didn't write down. Players' notes might also offer excellent insight into how your players see events in your game and
what they believe is Important-which may be different from
what you think is Important. Such information can help you keep
your campaign interesting for your players.
If you do forget some detail or get things confused. just say
"Oops!", correct the mistake as best you can and move on.
Arguing with players or forcing them to accept your word over
some small detail can quickly spoil a game session. Remember.
your main goal is having fun.
BE KNOWLEDGEABLE!
Any gamemaster should be well acquainted with the game
he or she is running. That doesn't mean that you have to be able
to quote the rules from memory. It simply means that you're at
least familiar with the game's basic rules and know where to find
explanations of other rules as needed.
Shadowrun provides many supplementary rules and rulebooks beyond the main rulebook, and nobody can be expected to
memorize them all (even we have to look things up). Focus on
learning the basic rules from the main Shadowrun rulebook and
the rules that are important to the player characters in your group.
For example, if your group contains a rigger character, you'll need
to be fairly conversant with the vehicle rules. If your group contains a decker character, learn the Matrix rules: if your group contains one or two magician characters, magic rules will be important.
Gamemaster screens and notes are two excellent ways to
keep information on often-used rules close at hand and can spare
a gamemaster from the need to search through a rulebook during
the middle of a game. The Shadowrun gamemaster screen outlines the most commonly used procedures and numbers.
Similarly, making notes about some of the other major rules likely to come up in an adventure can also save time and keep the
game moving. For example, if you know that an upcoming scene
contains an ambush, look up the Ambush rules and make some
notes you can use when the time comes.
Generally, keeping the game moving is more important than
spending a lot of game time looking up rules (unless you are just
learning the game, of course). If you don't know the answer to a
specific rules question, don't hesitate to make a decision based on
your own judgment and tell your players, "This is how we're
going to do it for now." You can look up the specific rule after the

game session and let everyone know at that time or at the start of
the next game session whether your rule will stand or how the situation will be resolved in the future.
On the other hand, no rule says you have to hurry a game. If
you have a question about an important rule, don't be afraid to
take the time to look up the rule. No gamemaster (or player) is
perfect: even the most experienced players have to look up rules
every now and then.
BE FAIR!
Too many players believe that the gamemaster is their character's enemy in a roleplaying game. Though gamemasters control non-player opponents of their players' characters, the
gamemaster and his or her players are, in fact, on the "same
side"-both should work together to create a good story.
Therefore, gamemasters always should strive to play fair when ruling for or against the players. Don't make things too easy for your
player characters, but don't needlessly penalize them, eitherespecially if their dice rolls seem to be low on a particular night.
Being consistent is probably the most important part of being
fair. If you are going to use a variant rule in your game, make sure
you apply that rule variation whenever the appropriate situation
arises. If you allow your player-characters to have a specific advantage not mentioned in the standard rules, give their enemies the
same advantage. Keep "special cases" and exceptions to a minimum. Players can become frustrated quite quickly if a gamemaster continually changes the rules or makes exceptions.
Gamemasters should take care to keep their NPCs from being
omniscient; these characters shouldn't know everything that the
gamemaster knows. Though gamemasters control NPCs, NPCs
should not act on information that would not reasonably be available to them. Avoid the temptation to use NPCs to crush a clever
plan from your players simply because they came up with something you did not think of in advance.
BE REALISTIC!
Or more precisely, strive for verisimilitude-the appearance
of reality-in your games. Granted, a world that contains troll
gangsters and corporate dragons can hardly be called "realistic."
but all Shadowrun products are designed to create a fictional
world with the complexity of real life, and such complexity makes
for more interesting games.
NPCs are a great place to start fleshing out your campaign
world. Give your NPCs personalities, give them motives and
desires that drive them-even if those motives are unfathomable
to your player characters. Give your NPCs personality quirks, likes
and dislikes just like anyone else. Perhaps your heartless corporate
Johnson who uses shadowrun teams and tosses them away like
snot-soaked tissue has a soft spot for kids because he grew up as
an orphan on the hard streets. Maybe the toxic shaman in your
adventure has a grudge against a particular person or corporation
rather than simply hating all of humanity. Even faceless corporate
guards have lives, friends and families. Having a helpless corporate guard beg for his life while showing the runners a hologram
of his three-year-old daughter might move even hardened player-characters to mercy.
NPCs with personalities add realism to a game, and their actions
can be more unpredictable than one-dimensional "bad guys" who
only want to kill the player characters or rule the world. If desired,
gamemasters can even use the character-creation system to create
non-player characters with full statistics, gear, backgrounds, Edges
and Flaws and even their own contacts and Enemies.
Finally, have your NPCs behave consistently, according to
their personalities, motives, desires and habits, If the guys at the
local Lone Star station don't usually bother the player characters,
they shouldn't start hassling the runners unless they have a particular reason to act against their usual habits.
Similarly, critters in your game should demonstrate motives.
Animals don't simply attack for no reason-they usually strike out
of hunger, pain, fear or provocation. And they don't usually fight
to the death unless they have no choice. Guard animals are
trained and placed in a specific area for a purpose, but wild animals live where they can find food and shelter-so your player
characters shouldn't run into a pack of Gabriel hounds in the
Barrens unless someone put those hounds there.
BE FLEXIBLE!
Players almost never do what you expect them to do-that's
the one sure thing that gamemasters can rely on when dealing
with players. Most players are very clever at coming up with new
and innovative ways to wreck a gamemaster's carefully laid-out
adventure plans. When that happens (and it will, sooner or later)
the gamemaster has two choices: resisting the players' direction
or going along with it.
Resisting the players' direction usually entails forcing the
players into situations they are trying their best to avoid. Players
tend to be a stubborn lot, however, and so trying to force them
into a specific direction will probably make them fight it even
harder.
Going along with the direction in which the players seem
headed is probably the better choice. That doesn't mean a
gamemaster has to give up his plans. It simply means he adjusts
his plans, allows the player characters to play out the events their
actions lead to, and gradually guides the game back to the direction he originally planned, By going in unexpected directions,
players often provide suggestions that a gamemaster can use for
future events and plot lines. Pay attention to their speculations
and ideas during the game and use them later on. Discovering
that "they were right all along" gives the players a nice ego boost.
BE TOUGH!
Providing challenges for the player characters is an important
part of any gamemaster's job. Don't give into the temptation to
make every shadowrun a cakewalk for your player characters, and
don't let them walk all over your NPCs. If the players don't work and
sweat to earn every Karma Point and every nuyen they receive,
then you're not pushing them hard enough. Shadowrun is an
adventure game and the players are the "stars" of the adventure, so
they should have to face some dangerous opponents and survive
some harrowing escapes before they achieve their goals. Challenge
your player characters in every game, and your players will enjoy
their rewards all the more because they worked for them.

The Threat Rating system is a good way to fine tune the threat
that an opponent poses to player characters (see Threat Ratings,
p. 187, SRII). At times, gamemasters may also want to change or
ignore the result of dice rolls to maintain a threat to player characters. For example, if your major NPC throws a grenade into the
midst of the player characters and rolls all Is on his Attack Test,
feel free to ignore the result rather than have the main villain blow
himself up during an early encounter.
BE KIND!
Always keep in mind that the gamemaster and the players
should work together to create an exciting story. Consequently.
gamemasters may have to "fudge" dice rolls for player characters.
For example, a gamemaster doesn't have to kill a player character
simply because the player happened to roll badly on a Resistance
Test or because an NPC got off a lucky shot. Quite frankly.
gamemasters who measure their success in terms of killed characters will quickly find themselves without a group.
Being kind also means listening to what your players want
out of the game and trying to include their interests in the story.
A gamemaster who insists on running military/special forces
adventures for a group of players who really want to explore the
metaplanes or play a gang in the Barrens is simply not doing his
or her job.
KEYS TO A GOOD ADVENTURE
Shadowrun is an adventure roleplaying game and the player characters, whether they are shadowrunners or not, take the
roles of active figures in the Sixth World. They go out and have
the kind of adventures that would make for a good action novel
or movie. (The point of roleplaying is to step outside the roles we
play in real life. There's not much point in playing a librarian, lab
technician, mechanic or retail clerk in Shadowrun.)
This section provides suggestions for creating satisfying
adventures. Each subsection-The Premise, The Goal, The
Opposition and Complications-focuses on a single component
of a well-designed adventure.
Note that Keys to a Good Adventure and the section that follows, Plotting a Shadowrun Adventure, do not present a stepby-step adventure creation system. Gamemasters and players
may create and assemble the various components of their adventures in any order they like.
THE PREMISE
The premise is the "story behind the story" of the adventure,
the basic plot that gets things going before the player characters
get involved. It describes the scale of the adventure, creates the
setting of the adventure and hints at the adventure's theme.
The scale of the adventure is the size of the story. A largescale adventure might consist of the runners taking on a worldwide-conspiracy, while a small-scale adventure might involve taking on a single individual based in one city. The scale of an adventure is Important because taking on Lofwyr and Saeder-Krupp will
be very different than taking on a mid- or small-level corp.
The setting is simply where the main action will take place.
The setting consists of one or more locations-such as Seattle, or
perhaps various locations around the world-and a milieu. The
milieu of a setting is simply the surroundings and environment.
For example, the milieu of an adventure centered around efforts
to steal or protect a new prototype cyberdeck might be filled with
deckers, techno fixers, computer designers, lots of Matrix hardware, plenty of decking and so on. The milieu of a search-and-rescue mission in Bug City might be filled with insect spirits and
shamans, ex-military personnel, loads of big guns, vicious fire
fights, narrow escapes and other action-packed events.
Once the premise has been set, an NPC may hire the players to
involve them in the story, or the players' own personal goals or contacts may prompt them to become involved on their own initiative.
Gamemasters can make adventure premises as specific or as
general as they like. For example, a gamemaster designing a specific premise may decide that a certain corporation (Corporation
A) has developed some breakthrough technology for cybereyes.
A rival corporation (Corporation B) wants to steal the research on
the new discovery so that it can complete the design and sell it
first. The runners will become involved when an NPC from
Corporation B hires the players to break into and steal the new
technology from Corporation A.
By using a general premise, a gamemaster can give players
more control over the direction of the game or campaign. For
example, a gamemaster might decide that the players' attempts
to destroy a particular corporation (preferably a corp they already
have reason to hate) will be the general premise of a campaign.
The gamemaster will have to create some events to get the players involved-perhaps the corp geeks some of their friends-and
provide the players with information about the corporation and its
major characters. From there, the players themselves are free to
decide how they go about their task: the gamemaster simply fills
in the details as events unfold.
For examples of premises and how they work within adventures, look at any Shadowrun adventure. Sourcebooks and supplements such as Bug City, Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon
provide plenty of information for creating general premises for
adventures and campaigns.
THE GOAL
Stealing some important data, staying one step ahead of the
corporate hit team-every adventure needs a goal for the player
characters. Clear-cut goals give the players something to shoot for
and help keep an adventure on track.
Gamemasters can set adventure goals themselves, let players
set goals, or work with their players when creating goals, In any
case, the adventure goal should always reflect the personalities
and personal goals of the player characters. In fact, the personal
goals of player characters are an excellent basis for the overall
premise of an adventure. In the corporate-downfall premise, for
example, each player should clearly define why his or her character wants to see the corporation destroyed. Personal vendettas, a
desire for profit, a hatred of corporations in general, a sense of
moral outrage at the corporation's activities-any of these represent valid personal goals.
Player characters' personal goals and motives provide a good
indication of what kind of actions the characters are inclined to

take. By noting these motives, the gamemaster can create adventure or campaign opportunities for the players to successfully roleplay their characters' personalities and lifestyles.
After determining the adventure goal, the gamemaster must
provide some possible ways the players can achieve the goal.
Players often lose interest in an adventure that offers no clear
paths to reach the goal. At the same time, don't try to force the
players into a particular plan. Offer them a few alternate avenues
so that they can decide themselves how to achieve the goal. And
don't spell things out for them. The players don't need to know
exactly how they might accomplish their task-they simply need
to be aware of the possibilities. Prepare for the unexpected-players sometimes devise very strange strategies to achieve a goal.
THE OPPOSITION
Every story needs one or more antagonists, or "bad guys,"
and Shadowrun contains a broad range from which gamemasters
can choose. The antagonist is simply the main obstacle between
the player characters and their goal. An adventure antagonist can
consist of one or more Individuals, a group or organization, a
great dragon, and so on.
Don't settle for one-dimensional, "cardboard" villains-the
antagonist is the main source of conflict and drama in an adventure, and so make your NPC antagonists full-fledged characters,
with distinct personalities and motivations. Be thorough and careful when creating the antagonist's abilities and goals.
Complex personalities and motives allow antagonists to act
in unpredictable and unexpected ways. Additionally, player characters might be able to exploit an antagonist's personality or
motives during their attempts to overcome the opponent.
Creating a personality and goals for an antagonist will also help
the gamemaster decide how powerful the opponent is and what
types of methods the opponent will use to achieve his, her or its
goals. Some opponents may use subtle plots and tricks, even brainwashing others to use as tools against the runners. Other opponents
may try to kill the runners outright. An antagonist such as Lofwyr
might "befriend" runners and spare their lives-so that he can call
in his favor in the future when he needs someone to perform a suicidal mission or take the rap for a failed operation.
Finally, keep in mind that NPCs represent only the "traditional" Shadowrun opponents. Anything that acts as an obstacle to
the players or threatens them can serve as an antagonist-nonmetahuman, even non-sentient beings, creatures, systems and so
on. A highly sophisticated security system, a hostile and
Awakened wilderness, paranormal critters, even normal animals
can be used as antagonists. Using non-traditional opponents provides both players and gamemasters with opportunities to stretch
their skills, abilities and imaginations.
COMPLICATIONS
If all shadowruns were as simple as gathering allies and blasting through the opposition, they wouldn't be very exciting for long.
Heck, if it were that easy, adventures would take an hour and
Shadowrun would have gone the way of the dodo. Complications
are unexpected twists and turns that help keep things interesting
and force the players and characters to stay alert.
Throw in one, perhaps two, three, or more complications in
every adventure. A complication can be as simple as a piece of
equipment failing or as complex as the adventure's goal turning
out to be something other than what the players originally
believed. For example, a team performing a run in a Trans-Polar
Aleut nation with all the stealth technology and secrecy they can
muster might be attacked by a marauding gang-a "gang" that
just happens to have the standard-issue weaponry of a corporation the runner's fixer works with on a regular basis. The runners
should realize that something's rotten, and they'll have to change
their plans accordingly. Or perhaps halfway through a corporate
extraction, the targeted research scientist starts mumbling a mysterious name. Just as the runners are about to deliver him to the
Johnson, the scientist-who was supposed to be a willing extraction-pops something into his mouth and dies moments later.
Time to investigate him, the job, and their employer. Maybe the
runners perform a simple burglary, only to discover that the item
they've stolen belongs to a dragon's treasure hoard.
Finally, gamemasters can always rely on that old stand-by,
the double-crossing Mr. Johnson, who might lie about what corp
he's from (if he's from one at all), set the runners up to be killed,
not pay them, decide they know too much, pay them in traceable
"screamer" credsticks that transmit their locations to the cops, or
otherwise use them and "screw them over."
Complications are the main way to inject the unpredictability
of "real life" into adventures, keep them interesting for players,
and provide the "intrigue" that is one of Shadowrun's distinguishing characteristics. Like everything else in Shadowrun, however, use complications judiciously. If you throw too many complications at players, they'll begin to feel like they have less and
less control over their characters' lives, and your game may
become frustrating and boring rather than enjoyably complex.
PLOTTING A SHADOWRUN ADVENTURE
When plotting a conventional story, a writer looks at the
goals of the main characters and then provides obstacles to those
goals to create dramatic tension. Shadowrun adventures are plotted in basically the same manner, except that the player characters serve as the protagonists.
For this reason, custom-designed adventures can often be
more fun than published Shadowrun adventures. A gamemaster
knows his player characters better than anyone else, and that
knowledge can enable him to accurately tailor adventures to
those player characters and their goals.
GETTING STARTED
Every adventure starts with an idea-a seed from which the
story grows. Fortunately, there's no lack of sources for adventure
ideas. Any Shadowrun book-adventure books, sourcebooks and
even rulebooks-can provide ideas. In fact, certain sourcebooks,
such as Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon, contain adventure
hooks specifically designed to help gamemasters create adventures from the material provided in the book. The "black information" posted by shadowrunners in the various books is especially
rich with adventure Ideas. This black info, posted by members of
the shadow community, often describes various hooks, clues,

vendettas and prior runs that can be converted into usable adventures. If a published adventure does not suit your group, it might
contain useful plot elements, NPCs and other ideas that can be
used in custom-designed adventures.
Even a group's own past games or campaigns can provide
adventure ideas. Loose ends and unresolved plot lines from old
adventures can serve as ideas for new adventures. Bring back an
old adversary that everyone thought was dead or introduce a
"successor" intent on carrying on the adversary's schemes. Call in
some of the old favors that the player characters owe their contacts and allies or have one of them ask for a favor from one of the
characters.
With a little imagination, nearly anything can provide suitable
adventure ideas-films, novels, other roleplaying games, TV.
video games, news media and magazines, even events at work or
school. Try keeping a notebook or a journal handy and jotting
down anything you see or read that sounds like it might have
potential use in an adventure story. When you're looking for ideas
for a game session or campaign, you can review your notes and
choose a single event or concept, or combine several related
Items into a complex, intriguing story line.
CHOOSING THE CAST
Choosing a cast for the adventure-the NPCs. organizations,
groups and opponents involved in the story-provides yet another way to shape the adventure. Different "actors" have different
motives, goals and operating methods. Using characters that play
a part in published Shadowrun books helps tie an adventure to
the larger Shadowrun world.
A gamemaster can choose the cast of an adventure at any
point while creating an adventure. Some may prefer to do so after
deciding on a premise. Others may want to start by casting the
major "actors" in the adventure, then establishing a premise
based on the interests and previous actions of the people and
organizations to be involved in the story.

The actors in an adventure can be individuals, small or large
groups or organizations, or any combination of the "players" of
the Shadowrun universe. An actor may play his part on the stage
or behind the scenes. Generally, big actors and big adventures go
hand in hand. For example, a war between local gangs can seem
fairly routine to some runners. But If the Triads are backing one
gang and the Mafia is backing the other, a bigger and potentially
more dangerous scenario begins to take shape. Now, if that same
war takes place near a secret Saeder-Krupp research facility.
Lofwyr himself might take notice and really heat things up.
The following entries offer a few suggestions for potential
actors based on descriptions of various individuals, groups and
organizations in published Shadowrun books, though this list is
by no means exhaustive. Many Shadowrun sourcebooks also
include descriptions of specific NPCs and organizations, and suggestions for using them in adventures and campaigns.
Corporations
Big megacorporations such as Ares and Mitsuhama have
been fiercely competing with one another for decades. With the
recent rise of mid- and small-sized corps in the Shadowrun universe, business has become more cutthroat than ever.
Organized Crime
The Mafia and yakuza come to mind immediately, but don't
forget the Triads, Seoulpa Rings, T-bird smugglers and pirates. All
of these organized crime groups prey on innocent people, not-soinnocent people and on one another. Deadly power struggles are
common between and even within these groups. Any community that would be reluctant to take its problems to law enforcement
makes a tempting target for organized-crime protection rackets,
and mobsters continue to control a cornucopia of crime industries,
ranging from smuggling to BTL production to sexual slavery.
Cops
Lone Star, Knight Errant, Hard Corps, Wolverine, Eagle, Thugs
with Guns-who and what do the law-enforcement organizations
in the Shadowrun universe really serve and protect? Are they
clean or corrupt? Where do their jurisdictions end?
Law-enforcement types share a natural, mutual hostility with
shadowrunners, and there's no better cover for a racket than a
police badge.
Gangs
Shadowrun gangs run the gamut from mutual-protection
clubs of friends to groups of street punks who joytoy for money to
RV-equipped go-gangs that roam the interstate highways to syndicates of hardened criminais with drugs, guns and connections.
There's also the old-fashioned biker gangs that hang in heavymetal bars and provide security for concerts just to make ends
meet, and a hundred other specialty gangs.
Military/Para-Military Groups
The land, sea and air forces of any country possess military
resources that most corps can't match, including submarine fleets,
entire divisions of soldiers, novahot tech toys and major mojo.
Nearly every modern military contains air, armor and recon
branches, as well as those nifty Special Forces. The Gl Joes and
Janes of the Sixth World are usually called in to handle seriously
weird magic situations or unexplained phenomena (such as Bug
City), but the militaries of nearly any combination of countries (the
Ute Nation and Tir na nOg. CAS and ... another faction of the CAS)
might face off over matters of "vital national interest" in the world
of Shadowrun.
Conflict might also come in the form of the Seattle Metroplex
Guardsmen and other civil policing groups sworn to control riots
and otherwise keep order in Seattle.
Politicians and Policlubs
The UCAS presidential election of 2057 may be over, but congressmen are elected every other year, Politics is a dirty business,
so it's not surprising that shadowruns can become particularly
messy when they're politically motivated. City councilmen, mayors,
governors, senators, even folks no one thinks about, such as
Supreme Court justices and the Surgeon General, may hire shadowrunners to act as bodyguards, gather information on their opponents or conduct "dirty tricks" campaigns.
Policlubs also present a wide range of roleplaying possibilities. Metahuman and human rights, secessionists, abortion. the
death penalty, gun control-name any cause or prejudice you can
think of, and the odds are there's a policlub espousing or condemning it.
International Opponents
Megacorporations may have usurped much of the power
once wielded by national governments, but that hasn't lowered
the stakes of international geopolitics and it hasn't reduced the
number of international spies, wheeler-dealers and terrorists running around. The CIA, Interpol, the successors of the KGB, the Tir
Paladins, international fixers, arms dealers and general troublemaking terrorists are just a few potential international actors that
can play a role in an adventure.
Media Types
Media types can add a dash of glamour, danger and good
old-fashioned sex appeal to an adventure. Trid networks, radio,
simsense, music, sports and flatscreen movie theaters remain big
business in the Sixth World. From simple radio interviews to
Desert Wars, from pirate trideo broadcasts to desperate rockers
faking their own deaths, the media types of the Shadowrun world
will go to any lengths to boost their ratings and sales. Muckraking
investigative reporting shows, daytime talk shows, combat-game
shows, professional wrestling, simporn, music trideos-they all
generate billions of nuyen each year, and the assorted stars, hasbeens, producers. media conglomerates and organized-crime
types involved in the business fight tooth-and-nail for their share.
Shadowrunners and Other Shady Characters
Player characters need not be the only shadowrunners involved
in an adventure. Shadowrunning teams operate more loosely than
organized-crime groups and corporations and generally consist of
individuals with greater skills and more highly developed talents

than those that make up gangs. By definition, shadowrunners do
the work that no one else can or will do. The profession generally
attracts the marginal types who just don't fit in with twenty-firstcentury militaries, corporations, organized crime groups and other
"acceptable" societal norms. Consequently, NPC shadowrunners
provide an excellent way for gamemasters to introduce wild, outlandish and colorful characters into adventures. Furthermore, runners are a notoriously competitive bunch, and no one makes a better match for a shadowrunner than another runner.
Ordinary People
Ordinary people are the folks you deal with during your "normal" daily life-bank employees, the clerks at the Department of
Motor Vehicles. insurance adjusters, temporary employee services, caterers, janitors, garbage men, telephone solicitors, college professors, lawyers, squatters, girlfriends, boyfriends and so
on. All these people have a place in the Shadowrun universe, too.
Watch television for two hours. Design a run that involves a member of a profession portrayed on a program or commercial, or a
scene that requires runners to put on the hat of an ordinary person for a little while. Interaction with ordinary people might not
create great drama, but it might generate some light comic relief,
remind the runners who gets hurt when they act carelessly, develop new contacts or add a little metahuman interest to an otherwise corp-focused story line.
Odds and Ends
The Shadowrun world offers a mix of science fiction and fantasy that generates a wide range of individual beings and organizations unique to the universe (or distinct from similar groups in
other mythos), such as ancient elves, free spirits, dragons, Things
Man Was Not Meant to Know, ghosts, vampires, werejaguars and
initiatory groups, not to mention whatever's bouncing around in
the Matrix. A member of any of these species or groups can serve
as an actor in a campaign, or gamemasters can create their own
unique life forms based on these types.
THE DECISION TREE
Published Shadowrun adventures use a "decision tree" format. Unlike a single, linear plot line, the decision-tree format
describes several courses of action player characters may take. The
players' decisions, in turn, determine the adventure's outcome.
By using the decision-tree format in your own adventures, you
can provide player characters with the same flexibility and decision-making power.
Start by thinking of your adventure plot as a flow chart with
two points. Point A represents the beginning of the adventure,
the point at which the players become involved. Point B represents the end of the adventure, at which the player characters
achieve the adventure goal. A linear plot would have a single path
from Point A to Point B. In the decision-tree format, however,
multiple paths, or "branches," connect the beginning and end of
the adventure.
To create each different path, simply start at Point A and
write down the possible courses of action the characters might
take at that point. For example, if they are meeting with a Mr.
Johnson who offers them a job, they have two obvious choicesaccept the job or reject it. Depending on the player characters,
they might also take other actions, such as starting a fight with the
Johnson. Once you've determined the character's likely choices,
start a plot line for each choice. The next point on Plot Line 1 will
cover what happens if the runners accept the job offer. The next
point on Plot Line 2 will cover what happens if they reject the
offer. Plot Line 3 would cover what happens if they attack the
Johnson.
Continue this process at each event in the different plot lines.
Simply ask yourself, what are the characters likely to do, and what
will happen next because of their choice? Make notes about the
NPC opponents the characters are likely to encounter along each
plot line, important locations where the action will take place, and
so on. These notes prepare you to run each encounter as it occurs,
regardless of the path the characters follow. Be sure to note any
complications you intend to throw at the players (see
Complications, p. 97, and When the Drek Hits the Fan, below.
for more Information)
Keep in mind that different plot lines can merge and intersect. The characters' decision at one point may lead them back to
another plot line, or various plot lines may lead back to one main
line. Additionally, some scenes in an adventure can be arranged
so that they can take place in a variety of orders without affecting the overall plot of the adventure. For example, some scenes
may simply describe different locations characters can visit while
doing legwork; the characters can visit the locations in whatever
order they choose without changing the effect of the information
they discover.
No matter how many different "branches" you plan for your
decision tree, players tend to surprise you with unexpected plans
that take them along paths you didn't predict. In these cases,
simply stay flexible and modify your planned material to suit the
new direction.
For examples of the decision-tree format, look at a few published Shadowrun adventures and outline the various plots. You'll
quickly recognize the different branches of the decision tree used
in each adventure.
WHEN THE DREK HITS THE FAN
Besides injecting the unpredictability of real life into adventures, complications make convenient turning points to change
the direction of an adventure and keep the player characters from
proceeding directly to the adventure goal.
Usually two or three major complications are enough to get
the adventure off and running. After that, keep an eye out for the
complications that the players themselves will provide for you and
learn to use them to your advantage. For example, if one character badly falls a Stealth Test and is captured by corp security while
the other runners escape, weave that complication into the story.
Will the corporation get information from the captured runner?
What will it do with that information? Will the captive runner's
companions try to rescue him or hang him out to dry? If they
abandon him, how will the captured runner react? Even one or
two complications can spawn numerous new plots and subplots.
See Complications, p. 97. for more information.

Allies
Allies are contacts and NPCs who can help player characters
achieve their adventure goal. Though they need not function as a
deus ex machina, the fact remains that allies are often most helpful as tools to get the runners out of an impossible situation and
back on track in the adventure.
Like antagonists, allies should possess their own personalities
and motives. They shouldn't simply wait around to offer help
when the player characters need it. Every ally should have his, her
or its own reasons for helping the player characters. Some might
help the runners out of mutual respect or friendship. Others may
offer to help for their own selfish reasons-usually because they
are opposed to the antagonist as well. Still others may help
because the player characters' success will further their own plots.
Consequently, characters may want to keep a close eye on their
allies as well as their enemies-because an ally who is helpful one
day may abandon or even turn on the players the next day.
The most fickle ally of any shadowrunner is Fate-also known
as Lady Luck, Fortune. Chance, kismet and many other names.
Fate provides gamemasters with a convenient way to give player
characters lucky breaks when needed to keep an adventure moving along. Unfortunately, what Fate giveth. Fate also taketh
away-runners who benefit from sudden good fortune may run
into unexpected complications later on (when such complications
suit the gamemaster's plans, of course).
AFTERMATH
Once the characters achieve the adventure goal or give up
trying. it's time to wrap up the adventure. Consider a variety of
endings for the adventure. Try not to fall in love with one particular ending or climatic scene. The decisions of your player characters are likely to change your plot early in the adventure, and an
ending that doesn't flow naturally from earlier events will seem
contrived. Simply keep the scene in mind in case an opportunity
to use it arises in another adventure.
The consequences, or aftermath, of different endings may
also affect which ending you choose to present. Events that happen in one adventure can be used in future games to provide continuity and richness to your campaign. Jotting down answers to
the following questions is an excellent way to determine likely
directions for the aftermath of an adventure:
· Did the players leave any loose ends hanging? If so, would any
of them be fun to pursue in later adventures?
. Did the runner's actions hurt or anger any NPCs, corporations, or
other groups (specifically, anyone who might want revenge)?
· Which NPCs and player characters were the major "actors" in the
story? Which ones acted memorably?
. Did the runners' actions attract any media attention? If so, would
this attention mark the runners as targets?
· Did the runners create any Enemies for themselves?
. Did other parties notice the runners' actions?
· Did the runners leave evidence behind? If so, how much?
(Runners may be SINless, but if corporate security forces and
cops repeatedly find the same unidentified fingerprints and lots
of shell casings at specific break-ins, they're going to start a file
on the people who left those prints and casings.)
· What's the real identity of the Johnson? Have the runners
worked for him or her before? If so, are the two runs connected
somehow? Why is the Johnson interested in the runners? Is
there anyone who might pay for a run against this Johnson?
· Is it time to let a player character achieve the personal goal that
she's always dreamed of-and will it happen in the way she
expected?
PAYMENT AND REWARD
The end of a successful run means it's time to count the
nuyen. How much money is an appropriate fee for a team of runners? The gamemaster ultimately decides, based on the risk of the
run, the employer's ability and willingness to pay and the runners
reputations, but the following guidelines may help set appropriate fees.
First, keep in mind that player characters will average about
one shadowrun per month. A good starting point for an individual runner's payment is one month's living expenses, plus the
cost of gear needed for the run. If the player characters on the
team have different lifestyles, use an average of the characters
lifestyle costs to determine their living expenses.
An occasional big windfall serves as a great campaign tease.
Windfalls make excellent pay-offs after hard-fought campaigns or
excellent stepping stones for new campaigns. Keep windfalls
rare-they should reflect the difficulty of the campaign that's just
finished or the difficulties likely to afflict the upcoming campaign.
As a rule of thumb, a windfall should equal roughly 6 months of
the character's lifestyle cost. Windfalls always come from unexpected sources.
Runner fees and windfalls need not be briefcases filled with
credisticks. In fact, alternate payment methods are a great way to
enable player characters to survive and continue to perform runs
without accumulating fortunes. Instead of nuyen, payment may
take the form of valuable data, individuals, equipment, paid
expenses, time in a magic-research facility or special Matrix
access. SIN numbers also make good alternate payment, as do
Doc Wagon contracts and cyberware implants. For more ideas,
look in the Equipment Tables at the end of the Shadowrun rulebook or other Shadowrun books. These sections contain numerous items that most characters can't afford but would willingly
accept from a grateful Johnson.
Double all base fees and windfalls if you're running an amoral
campaign in which the player characters are more concerned with
making money than doing the right or honorable thing (see
Karma and the Amoral Campaign, p. 78). Adjust fees and windfalls to match the needs of your game.
ARCHETYPAL ADVENTURE PLOTS
Experienced Shadowrun players may find their characters
caught up in certain "classic" adventure plots again and again,
each time struggling against a different variation on a theme. This
section describes several of these archetypal adventure plots and
provides ideas for using them as models for your own unique
adventures.

Remember that variety is the spice of life-and of Shadowrun
adventures. Every new plot or twist on a familiar story creates
fond memories and keeps players coming back to the table. Keep
your players' interest by mixing things up. Change the specifics,
or "variables." of an adventure to keep the mood, tone and focus
of adventures fresh. Sure, a dragon or powerful elf that's pulling
the strings during an adventure is fine-once. Maybe even twice,
but your players are going to get bored if they continually see the
same old face.
ASSASSINATION
The employer wants someone dead. Variables include:
· Level and types of security around the target (magic, Matrix and
physical security measures)
· The events triggered by the target's death
· The conditions for the assassination. Trying to make someone's
death look like an accident or a specific type of accident (run
over with a garbage truck, heart attack, electrocuted by a power
line, random violence) is a lot tougher than simply blowing the
target away.
BLACKMAIL
The employer wants evidence that the target is doing something wrong. Not only that, he wants the runners to let the target
know that someone's on to him and to collect hush money from
the target. Generally, blackmail jobs require long-term employment and extra levels of secrecy on the part of the runners.
BODYGUARD
The player characters are hired to keep a subject alive or
undamaged. Variables include:
· The subject's lifestyle and health
. The resources, intentions, knowledge and expertise of his
would-be killers
COURIER/SMUGGLING
The team must pick up a message or transport cargo from
one location to another. Variables include:
· The point of origin and destination-Redmond, Tir Tairngire, a
remote spot in the desert, a crippled submarine. Maria
Mercurial's penthouse, a restricted military base and so on
· The number of borders that must be crossed
· The mode of transport-foot, train, car, boat, panzer, ultra-light
and so on
· The nature of the cargo-a person. chip, suitcase, 500 underfed
security dogs, communications suite, nuclear bomb, magical
focus, red rose and so on
· The legality of the cargo
DATASTEAL
The shadowrunners have to snatch data from a highly
secured location. Variables include:
· The target location-for example, CIA headquarters, a remote
experimental lab in the Amazonian rain forest, the ZurichOrbital bank. a flophouse in downtown Seattle
· The form of the target data-for example, computer data
hooked up to the Matrix, off-line computer data, hard copy,
ideas in someone's head
· The nature of the target data-for example, research plans,
names and locations of undercover cops, Things Man Was Not
Meant to Know, kiss-and-tell info on the president
· What happens if the runners scan the data-for example, they
discover their employer is betraying them, an ancient curse
boils their brains, Mr. Johnson sends goons to silence them,
they find out they should give it to someone worthier, they find
out the identity of their father
DISTRACTION
A duplicitous Johnson hires the runners to perform a mission.
Unknown to them, they are really serving to distract attention
from some other nefarious activity. Variables include:
· Who the runners are impersonating-shadowrunners, uniformed
Lone Star cops, eco-terrorists, Johnny Whocker and the Guitar
Trogs and so on
· The goal of their mission-break into an embassy, beat protesters senseless on camera, attract media attention by blowing up
an oil refinery, play a concert and attract an assassin's bullet and
so on
· The real story-another shadowrun across town, interrupting the
first five minutes of a TV sitcom to prove a point, giving the Mr.
Johnson time to escape, Johnny wants out of the music business
and so on
· Whether or not the characters know they are only a distraction
for a larger plot
DESTRUCTION
The employer hires the team to erase, wipe out, or otherwise
destroy a target. Variables include:
· The target itself-for example. a datafile, North Sea oil rig, ritual
sample, biohazard, "indestructible" magical focus, graveyard, a
centimeter of a summoning circle
· How many targets exist-for example, ten copies, two linked
rigs with a narrow bridge, seventeen hairs
. Whether or not the job endangers innocent bystanders
ENCRYPTION/DECRYPTION
The employer wants something decoded or secured. The job
can serve as a quick shadowrun in itself, be tacked onto another
shadowrun, or serve as a complication.
ENFORCEMENT
The runners are hired to "send a message" to someone.
Variables include:
· How the message is delivered-for example, a stern warning.
nailing a dead cat to the target's door, planting a bomb in the
target's refrigerator, tattooing the message on the foreheads of
the target's kids
· How publicly the message is delivered-switching the simsense
chips on the target's bedside table, kicking down the target's
front door, broadcasting a ten-minute death threat over every
major network and so on

· The size and power of the target-for example, a single person.
a family, a group of protesters, rowdy folks at a bar. Ares
Macrotechnology
HOAX/COUNTERFEIT
The runners must use their creative talents and connections
to stage a hoax or create a counterfeit item. Examples include faking a death, creating a false charity or bank that will attract
deposits from a target, falsifying records or "framing" someone
for a crime.
INVESTIGATION
The runners are hired to gather information on an event or
person. Variables include:
· The nature of the information. "Low-stakes" information includes
evidence for messy divorce cases, missing persons, who was
present when a robbery took place and so on. "High-stakes"
information includes photo reconnaissance for a military strike.
political secrets, enough evidence for the police to bust a drug
ring.
· The means of gathering the information-for example, interviewing witnesses, Infiltrating a weapons-smuggling ring,
matrix searches, "test-driving" an experimental combat vehicle
or weapon system
EXTRACTION (KIDNAPPING)
The employer wants someone bodily picked up and taken
somewhere. This is usually known as an "extraction," because the
target can be willing or unwilling. Variables include:
· The target-for example, a dangerous parole violator, simsense
starlet, researcher who wants to defect from his corporation,
ornery elephants
. How long the target must be held-1 day, 3 months and so on
. How the target should be treated-like a queen, don't break
more than two bones and so on
· The size of the target-for example, one individual, a group of
six people, all the passengers on an airplane
· Additional Instructions-keep the target captive on his private
cruise liner, deliver him to another team, brainwash her, execute
him, write the ransom note, escort the target to the personnel
department at Corporation X and so on
PLANT
The runners are hired to plant an object somewhere. Objects
might include electronic listening devices (bugs), remotely controlled or timed bombs, microfilm or datafiles for later pick-up.
and restricted milspec weapons.
RETRIEVAL OF OBJECT
This is the classic "go get the secret prototype" mission.
Gamemasters can vary it by substituting different items for the
prototype-a powerful focus or magical weapon, a symbolically
significant item such as the Holy Grail or the sword of the employer's grandfather, and so on. Other variables include the security
around the object and other people intent on "retrieving" it for
themselves.
SECURITY
The employer needs someone to provide security. Variables
include:
· Item/subject to be protected-for example, a ritual magic circle,
vacuum-sealed vampire, entire rock concert, your fixer during a
BTL deal, a corporate facility, a storehouse of food
. Whether or not the runners know the true nature of the item or
the real identity of the subject
· Type of security to be provided-physical, magical, Matrix, any
combination of those and so on
· Restrictions on the level of force the runners can use. Remember.
drunk bar patrons sue, black-ops teams don't.
· The threat from which the team is protecting the item/personfor example, petty criminals, other shadowrunners, heavily
armed mercenaries, corporate hit teams
TAILCHASER
This adventure plot creates a specialized sort of double-cross.
The employer has two or more goals that the runners may fulfill
either by succeeding in their task, failing in their task, being captured by the opposition, dying in the attempt or participating in
any number of other outcomes. Whatever the runners accomplish
or fail to accomplish provides the employer with a certain amount
of desired information, and he, she or it walks away from the run
satisfied with the results. The primary effect of this type of run is
to demoralize the player characters-no matter how well or how
poorly they perform their task, the employer is equally pleased
with the outcome, forcing the characters to accept that their
actions just didn't matter. This type of adventure can be particularly devastating if the team loses a member or two in the course
of the run.
WAR
The employer wants a lot of people hurt, Intimidated, ruined
or killed so they can no longer harm his interests or hinder his
plans. The runners may start slowly and gradually escalate their
tactics or simply begin with a full-scale conflict.
WILD THINGS
The runners are hired to observe, track, capture and tame, or
hunt and kill a particular critter or critters. Variables include:
· The target critter(s) Itself-for example, wolf pack, troglodyte.
nomad, wraith, dragon
· The innate intelligence of the target critter
· The critter's natural habitat
CAMPAIGN CONSIDERATIONS
A campaign is a linked series of adventures that form a larger overall story, like individual episodes of a television show or the
chapters of a novel. Characters develop and change over the
course of a campaign, just as they do in other stories. A campaign
also allows a gaming group to tell many different stories with the
same set of characters.
A successful campaign, like a successful adventure, requires
some planning. This section describes the various considerations
a gamemaster should take into account while planning a campaign and includes suggestions for creating fun and interesting
story lines.
PLAYER CHARACTERS
The player characters themselves are probably the most
Important consideration of creating a campaign, because the player characters' interests and abilities will determine the most satisfying type of campaign for the group to play. For example, if all
the players want to play magician characters, the gamemaster
should create a campaign specially tailored to provide plenty of
opportunities for them to use magic. If the players want to run a
team of cyber-solider mercenaries. the gamemaster can go for an
over-the-top action-oriented campaign. Gamemasters may even
wish to use one of the specialized alternate campaign types provided in Alternate Campaign Concepts (pp. 110-30) to create a
challenging campaign tailored to their players.
In addition to selecting an appropriate campaign type for the
player group, the gamemaster should try to devise a campaign
that provides each individual player character with opportunities
to use his or her unique abilities and "grab the spotlight."
Creating the Team's Characters
Players have two options when creating a team. They may
develop their characters as a group, or each player may develop
his or her character without any input from the other players.
Designing characters as a group helps ensure that they will
fit well together as a team. Players can provide their characters
with common Enemies, give them previous adventures together
or connect them to each other with ties of friendship or blood. By
working together, players can ensure that their characters represent a variety of different specialties and abilities, enhancing the
versatility of the group as a whole and reducing the number of
characters possessing similar skills and abilities. Designing characters as a group also enables the gamemaster to tailor his
adventures and campaigns to the skills of the characters more
easily and provide enough situations for all of the characters to
get in on the action.
Creating characters as a group, however, also takes away the
element of surprise that adds to the fun of discovering things
about your teammates. By designing their characters without
input from the rest of the group, players can give their characters
background, contacts, Edges and Flaws and abilities that they
keep secret from their teammates. Such secrets can serve as
jumping-off points for unexpected events and opportunities for
roleplaying. The drawback to individual character generation is
that it may produce ill-matched or unevenly balanced teams.
When team members have little in common. simply getting along
with one another can become an adventure in itself for the player
characters.
Assembling the Team
The gamemaster can assemble the individual player characters into a team in a variety of ways. Providing the player characters with a common contact (fixer, Mr. Johnson, Mob boss and so
on) is probably the easiest way. In this case, the contact has a job
that requires the specific skills of each character.
Giving the team members a common purpose may produce
the most cohesive group. The common interest may be as simple as staying alive and making a fast nuyen on the mean streets
of the Sixth World or something more involved. Generally, the
more invested each character is in the common purpose, the
more likely the runners are to work together, though that doesn't mean that the characters have to like one another, The
Shadowrun universe contains plenty of individuals who don't
like each other but are willing to put aside their mutual dislike to
achieve a common goal.
Defending against a common Enemy or opponent offers one
example of a common purpose. In this example, if time allows.
the gamemaster can even run a few preliminary mini-adventures
with one or two player characters at a time to introduce or foreshadow the Enemy's interest in each character.
Fostering Team Spirit
Assembling a team is only one of the challenges facing a
gamemaster and his or her players. Keeping a team together can
prove even more difficult.
Both players and gamemasters share a responsibility to tolerate one another and find ways for their characters to work together as teams, but gamemasters have the greatest stake in keeping
things together-simply because gamemasters spend so much
time preparing adventures and campaigns.
Assembling a group of players who get along in real life is a
simple way to increase the chances that the player's characters
will get along in the fictional universe. However, the power to roll
dice and tell someone you've killed their character can produce
tensions between even the best friends.
Gamemasters can promote "team spirit" among characters
by emphasizing the characters' non-business relationships.
Characters that hang out and relax with one another are more likely to work out their disagreements peacefully than characters who
are mere business acquaintances. because roleplaying non-business time gives characters chances to learn about one another. For
example, the appearance of a new troll teammate who went
berserk and killed every single person in the Aztechnology building might prompt characters to call the cyber-psycho squad.
However, those same characters might have a different view of
their new teammate when they learn that Azzie goons killed the
troll's sister first-and in a particularly unpleasant fashion.
Isolating a team of characters from the rest of the world can
also help foster team spirit. Isolating a team forces the members to
depend on and trust one another. For example, if you dump a
Seattle-based team in the middle of the Mojave Desert or drop a
team of human runners into the Ork Underground, they will need
to rely on each other simply because they won't be able to trust
anyone else. Even the simple act of putting street runners into unfamiliar corporate territory can encourage them to work together.
A common Enemy or opponent-an individual, group or
entity that the characters can defeat only by banding togethermay also force characters to work together and foster team spirit.
Running a game session only when all the players are present may
also promote team spirit. If characters are always hired as a unit,

they are likely to feel like a team. Conversely, If new characters are
constantly coming and going, the player characters may view
themselves more as individuals than as a team.
Finally, listen to your players and try to give them what they
want. Players who are happy with the game and their characters
are more tolerant of their fellow players' idiosyncrasies and mistakes than players who are unhappy with a game. Similarly, everyone enjoys a chance to play the hero every now and then, so give
each player character opportunities to do so. This will reduce jealousy and rivalries among player characters and make player characters more supportive of one another.
Team Tensions
While playing together as a cohesive, trusting team offers
many advantages, occasional tensions and suspicions among
teammates can provide great roleplaying opportunities. Team
tensions can inspire impassioned arguments and conversations
among characters and memorable nights of roleplaying for players. For the sake of enjoyable gaming, however, it's probably best
to develop players' team spirit and group cohesion before introducing team tensions. A group consisting of five ork street sams
and a Humanis decker is likely to lead to a quick fight and a dead
character. But characters who learn that the new teammate who
saved their lives last night is a former terrorist may be willing to
get along despite deeply felt, contrasting beliefs.
Keep in mind that some issues are more volatile than others.
Characters who might forgive a new teammate's questionable
past may not be willing to accept a racist character or one who
acts specifically against them.
THEMES
The overall themes of a campaign may determine the direction and tone of the campaign as well as specific adventure plots.
For example, adventures for a campaign based on themes of
revenge will be quite different than adventures for a campaign
based on themes of greed.
Other themes include heroism, redemption, fighting the
good fight, and simply making as much money as possible without getting caught, improving the living conditions of a neighborhood, protecting children, wiping out prejudice, wiping out
another race, saving or destroying the earth and so on.
Certain themes may also provide common purposes for
groups of player characters. For example, characters in a revengethemed campaign may want to settle a score with a common
enemy. Characters in a redemption-themed campaign might join
together to perform a mission to redeem themselves or others.
MORALITY
Players and gamemasters should also consider the moral tone
of their campaigns. Are the player characters heartless mercenarles who would do anything for nuyen, or are they knights in shining chrome and leather? Most characters fall somewhere in
between, but gamemasters and their players may still want to
establish some campaign ground rules beforehand. These types of
ground rules will let players know what is expected of their characters and prevent unpleasant surprises later in the game.
Some groups prefer principled characters who avoid unnecessary violence and killing. Other groups prefer plenty of combat
and have no problem with geeking any opponents who come
along, as long as the money is right. The Shadowrun universe has
room for both types of players and everyone in between. Each
player group must decide for itself what kind of team it wants to
play.
SCOPE
In a roleplaying adventure, the player characters are always
at the center of the story. The scope of a campaign is simply how
far out from that center the characters' story extends. How much
impact will the characters' actions have on the rest of the world?
Are they just cogs in the big machine of the metroplex, unable to
really change the way things are, or are they visionaries with the
power and influence to shape the fate of nations? The scope of the
campaign can determine its stability and direction, as well as how
it will change and grow over time.
Campaigns with limited scopes are usually best for beginners,
because attempting to comprehend and react to all of the events
of the Shadowrun universe can be quite daunting. A small scale
also allows the gamemaster to control the campaign more easily.
though it limits the players' options a bit as well.
More experienced players may find small-scale campaigns
too confining. while others find them very comfortable. The players of an individual group should decide if they prefer to move on
to larger-scale adventures. Players should also consider their relative skill, ability and power levels when selecting the scope of
their campaign. Characters who aren't capable of tackling worldclass threats may want to stick to small-scale campaigns lest they
find themselves hopelessly outclassed. On the other hand, a global-scale campaign may present the ideal challenge for experienced runners who want to topple or protect governments,
megacorps or other powerful and influential figures-and are
ready to take on very powerful opponents.
LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION
The Sixth World offers a broad range of adventure settings.
from urban sprawls to Awakened wilderness areas. Gamemasters
should consider the settings that will be used in a campaign while
planning the campaign, because the choice of settings can have a
great impact on the story. Gamemasters should ask themselves
questions such as: Will a campaign's adventures take place in a
specific metroplex or nation? Which locales will the characters frequent? Which corporations have the most influence in those
places? What is the local shadow-community like? What are the
local laws?
When planning campaign settings, gamemasters should
avoid the common temptation to send their players bouncing all
over the globe during a single campaign (unless, of course, the
players' group is a jet-setting, globe-hopping team of high-priced
runners). In many cases, players in globe-hopping campaigns start
feeling that nothing in the campaign is permanent or important.

THE FIRST RUN
The first run of any campaign is very important, because it
sets the tone of the campaign to follow and establishes the overall themes and premises of the campaign. Like the first line in a
short story or the first scene in a movie, the first run of a campaign
must grab the players' attention or they may soon lose interest in
the game. Additionally, it should "hook" the player characters
without overwhelming them; it should provide the basis for spinoff adventures and encourage the players to continue pursuing a
campaign. It should provide time for the different characters to
develop without becoming overly long or boring. It should reveal
enough to keep the players involved without giving away too
many mysteries.
Perhaps the best way to ensure that a first run does all these
things is to Incorporate into the first adventure the various elements discussed in this section-opportunities for each player
character to shine, an exciting and climactic plot, an external
threat that brings the players together as a team, and so on.
CHARACTER ADVANCEMENT
Gamemasters can control the speed of character advancement in their campaigns by adjusting the size of Karma awards for
adventures, providing opportunities for the characters to use their
accumulated Karma, controlling payment for runs and adjusting
the runners' expenses as necessary. Larger Karma awards enable
player characters to advance and gain power quickly, while smaller Karma awards slow character advancement. Similarly, higher
fees for runs will generally enable players to buy more equipment,
though gamemasters can exert control over player characters'
wealth by raising or lowering their expenses.
For more information on handling Karma and character
advancement, see the Advanced Rules section. p. 76.
KEEPING IT FRESH
Over time, any extended campaign may become a bit stale.
However, inventive gamemasters and creative players can take
several steps to revitalize campaigns and keep them fresh and
interesting.
Simply taking a break from the campaign and setting it aside
for a time may be enough to rejuvenate a campaign. A break
gives the gamemaster's and the players' creative "batteries" time
to recharge and may inspire renewed interest when the
gamemaster and players return to the campaign. Every group
must determine the appropriate length for a break. Some groups
may find that a few weeks is enough, while other groups may
want to take a few months off.
Alternatively, an ongoing campaign might need something
to shake it up a bit and get things moving again. The gamemaster might want to change the campaign's theme or focus to help
breathe new life into the story and the characters. For example.
one Shadowrun campaign that had been running for several years
had reached a point where the player characters were highly
capable shadowrunners with extensive backgrounds, resources
and abilities. The players no longer found the "typical" shadowruns challenging or interesting, and they had begun to grow
tired of their characters. To shake things up, the gamemaster set
up a new series of adventures in which the player characters were
framed for the murder of an important political figure and sent to a
UCAS federal prison. An influential fixer sprang the shadowrunners
from prison within a relatively short period, but during their jail time
the runners lost most of their contacts and resources, and their reputations took a serious beating. The characters found themselves on
the streets with little more than the clothes on their backs, in debt
to a mysterious fixer and looking to clear their names and avenge
themselves against the people who framed them. The campaign
was off and running again.
The Bug City, Super Tuesday, Shadows of the Underworld,
Portfolio of a Dragon, and Threats books all offer plentiful twists
that can help change the direction of a campaign and spark new
interest among players.
BLUEBOOKING
"Bluebooking" is an excellent roleplaying and story-development tool for campaigns.
Players who use a bluebook simply keep records of their characters in notebooks, A character's bluebook is like a diary-it can
include everything from personal recollections to private conversations between characters. They can be used to record character stories and background and between-adventure activities.
Using bluebooking to record private conversations between characters or between characters and gamemasters enables characters and
gamemasters to keep secrets from other players. This use makes bluebooking an ideal tool to inject paranoia, conspiracies, or simply a bit
of mystery into a game. To use bluebooking for secrets, a character
simply writes down the secret message or information in his notebook, then shows the notebook to the gamemaster or the character
with whom he wants to share the secret.
Gamemasters should carefully control bluebooking in their
games, however, because players may begin to conduct nearly all of
their interactions by bluebooking (which is not necessarily a bad
thing, as long as it's intentional) and abandon active roleplaying.
ENDING THE CAMPAIGN
Gamemasters can devise dramatic, "blaze-of-glory" endings for
campaigns or simply allow their player characters go their separate
ways and break up the team. In either case, the events and fallout of
the old campaign can be used as source material for a new campaign. Friends and foes alike can resurface in the new campaign,
along with unfinished business or other loose ends. If, for any reason, the players are no longer interested in playing their characters
at the end of a campaign, that need not spell the end of the player
characters. See Retirement, p. 87 for suggestions on using old characters in continuing games.
SOLUTIONS TO COMMON PROBLEMS
Most experienced gamemasters face the following common
challenges when gamemastering Shadowrun (and other) games
and campaigns:
· controlling "power-gamers." players who create super-characters
so powerful that they dominate the game
· maintaining overall game balance
· satisfactorily involving deckers and other unique character types in
games

· effectively using the overwhelming amount of Shadowrun information available
This section offers advice on dealing with these difficult situations.
POWER-GAMING
Power-gamers, sometimes (unkindly) referred to as
"munchkins" or "Monty Haulers," are players who create "supercharacters"-magicians with Initiate grade ratings in the double
digits and truckloads of foci and bound spirits, street sammies
with so much cyberware they become virtual walking tanks, deckers with Computer Skills of 12 and cyberdecks that make the
Fairlight Excalibur look like an abacus and so on.
Well, there's nothing wrong with power-gaming. (Despite
persistent rumors, FASA does not maintain a cadre of game police
ready to kick your door in. confiscate your rulebook and drag you
before the game Inquisition for violating the unwritten laws of
Shadowrun. Well. actually there are game police-but they're too
busy checking on BattleTech and Earthdawn rules violators to
bother with Shadowrun groups.) Seriously, FASA couldn't be
more pleased to hear that you're enjoying Shadowrun, no matter
how you play it.
However, If power-gaming starts killing the fun in your game,
then it's a problem. Generally, such discrepancies can be avoided
by meeting with your players and deciding on the general power
levels you want in your campaign before you start -a low-powered "street-level" campaign versus a wild and wahoo powergame of super-characters, for example. Even conscientious planning may not prevent a player character from amassing a superhuman power level that begins to spoil the fun for everyone else.
Gamemasters may use the strategies described in Obnoxious
Characters to control such players.
OBNOXIOUS CHARACTERS
Sometimes, players and/or their characters simply get out of
line and begin spoiling the group's fun. Players can be quite creative when it comes to spoiling a game-some may simply create characters that overpower everyone and everything else in the
game, while others may insist on following their characters' own
wacky plans or their own interpretations of the rules, regardless of
their fellow players' wishes. The simplest way to deal with such a
character is to kill him or her-the character, not the player, of
course. However, Shadowrun provides gamemasters with a variety of other, less-drastic ways to control such players.
Reason with the Player
Take the problem player aside and talk to him. Tell him that
he's creating a problem and how you think the problem can be
fixed. Reasoning with a problem player is always better than simply punishing the player's character. The player may not understand why his character is catching the drek or may decide that
the gamemaster is picking on his character for no reason.
If the player is not willing to change his or her behavior for
the benefit of the group. then it may be time for the player and
the group to part ways. If reasoning with the player fails. most of
the other measures described here won't work much better.
Put the Character in Jail
A stint in one of the prisons run by Lone Star or the government can go a long way toward improving a character's attitude.
If the character is SINless and lacks powerful connections, the
authorities may even want to try some experimental new "rehabilitation" techniques on the character.
Ruin His/Her Reputation
Reputation Is everything in the shadows. A character who
develops a reputation as a troublemaker and unreliable or uncontrollable on runs will eventually run out of people willing to work
with him or her. Such characters must shape up and take a few
low-paying, hazardous runs to rebuild their reps-or find themselves sliding right to the bottom of the shadow food-chain to get
chewed up.
Give Him/Her Bad Karma
Karma is a useful gamemaster tool for rewarding characters
who have done well in an adventure. Similarly, gamemasters can
punish troublesome player characters by penalizing them via
Karma Points. Penalized characters will have to shape up if they
ever want a chance of advancement in the future.
Take It Out on His/Her Contacts
Characters who frag off the wrong people may find that those
people decide to take out their anger on the character's friends,
contacts and even loved ones. Contacts are not going to continue to work with a character who spells such trouble, and any character with a shred of conscience should feel badly about bringing
trouble down on their friends and loved ones.
Take Away His/Her Toys
If a character's main problem is too many toys-cyber or
magical-the gamemaster can always take a few away.
Gamemasters can relieve characters of excess cyberware or magical gear in a number of ways. For example, certain authorities
might confiscate equipment-especially if the character is imprisoned. Alternatively, items can be stolen, disabled or simply suffer system failures. A character's Enemies may also destroy the
character's assets to deprive him or her of the advantages they
provide.
Give 'em What They Want
If a character really wants an outlandish advantage or toy, let
him or her have it-along with all of the trouble that comes with
owning it. Characters with exotic gear and other powerful advantages tend to attract powerful enemies. Additionally, a powerful
item or advantage can attract a continual stream of thieves,
ambushes and saboteurs, hopefully creating more trouble than
the item or advantage is worth.
MAINTAINING GAME BALANCE
Maintaining a balance between the power of player characters and their NPC opponents is one of the most important tasks
of the gamemaster. By keeping the NPC opponents slightly more
powerful than the player characters, the gamemaster forces the

player characters to rely on their brains and teamwork, rather than
simple firepower, to prevail. On the surface, maintaining such balance seems simple enough. However, the whole purpose of maintaining game balance is to keep play as fun as possible.
Consequently, the gamemaster must strive to maintain game balance in ways that don't reduce the fun of the game. In other
words. the gamemaster shouldn't sacrifice the players' freedom
to use all the cool weapons and spells available in Shadowrun and
also shouldn't simply create overpowering opponents whenever
it's convenient. Maintaining game balance and fun in a game
requires some thought on the gamemaster's part, but understanding a few basic principles can make it an easier, more
rewarding task.
Power Is Relative
The first principle to remember is that game balance is determined by the power of the player characters and the power of
their NPC opponents-not the power of one side alone. Instead of
denying your players a minigun for their starting characters, simply remind them that their opposition will also have minigunsand the enemy will probably have a slightly better version. The
player characters' opponents need not be so totally overpowering
that the runners never have a chance. They just need to be strong
enough to keep the player characters from easily defeating them.
As long as the opponents always challenge the runners, your
players eventually will realize that no matter how strong their
characters become, there will always be somebody bigger and
badder, someone with a bigger budget, better tech toys, older
and more experienced, with greater magical training and experience-someone they can't defeat in a straight-up fight.
Firepower Is Not Everything
Increasing the strength of NPC opponents is not the only way
to maintain game balance against power-hungry player groups
whose strength continues to grow. With a little imagination.
gamemasters can devise shadowruns and opponents that can't be
defeated using little more than firepower and combat spells-situations that force the player characters to use brains and teamwork.
For example. a Johnson might hire a team of runners for a run
where secrecy is of the utmost importance, a run that no one must
ever know about. Obviously, the team can't simply blow away
anyone and anything in its path-that would draw too much
attention. They'll have to come up with a strategy that gets them
to their goal with a minimum of fuss and muss.
Keep "Gamebreakers" Rare
"Gamebreakers" are pieces of equipment, spells, or other
items that can destroy game balance and "break" a game. What
constitutes a gamebreaker varies depending on the power levels
of a game or campaign. For example, even a submachine gun
might be a gamebreaker in a campaign full of gang members
armed with light pistols and baseball bats. The same gun would
be no big deal in a campaign full of folks packing assault rifles.
heavy machine guns and other heavy-duty goodies.
Keeping potential gamebreakers rare is the most effective
way to prevent such elements from ruining a game.
For example, consider the Panther assault cannon. The cannon's basic cost is a mere 7.200 nuyen, so most starting characters can buy a case of them-one for the den, the car, the bedroom and so on. Sounds like a game-balance disaster waiting to
happen, neh? But let's just say that the Panther is rare-not just
"no-starting-character-can-have-it" rare, but "no-one-has-seenone-or-really-knows-about-it" rare. Contacts scoff if you mention
the "magic gun." the so-called "Holy Grail of the street."
Suddenly, the "gamebreaker" no longer threatens game balance. Runners will have a hard time locating one. And if they do.
everyone's certainly going to notice them. In fact, people will be
screaming and running away or trying to cack them from behind
and steal the thing.
So by making the Panther rare, rather than forbidding the
players from obtaining one, the gamemaster has not restricted
their freedom. He hasn't reduced the "coolness" factor of the
weapon-it will still blow a hole through that Azzie hitman's
heavy body armor (as well as her body, the car parked behind her.
and the brick wall behind the car). He hasn't made the weapon
commonplace by equipping all the Lone Star cops with Panthers
to keep things even. But he's maintained game balance.
INCORPORATING DECKERS
Every Shadowrun group has probably experienced it at some
time. The decker goes off to do something in cyberspace and the
rest of the players go out for pizza or play a video game or simply
sit and chat while the gamemaster and the decker's player do their
thing. Though the new Matrix rules in Virtual Realities 2.0 speed
up decking in the game. they do not entirely solve the problem of
handling decker characters during the game. The following options
suggest ways to better integrate decking with the rest of the action
in a game and keep it from slowing things down.
NPC Deckers
NPC deckers enable gamemasters to dole out information for
a fee as needed. A gamemaster can quickly determine the results
of an NPC decker's Matrix run and report that information back to
the player characters. NPC deckers give gamemasters a great deal
of control over the information players acquire and greatly speed
things up, but they also greatly reduce the game opportunities
provided by the Matrix.
Two-Pronged Attack
In a two-pronged attack, the gamemaster plots two simultaneous shadowruns in which the decker goes online and works
"behind the scenes" to disable security measures and monitor the
progress of the run itself while the other characters do the physical work of the run. Published Shadowrun adventures and fiction
contain numerous examples of such runs,
Simultaneous Gamemastering
Under the simultaneous gamemastering approach. the
gamemaster works with the decker to play out the Matrix run and
guides the other characters through their own activities at the
same time. The gamemaster must switch between scenes quickly
enough to keep all the action moving, maintain dramatic tension

and keep the players busy, but this difficult task can be accomplished successfully with plenty of advance preparation.
Assistant Gamemaster
The gamemaster may also choose to appoint a player to be
the assistant gamemaster with the primary task of handling Matrix
runs with the decker's player. This arrangement frees the
gamemaster to devote his full attention to play with the rest of the
group. This approach requires some coordination between the
gamemaster and his assistant, but it works well for data runs that
are not directly connected with the action that the other characters are experiencing.
Solo Matrix Adventures
Gamemasters can conduct some Matrix runs as short solo
adventures for their decker characters before the main game session starts. In this case, the gamemaster simply uses the results
from those Matrix runs as they are needed during the main game.
This approach greatly speeds up play but may reduce the amount
of continuity between Matrix action and the rest of the game. For
example, a decker might learn something during the main game
session that would have affected his Matrix run that evening.
Computer Skill Test
In some cases, gamemasters can represent a Matrix run with
a single Computer Skill Test, modified by the effects of the decker's applicable programs. Gamemasters should use this option
sparingly, if possible, A player may become bored quite quickly if
his decker character never does anything other than make
Computer Tests.
AVOIDING INFORMATION OVERLOAD
Each new Shadowrun book that hits the shelves adds to the
vast amount of Shadowrun information already available.
Understandably, gamemasters and players often want to incorporate as much of this information as possible into their version of
the game, which can lead to "information overload" and bog
down play, Gamemasters and players simply may need to find a
way to narrow their focus and incorporate only the information
important to their campaigns at any given time. The following
suggestions are designed to aid this process.
Latest-and-Greatest Syndrome
The Sixth World is an incredibly rich setting that becomes richer with each successive Shadowrun book. Naturally, many
gamemasters and players want to use every new rule, weapon,
spell, opponent, setting or idea that comes along. However, doing
so can quickly turn a campaign into a long string of tricks, gimmicks and unconnected plots that don't really hold together.
Fortunately, gamemasters can avoid this pitfall and still satisfy their
players' and their own appetites for new ideas by simply exercising some patience and doing a little creative gamemastering.
Perhaps most important, gamemasters should consider carefully the appropriateness of any new idea based on the scope of
their campaign. their players' abilities, and the likely effects of the
new idea on their games. Not all options are well-suited for all
campaigns. Depending on the current direction, power level and
story line of his or her campaign, a gamemaster may want to
modify or even prohibit certain options. Remember, just because
an option has appeared in a FASA-published book does not mean
that the gamemaster has to allow it into his individual campaign.
All of the material in Shadowrun books, including the Shadowrun
Companion, are options for gamemasters-not required elements that gamemasters must use.
Rather than modifying or prohibiting new options, gamemasters may incorporate new material into their campaigns gradually.
For example, revolutions in bioware, cybertechnology or magical
research shouldn't happen overnight. Gradually adding innovations from sourcebooks such as the Grimoire, Shadowtech,
Cybertechnology, Virtual Realities 2.0 and Awakenings not only
mimics the dispersal of technological innovations in the real
world -- it provides the players and gamemasters time to adjust to
the new options. Additionally, gamemasters may prohibit starting
characters from using such options. This provides the gamemaster with greater control over the use of a new option.
THE SECRETS OF FASA
Occasionally. Shadowrun players and gamemasters complain that they just aren't getting the whole story behind every
new development in the Shadowrun universe. Well, it's true
FASA does have some secrets. But we have good reasons for
keeping those secrets.
Our continuing effort to keep the Shadowrun universe vital
and growing is the main reason for keeping some things to ourselves. To keep things fresh. we need to put out new material all
the time. Consequently, we have to hold some ideas back to
develop for future products. Additionally, we have to make sure
that each new idea fits with the existing universe. And finally, new
options-and your reaction to them-have a way of suggesting
even more directions for the universe. Given these factors, we
simply cannot fully describe every nook and cranny or completely explore every new direction in the game universe. That's why
no one will ever know everything about the continuing
Shadowrun saga.
Of course, this situation need not stop gamemasters from
creating their own unique twists on elements of the Sixth World.
Have a great plot line about the truth behind the Lone Eagle incident or the Crash of '29? Feel free to elaborate on it and use it in
your campaign. If it clashes with something published by FASA at
a later date, simply adjust the campaign or ignore the FASA concept or find a way to make the two stories meet somewhere in
between. We feel fairly confident, however, that FASA's story lines
and the story lines of Shadowrun gaming groups will rarely overlap in an inconvenient way. For example, sourcebooks such as
Portfolio of a Dragon provide a multitude of adventure and campaign plot hooks, and only a few of them will be explored in
future Shadowrun books-leaving plenty of room for gamemasters to play with the possibilities of the universe without worrying
about FASA stepping on their toes.
Don't limit the possibilities of your Shadowrun world by
hedging your bets against FASA's version of the universe.

T
he world of Shadowrun is rich and varied, but most players never get to see more than its
grimy underbelly. Spending all their time doing the corps' dirty work and trying to survive
on the mean streets, typical shadowrunners never get more than a glimpse of the larger
world they inhabit. Gamemasters who want to explore other aspects of the Shadowrun
universe, or players who simply want a change of pace, might consider running game sessions or even campaigns in which the characters are something other than shadowrunners.
These alternate campaigns follow pretty much the same rules as the Shadowrun you
know and love, with a few changes that reflect the different situations player characters
will face as cops, gang members and so on. This section briefly describes several non-runner campaign concepts, each outlined in the terms given in Keys to a Good Adventure,
p. 96. This material offers the gamemaster springboards for building new campaigns based on any
one of these themes, using the techniques outlined in this book. Though many of these concepts
take the campaign beyond the "shadowrunner team" and into other areas of the Sixth World, all
of them still focus on the unique blend of science fiction and fantasy elements that make
Shadowrun exciting.
WHERE DOES IT HURT?
Altruistic-minded players might want to try playing a DocWagon High Threat Response team.
Just think: all the dangers of shadowrunning, a regular salary and your own VTOL! This type of
campaign may appeal to players who want loads of action without a lot of setup-HTR teams only
get called in when the action is hot and heavy. Of course, there's a lot more to being a DocWagon
tech than pulling people out of dangerous situations-just watch any TV hospital drama for a
whole host of ideas.

HTA
DOC
CHARACTER CREATION
Create DocWagon PCs using standard Shadowrun rules, plus
the following guidelines as appropriate. The team should consist
of a rigger (to drive the ambulance, MedEvac chopper or other
appropriate vehicle); a mage or shaman for magical healing and
fire support (note that HTR shamans tend to be followers of Bear
and Snake because of the healing bonuses conferred by those
totems); one or two medical specialists who do most of the actual patching-up of victims; and additional fire support personnel
(anything from physical adepts to troll muscle to heavily cybered
combat specialists). Deckers don't usually come along for the ride;
they stay at the local headquarters and keep track of all the tactical information, as well as notifying local police, governments.
businesses and other services of what's going down. Other types
of characters with no knack for medicine or defensive combat will
have little place in this kind of campaign.
The gamemaster may rule that no DocWagon characters can
take Tech as Priority A or B during character creation, as DocWagon
will supply most of the team's non-Implanted equipment. (Besides,
anyone who can afford that kind of gear must be making a lot more
than DocWagon pays!) Each character should have a minimum
Biotech Skill Rating of 3; medical specialists should also have some
biology and/or cybertechnology
skills. Because HTR teams respond to
high-threat situations, combat skills
will also be useful, though the team
should be concerned about saving
the custom-um, patient first and
kicking hoop second.
For more details about
DocWagon HTR teams and their
equipment, see pp. 95-101 of The
Neo-Anarchist's Guide to Real Life.
ADVENTURE IDEAS
The daily duties of a DocWagon
HTR team involve rescuing badly
Injured DocWagon customers from
situations too dangerous for normal
medical teams. One obvious example is a firefight, wherein an innocent bystander or even a participant
with a DocWagon contract gets hit
and needs attention. Charging into a
gun battle is a dangerous proposition, particularly when Lone Star or
heavily armed shadowrunners get
involved, or when participants in
the fight might not want to see a
particular victim survive. In addition.
the gamemaster has numerous
ways of making things even more
interesting for the players. What if
the DocWagon customer is a shadowrunner, and the rest of his team
carries him along as they flee the
scene or continue with their run?
The HTR team is contractually obligated to help their customer,
and so may follow along and get mixed up in all kinds of shadowrunning mayhem.
Gun battles are not the only source of serious injury. Natural
disasters, terrorist activity, paranormal animal attacks-all of these
situations are prime candidates for an HTR team, and may put the
medics in as much danger as the patient. These types of scenarlos, where numerous lives are endangered, can also be used to
tweak the characters' consciences. If a terrorist bomb wounds fifty
people and only three are DocWagon customers, will the characters be able to make themselves ignore the other wounded while
performing their duties? Where does an employment contract
give way to conscience?
The HTR team's job will be complicated by the fact that they
are carrying huge amounts of drugs and extremely expensive
medical equipment, not to mention firearms, all of which makes
them prime targets for thieves. Particularly daring thieves have
been known to injure a DocWagon customer and then lay an
ambush for the HTR team. Though HTR teams are better equipped
to deal with such situations than the average paramedic squad,
they are by no means immune to disaster.

Finally, DocWagon player characters may well have to deal
with the problem of competing medical organizations. DocWagon
is the largest company of its kind, but by no means the only one,
and many smaller medical companies will try just about anything
to preserve their market share-including attacking DocWagon
teams if both companies respond to calls in the same area.
Theoretically, the first priority of DocWagon personnel is to insure
their customers' safety and health. But many DocWagon teamsespecially HTR teams-are more than willing to engage in "active
defense" against rival companies. As the legendary DocWagon
HTR pilot jim "Doc Croc" Crocker once put it. "The Hippocratic
oath don't apply to the competition."
CAMPAIGNING WITH DOCWAGON
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.
The Premise
Most DocWagon campaigns will be limited to a single city or
district that DocWagon services, though the characters can occasionally be "loaned out" to other DocWagon branches for training,
demonstration of new techniques and so forth. The gamemaster
can create some interesting variations by setting the campaign in
a place that offers other challenges than gunfights, such as a
MediCarro campaign in war-torn Aztlan or a DocWagon adventure in an uneasy border town like Denver.
Medics working for DocWagon aren't likely to be physical or
magical powerhouses. The characters should be competent at certain combat and self-defense skills as needed, but their primary
purpose is to save lives, not beat people to a pulp. The player of
such a character can channel the skill points and resources that he
might ordinarily have used to create a combat monster into additional medical and social skills and abilities that can help the character in his or her line of work.
The Goal
The player characters are members of an ambulance crew or
search-and-rescue team that gets sent out to help a variety of
people in need of medical attention, almost always in highly dangerous situations. The characters' first job is to see to the safety
and health of their patients-in this case to save lives, so the campaign should have a moral tone. The characters are doing difficult
and dangerous work for little or no reward (by the standards of
many people in the Sixth World) and so they must be devoted to
their jobs. Though DocWagon characters may get involved in the
shadier side of the medical business-organlegging, drug smuggling and so on-it makes for a better campaign if the characters
try to maintain the moral high ground. They may touch on the
problem of corruption while trying to root it out of their own organization, for example.
The life of the patient is the most important consideration.
Characters risk themselves to save lives because that's their job.
Sometimes they need to break rules to get that job done. And
sometimes you don't manage to save the victim-so you try
harder next time.
Opposition
Much of the opposition that characters face in this kind of
campaign will be natural, impersonal forces: disaster, fire, disease,
street warfare and so on. They might also have trouble with
groups or opponents likely to target a medical organization: ecoterrorists, ghouls, organ-smugglers, rival companies and, of
course, shadowrunners looking to heist a DocWagon vehicle for
cover (what shadowrunning team hasn't tried this at some
point?).
While a certain amount of violence might be permissible
when a DocWagon crew is trying to get to a client, that doesn't
mean the characters can blaze away at anyone in their path without having to answer to the law for it. Most of the violence likely
to occur in a DocWagon campaign will be after the fact; this gives
the players an interesting opportunity to see the frequently gory
results of a "simple" shadowrun. For example, an HTR team may
get called to a corporate site where a group of shadowrunners
have mowed through the guards and defenses; immediately on
arrival, the player characters must treat all the hapless guards who
are still alive. They might find a clue that could nail those lousy
shadowrunners, and they may well feel inclined to use it.
Complications
A search-and-rescue campaign allows the characters to go
into all kinds of dangerous and exciting situations with plenty of
backup at the home base. It also provides sanctions for highspeed vehicle action and last-minute saves, and can send a
refreshing breath of heroism into the darkness of the Sixth World;
for once the characters are helping people and saving lives rather
than grubbing up nuyen. The gamemaster should make each
DocWagon mission feel like a hour-long TV action drama.
On the other hand, heroic do-gooding may not be everyone's thing-especially for players who aren't interested in medicine. Adventures can sometimes become routine, and maintaining a variety of stories and opportunities for a DocWagon campaign is more difficult than for the standard shadowrunning game.
Players may be frustrated by the lack of combat, lower power level
or lack of financial reward for their heroism (though they should
net a fair amount of Karma to compensate).
In addition to the player characters, other important characters in a DocWagon campaign include the doctors and medical
personnel back at the hospital/clinic/home base, who may often
be in touch via the Matrix to offer assistance. Player characters
may also have to deal with company administrators, the local
authorities (police and others) and the occasional street doc or
healer whom the characters may befriend and help out on the sly
from time to time. A final complication is the person being rescued-how does he, she or it feel about it? Did DocWagon stop
an extraction team from taking the patient unwillingly, or did he
or she want to go with them? Has the patient become an employee without a corp? Did the patient get into trouble because he or
she intended to go out in a blaze of glory, and the DocWagon
team prevented a spectacular suicide? Did someone set up the
patient to be murdered? The patient alone can lead to multiple
adventures for the rescuers.

SMILE, YOU'RE ON CAMERA!
In the 2050s, information is the purest kind of power.
Therefore, corporations and governments spend a great deal of
time and money attempting to keep it to themselves. But one
group exists that is dedicated to taking information from the
Powers That Be and giving it to the common man-the news
media. Much like today, the media hounds of the 2050s are the
ones who dig up the skeletons in the closets of the rich and powerful or shed light on the secrets that the megacorps don't want
anyone to know. It's a dirty job, but somebody has to do it-why
not your players?
Most of the big media outfits in Shadowrun are controlled
secretly or openly by the megacorps, and so the characters will
probably be working for the bit players. They may be from a pirate
trid station, stealing bandwidth from authorized stations to broadcast their sound bites and fleeing before security shows up. Or
maybe they're stringers, scrabbling for anything newsworthy and
selling it to the highest bidder. Or they may work for a small local
station with a shoestring budget, fighting off hostile takeovers while
broadcasting the news that the major studios can't or won't touch.
CHARACTER CREATION
You can create newshound characters with the standard
Shadowrun rules or the optional rules in Character Creation
(beginning on p. 10). Players should also keep the following
guidelines in mind. A pirate trid station would definitely need a
decker/electronics expert to wire up their broadcasting equipment to override legitimate media traffic. In fact, a decker's unparallelled ability to track down data and uncover hidden information
makes him or her especially useful in any media-related campaign. Unless the team works solely for the datafaxes, they will
want at least one high-Charisma "face" person to make the actual
broadcasts. The rest of the team can be camera people, technicians and security people, all of whom will surely have other talents they can use to keep the team alive and effective. Combat
skills may not be the team's first priority, but newshound characters should definitely have them: uncovering corruption in the
megacorps and governments of the Sixth World is a good way to
get dead if you can't defend yourself. Mage characters can be useful to a news team if they have masking, invisibility and other
"stealth" spells. A good rigger, who can get you the heck out of
trouble when the drek goes down, is also an asset.
Anyone who might appear on camera or have to deal oneon-one with sources should definitely have high Charisma: in
addition, good Etiquette and Negotiation skills are crucial when
tracking down leads, Stealth is also handy when trying to surreptitiously record scandalous meetings or covert operations, and
Interrogation is great for hitting those corporate mouthpieces with
a barrage of revealing, rapid-fire questions. But the most crucial
part of a newshound character is his contacts. A newshound
should have plenty, from as many different walks of life as possible to give him or her the best leads fast.
ADVENTURE IDEAS
News media adventures can start from almost any premise:
an overheard conversation. an anonymous tip or the reporter's
ever-popular "gut feeling." Any sign of corporate cruelty, government cover-ups, shadowrunning activity or other ratings-grabbers
will surely draw reporters like flies on drek.
In most media campaigns, the characters' primary goal is to
get incriminating evidence on film, then broadcast it so that the
public at large knows about the dirty deeds being done. Whether
that means following chemical tankers as they dump toxic wastes
on a wildlife preserve or recording a meeting between a mayoral
candidate and a Mafia don, these jobs will require excellent investigative skills, subtlety, stealth and (if discovered) the ability to flee
at high speed. Of course, broadcasting the story doesn't end the
adventure; the megacorps and other powerful miscreants are not
known for their "live and let live" attitude toward those who
reveal their dirty laundry to the public. The characters must either
maintain a high profile and hope that the targets of their exposés
won't dare take action against them, or drop out of sight until the
heat cools off.
If the characters develop a large public following, an
unscrupulous corporation (pretty much all of them) might
decide to use the characters to frame an appropriate victim.
With an "anonymous tip," the corp puts the characters on the
target's trail and then uses illusion magic, disguises or high-tech
trickery (whatever is at their disposal) to give the characters
"proof" that the target is doing something shady. The characters
take the bait, the target is publicly crucified, and if the frame-up
job comes out it'll be up to the characters to prove they were
Innocent dupes instead of co-conspirators. (And even proving
that has its price-what media hound really wants the public to
know he can be fooled?)
The characters may also occasionally be hired by shadowrunners who are investigating some manner of coverup and want
concrete proof of their findings. An interesting way to use this
type of adventure is to have the runners alert the news team of
their suspicions, then get mercilessly slaughtered as they commence their investigation. Now the newsies are the only people
who know the deadly secret that the corp (or whoever) is hiding.
and they must decide whether or not to risk their lives by taking
up where the dead runners left off.
Finally, a gamemaster who wants to get his players involved
with the Sixth World's real movers and shakers can use the scenario described in KSAF, p. 45 in the Threats sourcebook. An
unknown source constantly sends the characters clues to major
news events that are about to happen, giving them just enough
time to arrive on the scene and record the historic happenings.
The characters may wind up covering a lot of things that the
Powers That Be prefer to be forgotten, and any number of people
will wonder where the characters get their information-including
the characters themselves! This premise could be the basis for an
interesting, high-action campaign that reaches its climax when
the characters finally think they've figured out who their source is
(and then must decide what to do about it).
CAMPAIGNING WITH MEDIA TEAMS
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section. p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.

The Premise
The player characters are all part of a team working for a
major or pirate media network, or else they are freelance news
hounds. They specialize in handling the hot stories that often put
them in the line of fire: they also dig up the dirt on the world's
megacorporations and governments, often information that these
powers do not want broadcast. The pirate news station KSAF.
described in the Threats sourcebook, makes a useful basis for this
type of campaign: plenty of the information in the Shadowbeat
sourcebook is also appropriate to running a media-based game.
This type of campaign can vary greatly in scale depending on
the desires of your players. A news team might confine most of
its reporting to a single metroplex, or the team might travel all
over the world to track down the hot news and top stories.
Generally, the larger the news organization for which the characters work, the more influence their stories will have (and the correspondingly greater risks they must take to get the story out).
This type of campaign can take place in a wide variety of settings. The player characters can go anywhere a potential news
story may break, from corporate boardrooms to the harsh back
alleys of the Barrens and more.
The Goal
It is possible to uncover the truth. The public has a right to be
Informed, and information must be free-especially in the Sixth
World, where control of information means control over people's
lives. Many people in power prefer to conceal their activities from
the media's eye, or want to distort the truth for their own ends.
Reporters must therefore remain objective, but also must always
struggle with the Powers That Be to get their stories out.
The moral questions of a media campaign can range far
beyond the simple issues of mercenary work and violence. The
player characters must make decisions about what types of stories
they will cover and how. Because so much of the media in the
Sixth World is censored by government or corporate owners, the
characters will have to deal with the consequences of that censorship in one way or another-working with a pirate network or
within the structure of an existing "legit" network. A media campaign, which gives player characters a chance to influence events
through their reporting, can have an entirely different tone from
the typical shadowrunning game. Gamers Interested in the complex, behind-the-scenes plots of the Sixth World will find a media
campaign an interesting opportunity to explore those kinds of
stories. Conspiracy and investigation buffs can have a lot of fun,
and the gamemaster can also give the characters a chance to hobnob with some of the major players of the Shadowrun universe.
Few media hounds are physical or magical powerhouses. A
media character's power lies in entirely different directions than
that of most shadowrunners: information and influence. A talented and respected reporter character can wield considerable power
without having wired reflexes or a massive Combat Pool. Though
newshound characters are likely to need some combat skills and
abilities to handle the dangerous situations they will tend to
encounter, a media campaign is likely to be less combat-oriented
than most other campaigns in Shadowrun.
Opposition
The major antagonists for a media campaign are rival news
organizations working to get the best stories and information first,
and the people who don't want their affairs exposed by a bunch
of pushy newshounds. The characters can easily fall into a situation where they know too much to be allowed to live, much less
report what they know. The Dragon's Last Dance, pp. 11-20 of
Portfolio of a Dragon, highlights some of the hazards that media
characters face every day.
Though reporter characters are likely to cover violent incidents,
they rarely engage in violence themselves. Most media teams will
use violence only in self-defense, and any group as subject to dealing with the authorities as a local news team must answer for any
violent acts they commit. Media characters must therefore carefully consider the actions they intend to take. In a media-team campaign, the pen is often truly mightier than the sword.
Complications
An investigative media-based campaign can be frustrating to
players who are looking for combat action. The restrictions under
which a media team must operate are vastly different from the
"ground rules" that apply to a typical group of shadowrunners.
and some players might find working (mostly) within the law a
serious cramp in their style. There is also the danger that the
reporter character or characters might overshadow the other supporting characters in the campaign. To avoid this, the gamemaster should flesh out various NPCs that the player characters will
work with-the news team's editor or producer and the workings
of the player characters' network should be described in detail.
The gamemaster should also flesh out all the newshounds' contacts and informants, as well as the important people that the
player characters might be interested in investigating. A media
campaign requires a proactive gamemaster who is willing to let
the mystery unfold over the course of the game.
TRAINED TO BE GHOSTS
Most countries have an elite group within their militaries who
go through rigorous screening and training programs to become
the top-secret arm of the government assigned to taking on the
missions that are too weird, too dangerous or too controversial to
perform openly. These special-forces characters spy on others,
steal or copy confidential data, eliminate key problems, blow stuff
up, help "freedom fighters" and assassinate national leaders of
questionable morality. Sound familiar?
Special forces are essentially the government's topnotch
shadowrunners. They perform many of the same functions for
largely the same reasons as the ordinary street runner performs
for the corps. They are officially employed and so are not quite as
deniable as the average runner if something goes wrong, but their
training ensures that what they lose in deniability they make up in
talent and loyalty.
CHARACTER CREATION
Create special-forces characters according to the standard
rules, but do not use the optional rules for Enemies (p. 71).
Though special-forces characters can certainly create Enemies by

the dozen during game play, having a lot of money or cyberware
is not enough to make people kill you automatically in the real
world. Special-forces characters can also ignore the Availability
optional rule when procuring weapons and armor. The characters
are on their government's tab; if the mission requires a Panther
assault cannon, the taxpayers make sure that the characters have
one. (On the other hand, getting BTLs on a military base can be
tough.) The characters' two free contacts are automatically their
commanding officer and quartermaster (the person who manages their equipment). Any additional contacts must be purchased. Characters will also receive an annual wage of 75,000
nuyen-enough for a Medium Lifestyle and some extras.
Obviously. the Sixth World's governments need all types of
shadowrunners from deckers to riggers to muscleboys, and most
will hire all types of metahumanity. Possible exceptions are governments of a specific race-for example, the elven nation of Tir
Tairngire, whose members prefer to hire their fellow elves whenever possible (though they might find trolls and orks perfectly
acceptable as cannon fodder).
ADVENTURE IDEAS
Military campaigns can involve regular soldiers, but special
forces are the type of character closest to shadowrunners. They
work in small units and are extremely well-equipped; for example. a government will actually spend a million nuyen on a special-forces operative to make him the ultimate cybered machine,
as opposed to a regular soldier who gets a smartgun link and an
armored jacket. Finally, special forces are required to keep their
operations classified.
Gaming groups are likely to know and want to use varying
levels of detail about special forces. As an example of a typical
special-forces team, a UCAS Delta Force twelve-man "A-Team" is
commanded by a captain (CPT) who changes every three years:
the rest of the team stays together for life. The second-In-command is the Chief Warrant Officer (CWO). This character must at
some point have been a non-commissioned officer (NCO) with
one of the following specialties: Operations and Intelligence,
Medical Technician, Communications Technician, Weapons
Specialist, or Demolitions Specialist. Magic is considered a subset
of these specialities, depending on its use. The rest of the team
are non-commissioned officers.
Each team will have as its senior NCO a Master Sergeant
(MSG-E-8). This character is the Operations and Intelligence specialist who gets his hands on the required intelligence to plan the
mission. The Sergeants-First Class (SFC E-7) are a well-trained
medical technician and a demolitions expert. The medic is qualified to perform certain types of surgery and authorized to carry
controlled narcotics for medical purposes. The demolitions expert
can use all known forms of explosives, whether manufactured or
improvised. and usually carries any such materiel on a mission.
Staff Sergeants (SSG E-6) include the communications officer.
who knows how to operate his own and the enemy's communications equipment. He can also create communicators of some
kind from whatever happens to be handy. Another SSG is the
weapons specialist, trained in the use of almost all known light or
medium weapons. This officer should be able to use field artillery
and even tanks if necessary. The remainder of the team are additional Staff Sergeants and Sergeants (SGT E-5). All of the specialties described are suggestions for assigning skills, histories and
appropriate equipment to various characters: none of these provide a game bonus unless the gamemaster chooses to assign such
an advantage. Before embarking on any mission, the special
forces personnel are isolated for at least three days.
Special-forces missions often involve travel, frequently to
hostile nations where the characters carry out threats and assassinations or aid rebellious freedom fighters. Characters can also perform intelligence-gathering missions, datasteals, interrogations
and spy missions against foreign governments or against "undesirables" in their own country. They can function as an elite unit
sent to handle the most dangerous jobs during a war, or perform
the ever-popular mission where "something weird happened to
the last group we sent in, and you've got to stop whatever's
going on.
CAMPAIGNING WITH SPECIAL FORCES
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.
The Premise
A special-forces campaign resembles a regular shadowrunbut with certain important differences. Most special-forces campaigns will not be centered around legwork-special forces are
trained to act decisively, not chase clues around-and so contacts
become a less important aspect of the game. The characters will
have the same "Mr. Johnson" every time-their commanding offlcer-and they must cultivate his trust and respect in order to stay
on the team. If the gamemaster wants to start the characters out
in boot camp and roleplay their selection and training, that can
significantly intensify the relationship with their CO.
The Goal
When playing a special-forces game, emphasize the characters" loyalty to their country. That country need not be the UCAS;
imagine a Tir Ghosts or Sioux Wildcats campaign. The characters
are not freelancers: though they do get paid for their work, they
should do it primarily out of patriotism and loyalty. They must succeed in their missions at all costs and they rarely have any input
into their orders. To a special-forces character. the job is an honor
and the goal is to succeed for the glory or well-being of his country. If a character doesn't want to play that game, he or she should
leave for the more lucrative life of a shadowrunner.
Opposition
The opposition for any special-forces team is likely to be
another special-forces team: an opposing government's hit
squad, corporate security on red alert. or even freelancers out to
make a name for themselves. Terrorists also make excellent villians for a special-forces campaign. For less military, more spy-oriented missions, the primary "opposition" may be the sheer difficulty of infiltrating the target area or organization and then getting
out alive. These missions are extremely dangerous for many reasons: they are usually long-term, an agent involved in one may
well go "over the wall" and join the other side, or the agent may
get caught and simply disappear.
Complications
Special-forces characters must learn to work together. Unlike
ordinary shadowrunners, they cannot choose whom to work with
or kill a teammate they dislike. This arrangement can be good for
group harmony as players learn to work out in-character differences. The characters must also concentrate on teamwork to make
sure their missions stay secret. If they are ordered to assassinate
a dictator and they hose it, they can't just pack up and run the way
a shadowrunner often can. They must answer to the rest of their
unit and their government.
Also, military/special-forces characters are more likely to
have normal lives than shadowrunners. Such characters may
have spouses, children, parents and siblings whom they talk to
and care about, or friends outside the military. Gamemasters
should take this element of their player characters' lives into
account when the campaign needs a change of pace. For example. if characters are used to calling the President for the mission
plan and necessary equipment, they might have to think hard
about what to do when they hear from an old friend who needs
their help because he's gotten on the wrong side of the Mob.
They have the skills to accomplish what needs to be done. but
the necessity of operating outside their orders might force them
to reevaluate their careers in terms of their dedication to country
or to family. They would also need to decide whether to operate
outside the sanctions of the government, ask their superior officer for help. "borrow" equipment from the "office," and other
moral dilemmas.
I AM THE LAW
Playing corporate security or police officers, whether from
Lone Star. Knight Errant or smaller outfits, offers players a different look at the Sixth World. In many ways these characters resemble shadowrunners; they have many of the same skills and abillties, some of the same interests, and often the same functions.
Both types of teams include varied characters-deckers, magicians and combat-types-and get involved every day in the
down-and-dirty. take-your-life-in-your-hands aspect of the Sixth
World. And security specialists or law enforcement characters live
with almost the same level of danger as shadowrunners-in fact.
they're the ones that the runners come after. There are some significant differences, however. For one thing, corporate guards and
cops spend more time on intra-corp competition, bragging to
improve their reputations and actively soliciting the interesting
jobs. No one wants to go from being one of Knight Errant's golden boys this week to elementary-school lunch duty next week
because a rival spread jealous rumors.
CHARACTER CREATION
Creating cop and corporate-security characters is a little different than creating runners. To reflect the extent of corporate and
law-enforcement discrimination, metahuman characters should be
exceedingly rare-usually no more than one in any group.
Among the few metahumans, elves and dwarfs are more common than trolls and orks. Skills must be at least C priority. reflecting the fact that the characters have had training, and each character must have at least two Knowledge Skills to reflect the fact
that they've had some sort of education. If you are using the
point-based system (pp. 20-21) to create your character, you
must allocate 24 points to Skills. Corporate/cop characters also
automatically receive one of the following Edges at the standard
cost: Technical School, High School or College Education. As
CorpSec personnel and Lone Star cops, the player characters
should make a high enough salary to maintain a Medium Lifestyle.
Unlike shadowrunners, for whom a wide variety of specialties
on a team is necessary, cops and corp security are more likely to
work in one field. For example, everybody might play deckers
who are Fuchi's front line of defense for a campaign set entirely in
the Matrix. If all your players want to play magical characters, they
may be the "point team" for astral defense at the local Lone Star's
magical division.
Cop and corporate-security characters should have at least
two Enemies at character creation. One should be a Rank 1
Enemy, the other Rank 2. The characters' two free contacts must
be employees of their corporation or fellow cops at their precinct.
Purchased contacts may be of any type.
ADVENTURE IDEAS
Cop and corporate-security campaigns offer opportunities for
more roleplaying and social interaction than the average shadowrun. Characters must work reasonably within the law, and so
will almost always try to solve things by talking before resorting
to violence. Despite Lone Star's brutal trid image, any cop who
consistently shoots before speaking will find himself in court or on
the streets pretty quickly. Cop and corporate-security characters
also have to work within a corporate structure, answering to higher-ups, working together or competing with contemporaries and
mentoring newbies. This offers opportunities for social Interaction
beyond contacts from whom characters get weapons and information, and also for enemies who subtly attack a character's
career and ego rather than his physical person.
When running cop/corp campaigns, keep in mind that when
the dangerous drek goes down, the first thing most cops do is call
for backup. This action may be realistic, but it isn't much fun for
the players to know that their characters will always have fifty fellow cops ready to cover them should they screw up. The
gamemaster must make sure that the characters can get into highsuspense situations where a lot depends on a few moves made
only by the protagonists. In other words, look more to cop movies
for inspiration than to "real-world" police operations. Encourage
characters to have moral codes, doing the right thing even if the
chief has been bribed to look the other way, or to use their contacts and skills to help a group on the side of "good" but not on
the side of the law (metahuman rights, ecoterrorists and so on).
Another technique is the "nobody ever goes in or comes out"
ploy. The characters may not be able to call for backup for some
reason-for example, they've been kidnapped and their radios
taken, or they're inside a barrier like the Bug City containment
zone. Alternatively, backup may not be able to reach them-terrorists may control of the building they're in, or they started
exploring some mysterious sewer tunnels and now they don't
know where they are. Techniques like these put the story Into the
hands of the player characters, making for a more exciting and
memorable game.
The cop character has an ambiguous relationship with the
streets. He or she may have come from there, his or her most
interesting work takes place there, and yet the people of the
streets most likely despise and fear the cop. Nonetheless, cops
must be able to work with people in the shadows. When conducting an investigation, having contacts is as helpful for cops as
for shadowrunners. Cops tend to use their contacts much more
actively to "get a feel" for what's happening on the street. The
Negotiation rules (Spilling the Beans, p. 69) can make these
interviews interesting. Some contacts may also have a hold over
the character: for example, a yakuza oyabun who helps a cop out
with the occasional bit of information may successfully blackmail
that same cop to open a smuggling channel into a local prison.
When running a cop campaign, the gamemaster should have
a plausible reason for involving a small group of people rather
than a large team. Creating specialty teams or SWAT teams is one
way to do this: having a big event occur elsewhere that drains all
the NPCs away so that the player characters are the only ones left
is another. This type of campaign also works well If you have a
very small group of players (1-3) and would like to run an intimate
game that requires a lot of investigation rather than combat.
Corporate security functions in the same way as cops for the
most part, save that they have an even more limited range of
operations. Most often they stay on the grounds of their parent
corp. To keep the game varied, consider sending CorpSec characters on undercover missions or varying the types of security crises
(a gang attack, an assault by chromed-to-the-teeth or magically
powerful runners, an internal-affairs investigation, a rampage by
wild paranormal animals, a wageslave gone postal and so on).
You can also create campaigns around personal friendships and
enmities, or have the characters inadvertently uncover their corp's
dirty secrets. Starting out with characters who work for
Aztechnology with no idea of its reputation, then having them
stumble over increasingly clear evidence of blood magic and sacrifices, can lead up to an emotional climax as the characters
decide whether to continue working for the corp they now know
is evil or risk everything they have to do what is right. (If they
leave, of course, they can go directly to traditional Shadowrun.)
Corporate characters often have shaky relationships with their
street contacts. Most often they are either bribing the contact for
information-and they'd better keep up the payments in the
game or suffer the consequences-or they are personal friends
from before the corp character went legit, in which case the character must consider how deeply he or she wants to drag a friend
into trouble.
Corp/cop adventures do not center around making money,
and characters can't really steal and/or loot bodies because they
have no access to a black market at which to sell their pickings.
An easy way to make the campaign tougher is to slash the corporate or precinct budget: this means the characters may not be
able to get their hands on the best equipment, or even equipment
that works, and they may also not have the cash to grease all the
palms that need it. As with special-forces campaigns, corporate
and cop characters are more likely to have normal lives than shadowrunners. If a character's whole family is tied up with the corporation, might he or she think twice about leaving after finding out
about Aztechnology's evil experiments? Or if a cop spends
months tracking down some piece of shadowrunner scum only to
find out that the runner is her little sister who ran away two years
ago, how will she react to that discovery?
Going Undercover
An adventure in which an individual or group must go undercover is difficult to pull off and poses some obvious problems,
such as the short life expectancy of an undercover character if his
or her cover is broken. Also, the gamemaster must create a complete undercover environment for the character or the group.
Finally, an undercover adventure is likely to be high on social skills
and sweet talking, and low on combat action. If well-roleplayed.
however, an undercover campaign can create an interesting story
and loads of opportunity for character interaction.
When playing an undercover character, design him or her as
if the character actually is the person he is disguised as (shadowrunner, organized-crime member, gang member). The character must also have a Skill Rating of at least 3 in Corporate (Police)
Etiquette and the type of Etiquette most needed to succeed at his
or her undercover profession.
If the players are willing to risk it, an undercover campaign
can lead to some intense and memorable scenes when a character's cover is broken and he must break the law in order to prove
his loyalty to his new bosses. A super twist is to have an undercover cop be a member of a shadowrunning team. Keep in mind
that no matter how well the character plays his or her runner
role-or even if the character decides he prefers his runner buddies to being a cop and ultimately takes to the street himselfother players and their characters don't like feeling foolish. When
the character's cover is broken, as it will be eventually, that character will have to do some quick and convincing talking to stay
alive, and even then the enraged runners may kill the character
out of spite.
CAMPAIGNING WITH THE LAW
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.
The Premise
The characters are trying to hang on to the moral high ground
in a world of chaos. They stick to the ideal of the law. if not always
the letter of it, and must often face corruption in their own organization. This premise makes an interesting change from most
campaigns, where the characters are "criminal scum" (shadowrunners): cop characters might even find themselves outsmartIng and hauling in a few shadowrunners from time to time!
Law enforcement characters try to uphold the ideals of "good
cops" and deal with crime and corruption in their jurisdiction as
well as within their organization. The player characters are members of a single crime squad, or perhaps an elite unit such as a
Lone Star Fast Response Team. They work together all the time,
and form the kind of bonds that people only form with those who
save their necks on a regular basis; there are no loners in a cop
squad. The unit may include magicians and adepts as magical
support, though such characters must answer to the magical specialty division of the organization for which the characters work.
Most cop squads also include a decker to provide needed technical support.
The characters work in a distinct locale, dealing with criminal
activity in their particular city or precinct if they're cops and keeping tabs on the corporate site to which they've been assigned if
they're CorpSec. Though they may have to deal with their company's or organization's home office at times, most of their attention is confined to the local area.
Cop/corp campaigns lend themselves to any good-sized city
or metroplex like Seattle. The gamemaster can create some interesting variations by choosing cities outside the UCAS or CAS and
focusing on those cities' unique aspects and problems, such as
Los Angeles, Denver, Vancouver (in Salish-Shiche) and Portland
(in Tir Tairngire).
The Goal
To a cop character, being a "good cop" is the most important
thing in the world. Without good people to uphold the law, anarchy reigns and people get hurt. There is nothing worse than a bad
cop, because a bad cop corrupts the law. People deserve protection from crime, and so sometimes you have to bend the rules a
little to put criminals away. But you can't bend the rules too much,
even if sometimes that means letting the bad guys go. Cop and
CorpSec characters have an immediate reason for working together and clearly set goals for dealing with criminal scum; they also
have enough leeway to act on their own initiative. They have
fewer worries about getting gear than the average shadowrunner
character, and the gamemaster has more control over character
advancement. The cop/corp campaign shows players "the other
side of the street" and lets them be on the side of Law and Order
for a change.
Opposition
The player characters have plenty of ready-made opponents
In the criminal element with which they must deal daily.
Organized crime offers quite a few powerful adversaries: the characters are also likely to tangle with small-time criminals such as
gangs, smugglers, gamblers, con artists and shadowrunners.
Other interesting opposition may be corruption within the
characters' organization or precinct. Bad cops, corrupt political
officials, political pressure from higher-ups and the like can be
much more difficult for the characters to fight than simple street
scum. Cop characters might also have trouble from rival police or
security organizations, especially if a contract dispute is going on
or some other company wants to muscle in on the police business
in the player characters' city.
The campaign is likely to see plenty of violence with characters who work the mean streets every day, but the mayhem is of
a different kind than most shadowrunners encounter. Cops are
bound by the law and company regulations about the use of
deadly force; sensational trid stories to the contrary, they should
never deal with a problem by shooting first and asking questions
later. Cop and CorpSec characters will have the advantage of the
best modern weapons and armor that nuyen can buy (unless their
department is underfunded, as many are); however, they should
still be careful. Shadowrunners can be tricky opponents, after all.
Complications
Some players may find the rules and restrictions of working
in a police organization-especially the limits in equipment and
advancement-too constricting. Certain "square peg" character
types such as shamans might have a tough time fitting into the
campaign. Also, the players can become complacent and lazy if all
their characters' activities are dictated by their superior officers.
Unless the characters are part of an elite group like an FRT.
they probably aren't cyber-gods or Nth-grade initiates; they're
most likely just ordinary cops trying to do their job. The characters
have the advantages of professional training and whatever backing and equipment their organization provides, so they shouldn't
have to worry much about scrounging for gear unless they want
something that isn't regulation.
Magician characters will have free access to the organization's magical equipment and resources, and may also have an inhouse initiate group to teach them the higher mysteries at some
future point. Decker characters will have the chance to play with
a number of systems legitimately (for a change), and they also
have free access to their own organization's hi-tech systems.
The company rules and regulations offer a plausible rationale for the gamemaster to control character advancement and
any new cyber or magical abilities that players want their characters to acquire.
As a general rule, the player characters stay in one area most
of the time, leaving only when transferred to a different unit.
However, such transfers may be as frequent as the gamemaster
desires. Corp security teams come up for review fairly often in the
fast-paced economy of the Awakened world, and so player-character teams could be transferred to anywhere in the world. They may
be ordered to shore up existing security, request a transfer upon
realizing that their superiors are corrupt or inefficient, or arrange for
their own disappearance to another corp or the shadows.
DOUBLE, DOUBLE TOIL AND TROUBLE
The magical campaign puts an interesting twist on a
Shadowrun game because it revolves around encounters with.
research into and exploration of the eerie and often formidable
mystic powers of the Awakened world. From uncovering the truth
behind Aztechnology to discovering the real purpose of the
Atlantean Foundation or the ultimate scheme of the Illuminates of
the New Dawn, magical investigations have an otherworldy feel
that players may find appealing. Less like shadowrunners and more.
like scholarly investigators, characters in a magical campaign face all
kinds of dangers-especially the fear of the unknown.

CHARACTER CREATION
Most or all of the player characters in a magical campaign
should have some kind of magical ability, though the occasional
mundane character can be added to make things interesting. This
type of campaign works best if all the player characters are members of the same magical order or lodge or other initiatory group:
this automatically gives them a history together and will likely
give them a goal as well. Many of the characters' activities must
remain hidden in order to conceal the order's secrets from mundane humanity. The group may work toward the goals of their
order, lodge, government or organization, or may work against
another organization. The magical campaign offers a perfect
opportunity to use the adept characters that appear in many
Shadowrun products.
A magical campaign can be more aggressive on all levels if
its members are working for someone else, preferably a powerful
backer. In this case, not all the team members need be magically
active. The Atlantean Foundation's Mystic Crusaders (p. 58,
Threats) are an excellent organization for this type of campaign,
as is the Dunkelzahn Institute for Magical Research (p. 25,
Portfolio of a Dragon).
ADVENTURE IDEAS
The world of Shadowrun is full of magical sites, items, people, creatures, spirits and organizations. Most are secret: some
are so secret that the only evidence of their existence is the occasional whispered rumor. A magical campaign can easily take on
the feel of a regular shadowrun-for example, sneaking into the
local Aztechnology facility to find out what magical research is
going on there. Others may feel like an archaeological expedition-such as investigating a power site, mana line or magical
anomaly like the Mojave Desert. Still other adventures may cast
the player characters as astral investigators looking into the metaplanes. And of course, an ongoing covert war against another
magical group or society is always a good adventure hook.
CAMPAIGNING WITH MAGIC
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.
The Premise
Characters in a magical campaign travel wherever they must
for their work. They might hit the Bermuda Triangle one week,
Egypt the next and Glastonbury. England the week after that. This
type of campaign lets the gamemaster offer a wide variety of
exotic and magical settings for adventures, but also makes it
extremely important for the characters to have a stable "home
base" with their organization so that they can deal with regular
recurring NPCs.
Magicans as a group tend to feel that they have a greater stake
in the workings of the universe because magic is neither good nor
bad-that judgment applies only to specific uses of it. And "bad
magic" is almost always very, very bad. Therefore, magical campaigns tend to be large-scale, with far-reaching implications for at
least the characters' magical order and possibly even the world.
The Goal
This type of campaign is ideal for players who want to
explore different aspects of magic in the Sixth World, including
the metaplanes and the many different types of spirits and paranormal critters. It also offers the chance to use different exotic
locations. The tone of a magical campaign is open to interpretation, but assumes that the player characters are all seeking knowledge and truth (however they define it) and have plans for using
that knowledge. If the players can handle the complexity, their
group might even have a mixture of goals and motivations. Some
characters might seek knowledge for its own sake, some might be
looking for magical power, and others may be seeking to protect
mundane humanity from various magical threats.
The moral tone of the campaign, whatever it may be. can be
strongly expressed through the strictures of the magical group to
which the characters belong (p. 54, Grimoire). This set-up gives
the campaign some added weight because a character who violates too many strictures can be expelled from the order. If this
happens, the character would most likely have to leave the group.
Opposition
The major opponents characters are likely to face in this type of
campaign are members of rival magical orders. Knowledge is
power, and magicians seek knowledge above all else. Rival groups
working at cross purposes may contend with each other to get their
hands on some valuable magical lore, or to snatch a hidden magical treasure from some ancient site or ruin. Groups like the
Illuminates of the New Dawn. Aztlan blood mages, the Black
Lodge, Winternight and the Atlantean Foundation are all possible
rivals for the player characters (for more information on these
groups, see Threats and Portfolio of a Dragon). Individual magicians such as toxic shamans can also provide hefty challenges.
Other major antagonists for a magical order are powerful
spirits: free spirits, insect spirits and even the mysterious Enemy.
if the gamemaster so desires. The free spirit Tutor (p. 92, Threats)
makes an excellent opponent, as do many of the other magical
enemies described in that sourcebook.
Though the magical campaign is primarily investigative, it has
the potential for some truly spectacular magical battles, as well as
grand-scale physical conflict on the astral plane and the metaplanes. Mundane characters may be most useful in this type of
campaign as bodyguards for the less brawny magicians in the
group. If desired, the characters might be members of a physically-oriented organization, such as a martial arts dojo. Such a campaign would be well-suited for physical adept and physical magician characters (see p. 119, Awakenings).
Complications
The campaign's focus on magic can be its greatest weakness
as well as its greatest strength. For players not especially interested in magic, a magical campaign can quickly grow tiresome. Also,
a magical campaign's narrow focus can tend to make all the player characters seem the same; they all know the same spells, have
similar magical skills, and so on. To avoid this pitfall, the
gamemaster should encourage players to create more specialized
characters than a typical Shadowrun magician.

Player characters are likely to develop considerable magical
power as the campaign progresses, and so gamemasters are
advised to keep a close eye on how characters spend their Karma
for advancement. Remind your players that non-magical skills and
abilities are useful in various situations, and encourage the players
to buy them. The gamemaster may also wish to set an upper limit
on magical skills such as sorcery and conjuring so that no character grows out of control.
THIS IS OUR TURF, MEAT
Shadowrun makes an ideal environment for a gang campaign.
This type of campaign allows players to play characters who don't
have it all under control. They're just above squatters on the food
chain and have to fight for every inch of ground they get. They can't
fight without thought because there are predators a lot bigger and
meaner than they are on the streets. So if gang characters want to
survive, they have to think. A last-resort home of sorts for people
who've been used and abused by the system, a gang is a social
club, shadowrunning group, terrorist organization and law enforcement (of a sort) for their home turf. Usually led by a charismatic
leader, gangers tend to belong to disenfranchised groups: racial,
ethnic or economic. They band together and form mini-societies
with their own rules, attitudes, prejudices and goals.
A gang campaign offers an immediate means of getting a
group of characters together and keeping them that way by forging bonds of cooperation and loyalty between them. The campaign also allows for a lower power level so that the players and
gamemaster can concentrate on character development and personal interaction rather than simply accumulating various toys.
The following campaign notes apply to small neighborhood
or area gangs, not city-wide or national forces.
GANG CREATION
Forming a gang gives outcast individuals the protection of
numbers and the advantage (physical and psychological) of backup when on the offensive. They also provide the only way for a
shadowrunner wannabe to have something to hold onto in a
world gone crazy. The gang gives him a group of friends his own
age, to whom he is loyal and who are loyal to him. He gets to feel
a part of something bigger and more powerful than his own
insignificant self. He gets status within the gang that he could
never have outside it, which attracts girls and makes him look
tough to other guys. To reflect these factors, all gangs have the
trappings of an intiate group; they must maintain rituals, know
codes and undergo intiations.
Using the following guidelines, the gamemaster should
develop the concept for a gang before the players create their
gang characters.
Gang Focus
The gang focus is the reason why this group of individuals
got together. Because gang members are all like-minded individuals, the gang focus is usually narrow and frequently based on
hatred of something or someone. The most common gangs are
those in which the members are all one race: trolls, elves, humans
and so on. The flip side is almost as common-multi-racial gangs
whose focus is mutual hatred of one race in particular. If a gang's
focus is to unite all the neighborhood trolls, then obviously all of
the gang members will be trolls. If a gang's focus is hatred of
trolls, people of any race aside from trolls can join. A gang's focus
might also be to fight a megacorp whose activities or products
have been killing "our kind": these types of gangs are especially
common in Oakland, California Free State. Gangs like this will
accept recruits of any race who pledge to help bring down "the
enemy." Still other gangs are generally anti-corp, anti-government, and so on.
Initation Rituals
These rituals can be anything that a ganger must undergo to
become a member. The ritual can include personal pain, a particular mission, hazing, tattooing or scarring and so on, and usually
also involves an oath or vow. The initiation ritual to become a lieutenant may be different than the ritual to become a member; the
ritual might change with a gang's leader, or a new leader might
require the gang members to renew their vow or oath to show
loyalty to him or her. Upon successfully completing the ritual, a
new recruit is considered a full-fledged member of the gang.
Uniforms
Known commonly as colors, gang uniforms can be anything
from red bandannas and red socks to the complete uniform of the
New York Yankees baseball team circa 1918. Everything from a
particular piece of clothing worn to a type of weapon used may
be part or all of the uniform. Uniforms let people know exactly
what gang a gang member belongs to, and gangers consider it
dishonorable to remove their colors for any reason.
Symbol
A gang's symbol is used to mark their territory: gangers may
also wear the symbol as a tattoo or a logo on their jackets.
Territory
Territory is the gang's home turf, its boundaries usually
marked by their symbol. Any given gang's turf is usually in one
area of a city and is patrolled by the gang members. Patrols are
especially likely if a gang shares a border with an enemy gang.
Territory is a gang's ego reflected: members of other gangs are
rarely allowed to cross a rival's territory, though a gang's turf may
include limited "free" or "safe" zones such as the local street doc's
clinic or a school. A good rule of thumb for determining the size
of a gang's territory is to make it a number of city blocks equal to
the number of gang members (including NPCs). Keeping within
that limit should make it possible for the gang to patrol its turf.
Operations
Operations are the gang's main cash cow (or cows). The
gangers may be front men for the yakuza, roughing up businesses that don't pay their protection money on time. Or they may run
their own protection racket. They may sell BTLs, smuggle contraband, strip cars, or anything else likely to earn them money to live
on and to finance their particular war.

Uniqueness
Each gang has a unique style; maybe they only fight with
katanas, or maybe they're all orks. Go-gangs are a unique type of
street gang because they only ride cycles; one of the more unique
go-gangs is the one that only deals in highway robbery between
Seattle and Portland. They rarely kill anyone and always take the
customs papers for the border. Other gangs are known for the
type of shadow businesses they take on, as well as how they perform that business. Names, pets, main squeezes, hobbies and
fighting tactics may all define a gang's uniqueness. The only limits are the players' imaginations and the gamemaster's approval.
CHARACTER CREATION
No gang character may start with more than 90,000 nuyen. If
you are using the priority system of character creation, that means
the character cannot make resources Priority A or B. Depending
on the gang's make-up, a character's race may or may not matter.
All gangs have Enemies, most of them other gangs. To find
out how many gangs are Enemies for the player characters, the
gamemaster should divide the number of gang member player
characters by 2 (round fractions up). (The bigger you are, the more
people want to take you down, right?) For gamemastering purposes, treat all rival gangs as Rank 2 Enemies. Each player character will also have an individual Rank | Enemy: a member of a
rival gang. a squatter, a BTL dealer, a prostitute or other street person whom the ganger has slotted off, a corporate wage slave that
he has inadvertently (or intentionally) hurt, even a member of his
own gang who dislikes him because of some past slight. These
Enemies will often prefer to humiliate the character rather than kill
him outright.
If a player purchases Gang Background for 50 percent of his
character's starting nuyen, then that character is the gang leader
at the beginning of the campaign. If more than one player wants
his character to be leader, the one who spends the highest percentage of his or her starting income on Gang Background wins
the honor. If a player cannot roleplay a charismatic leader, don't
expect the other player characters to be willing to listen to him.
NPCs may stay loyal for a little longer, but they won't stick by a
complete frag-off either. Gangs are nothing if not disorganized,
and a leader who can't keep his followers' loyalty won't last very
long (see Leadership Battle, p. 124). The rest of the player characters are lieutenants, to differentiate them from NPCs and regular gangers. Because of his or her position of power, the leader
gets a a second Rank 1 Enemy. (It's tough at the top.)
The gang as a whole gets a single Fixer Contact at Level 1.
This contact is established when the gang is created, and does not
count as an individual contact. The fixer fences the gang's booty
(if any; see Special Rules, p. 123).
Gang members usually aren't a well-educated bunch. Many
have not completed high school and extremely few have gone to
college. To reflect this, no ganger can have starting Knowledge,
Technical or Magical Skill ratings above 3, including Sorcery,
Conjuring. Magical Theory. Demolitions and Computer skills. In addition, the Edges of High School Education, College Education and
Technical School are all double the standard cost. The point of a
ganger campaign is to have fun without being the best at anything.
Gangers tend to have less money than other types of characters and they don't know very many people with money. This
means they can't always get their hands on what they want, even
when they have the nuyen. To reflect this, gangers cannot have
any starting gear with an Availability higher than 5.
When creating a gang, the gamemaster rolls 2D6 per the
rules for Gangs/Tribesmen (p. 44, SRII). Gang members created
this way are NPCs that the gamemaster may allow the players to
control. These gangers belong to the entire group, not to any individual gang member or leader, and do not count as contacts for
character creation. All gangers are assumed to know others in
their gang; aside from that, ganger characters get the normal
number of Contacts or Buddies per standard rules. Gangers are
not likely to have non-Street contacts; if they do, there should be
an interesting story behind the friendship. For more information
on generating a gang, see Gang Creation, p. 121.
Because most gangs lack resources and funds, they rarely
boast mages among their number. Cyberware is also a relative rarity, though the less expensive stuff trickles down to the back
streets. Deckers are the rarest characters in a gang because of the
cost of equipment and most gangers' lack of training and cyberware. Many a gang member sports a datajack, but actual Matrix
access is uncommon. Riggers, by contrast, are common. Taking
vehicles and borrowing parts to jury-rig faster or more powerful
vehicles are all a part of life for many gangs.
Gang Options
The character creation rules above apply to the "typical"
street gang: by using a few variations, the gamemaster can create
several other gang types.
The basic concept behind an all-elf gang might be a bunch
of bored rich kids convinced of their own superiority, Unlike other
gangs, they aren't fighting for their lives; instead, they're out to
destroy their "inferiors." They would have more money and prestige than a regular street gang; characters can have up to
400,000 nuyen (Priority B to Resources) as starting money.
Mages are more common in all-elf gangs than in regular gangs.
and the members are generally better educated. On the other
hand, elf gangs have twice as many Enemies as a regular gang.
and must maintain at least a Medium Lifestyle.
The tribesmen gang is not the usual urban gang; this type of
gang operates between cities or on very localized turf. Tribesmen
are almost always human Native Americans: metahuman members must also be from NAN lands or have Native American
blood. The tribesmen follow the standard rules for street gangs.
except that one character-usually the leader-must be a shaman.
Whether or not the shaman is the leader, his or her totem will be
part of the gang's symbol. Deckers and riggers are scarce in tribesmen groups. Only the leader will have City or Street contacts; all
other contacts should be Rural or Tribal.
The decker gang is a specialized type of gang whose leader
must start the game with 1,000,000 nuyen (Priority A to
Resources). The 50-percent Gang Background fee buys the leader

not only his position, but also pays for random jackpoints that he
has set up in at least 10 locations (determined by the gamemaster and the player running the leader character) and two hidden
micronics shops. The Gang Background/Leadership fee in this
case serves as a recruitment tool. Decker gangers have no cash or
education limits, though only the leader should have any Street
contacts. The rest of the gangers have contacts via the Matrix. The
gamemaster determines if a given Matrix contact is the real deal
or a Matrix poser.
ADVENTURE IDEAS
Gang campaigns operate on a different scale than shadowruns; they usually boil down to helping your own gang, hurting a rival gang, or internal power plays. Because gangs function
In many ways like miniature crime families, most gang campaigns
should use the Karma and the Amoral Campaign rules (p. 78).
Gangs run small smuggling and theft rings, protection rackets,
BTL deals, even prostitution rackets. The point of playing a gang
is to fight the gang's Enemies, and in order to do that the gang
needs nuyen to equip themselves for their ongoing war. The economics of the gang's operations is determined by the gamemaster, but keep in mind that the average small-time street gang usually acts as middlemen (see Special Rules, below).
Gang wars are the bread and butter of a gang's existence.
Gang wars can run the gamut from bragging and posturing to fist
and knife fights to blazing firefights and all-out destruction. Many
gang wars are one-on-one battles; for the character being "called
out" in this way, even a knife fight can be as intense and suspenseful as a war. Gang rivalries are also dynamic; an exciting
mini-campaign might involve the characters needing to make
peace with a rival gang, and having to convince both sides to sit
down and do it.
Ganger campaigns can often be humorous; gangers can be
putzes. Without money or training, they aren't going to be good
at much, and the kindest thing the gamemaster can do is to keep
the opposition at a manageable level. The point of the game is
fun, so if the players come up with an in-character creative solution, give it to them even if it's not quite plausible. Gang campaigns can make a nice break from other campaigns or other
games. The weight of the world is not on the characters' shoulders
in this type of campaign; they shouldn't feel much pressure to do
things right, and no matter how dumb, clumsy or inept they are,
they know that others are worse.
If you want to showcase the dark side of the streets of the
future and the bleak life of the poor. a gang campaign is perfect
for that, too. Gang characters have nothing; they have to watch
their friends and family suffer without much power to help them.
Most NPCs treat them like dirt, and when they try to earn some
money shadowrunning, people take it as confirmation that they
are nothing but worthless killers.
CAMPAIGNING WITH GANGS
The following section complements the Archetypal
Adventure Plots section, p. 101 of Running the Game, by fleshing out some of the concepts presented in that section.
The Premise
The characters are all part of an urban gang or tribe trying to
survive and prosper in the Barrens or similar abandoned areas of
the metroplex. They must deal with all the challenges of the mean
streets, but have few resources to call upon. Any major metroplex
can serve as the setting for a gang campaign, with different settings offering different atmospheres and story opportunities.
Choose a setting with which the gamemaster and the players are
comfortable; most of the campaign's stories will take place there
and so the gamemaster needs to generate a large amount of
detailed information about the setting.The characters' turf should
be especially well-defined. Many of the campaign's stories will
have a personal tone because they deal with small-scale events,
The Goal
The gang is family and tribe, and so loyalty to one's fellow
gang members is the most important quality. Never show weakness in front of another gang. Answer all challenges to your
gang's turf and honor. Never cooperate with "the man" or anyone
else in authority from outside your gang. Oh, and survive until
tomorrow. Simple, eh?
Opposition
Major antagonists for a gang campaign are other gangs who
want to cut into the characters' turf and squeeze them out.
Conflicts between various gangs in the campaign can also be influenced by corporate interests working behind the scenes for their
own purposes.
The hardware and resources available to shadowrunners
rarely fall into the hands of a bunch of scroffy gangers. Therefore,
conflict between gangs and the fight for day-to-day survival in the
urban jungle offer plenty of opportunities for violent conflict, as
much to get money and gear as for any other reason. Gang violence often erupts in large-scale combats between two gangs, but
can also show up in small-scale brawls and challenges between
individual gangers. Finding ways to solve problems without violence can be posed as an interesting challenge to characters in this
type of campaign.
Complications
The restrictions on power may prove frustrating to some
players; also, constantly tending to the needs of the gang may
take over the campaign and leave no room for other types of stories.
SPECIAL RULES
The rules below answer some major questions and offer
strategies for dealing with some of the problems that may arise
when running a gang campign.
Earning Money
Shadowrun is usually a do-the-job-get-paid world. In a gang
campaign, however, characters aren't working for Mr. Johnson, so
there usually isn't any pay for their efforts. Gangers do what they
do for pride, honor and the amount of pain they can inflict on

those they hate. That said, gang members must still earn cash to
live and improve their lot in life. Therefore, gangs usually run a
money-making operation of some sort-nothing big, but enough
to keep them flush.
Most gangs get their cash by acting as middlemen in smalltime criminal deals-say. BTL dealing or selling illegal weapons.
A simple way to figure rates of pay for this work is to assume that
the gang pays 10 to 60 percent of an illegal item's price and then
sells it for the prices listed in various Shadowrun products. For
example, a gang selling BTL chips at approximately 50 nuyen
apiece might purchase them for 25 nuyen from their fixer; this
nets the gang a 25-nuyen profit per chip. As always, the
gamemaster can simulate the randomness of real-world economics by basing the percentage that the gangers pay on a D6 roll.
The gamemaster can also add or deduct an extra 5 or 10 percent.
depending on whether or not the gang won its last turf war or
completed its most recent mission.
Gangs can also make money by stealing vehicles. Assuming
they don't steal the vehicle to use (which saves them money
because they don't have to buy one), they can sell it or strip it. If
they keep it, they can do anything they want with it-repaint it,
smash it into buildings, live out of it, whatever. If they decide to
sell it, they can net up to 50 percent of the listed price. If the characters decide to strip the vehicle and sell the individual parts, they
will get the full price for the vehicle as listed, but cannot collect
until a number of days equal to the total of the vehicle's Body and
Armor ratings has passed.
The Sploches steal a Mitsubishi Nightsky out of
parking lot near Dante's Inferno. They weigh their
options. The can keep the kick-butt car and use it
against the Zero Hours, with whom the Sploches are
at war. But the Sploches need nuyen. If they sell the
car whole, they can (maybe) get 125.000 nuyenenough to keep the gang in arms, BTLs and synthehol for a long time. If they strip it, they can get the
entire 250.000-nuyen purchase price, but the cred
would take 8 days to arrive (Body 5 + Armor 3 - 8).
The Sploches can't be sure the Zero Hours won't
attack in those 8 days, so they decide to sell the car
(after a couple of hits on a cash register or two on the
way back to their home turf).
Reputation and Leadership
Essentially, a gang's leader is the gang. The leader is the glue
that keeps the gang together, and the leader's rep is the gang's
rep. The leader of a gang relies on a combination of fear, reputation and honor to retain his authority, rather than the standard
Leadership skill. To determine a gang leader's (and therefore the
gang's) Reputation Rating, use the standard Reputation rules (p.
199. SRII), but use the character's total Karma Points. In addition
to representing the target number for people outside his gang to
know of him or her, the Reputation Rating reflects how loyal the
other gang members will be in a leadership battle (see below),
Leadership Battle
Gangs get involved in infighting more often than gang wars.
Invariably, a gang member will challenge the leader for control of
the gang in a one-on-one battle. Rules for a leadership battle are
determined by the gamemaster and the player or players controlling the character or characters making the challenge. The fight
can be unarmed combat, a "one knife, two fighters" combat, an
old-fashioned duel or any other known or imaginary version of
single combat. The battle and the results can be humorous or a
bloodbath. The fight can be to the death or to humiliation (which
many gangers consider far worse). The winner becomes (or
remains) the gang leader.
In a leadership battle between the leaders of two gangs or
the leader of a gang and an outsider trying to take control of an
established gang, one "contestant" may have a higher Leadership
Rating than the other. For each 2 additional points of Leadership
Rating of the higher-rated opponent, that opponent subtracts |
from all tests made during the leadership battle. The winning
gang gets the losing gang's assets and turf. At that point, each
member of the losing gang makes an Intelligence Test against the
result of the new leader's Reputation Rating minus his or her (the
new leader's) Charisma. (Subtracting the leader's Charisma represents his or her efforts to sway the gang members into following
his or her leadership.) Those whose tests fail will walk away, either
forming their own gang to exact revenge against the leader or
becoming that character's personal Enemies.
Red, the leader of the Ladies from Hades.
decides to take on Goldy, the leader of the Medusas.
Red wins. Red's Reputation is 15 and her Charisma is
6, and so the nine surviving Medusas each make an
Intelligence Test against a Target Number 9 (15 - 6 =
9). Five of the Medusas make successful tests. The
remaining four take off, to form a new gang or seek
revenge.
Gang Creation on the Fly
When a group forms a gang, the opposition is usually another gang. To create an entire gang out of whole cloth, the
gamemaster should use the Creating Prime Runners rules (p. 84).
The gamemaster should also make sure that the rival gang's numbers match those of the player-character gang, or at least come
close. No matter how tough its members, a smaller gang will
always lose to a larger one in the long run, and so the gamemaster should aim for a roughly equal balance of forces. Gangs have
one of four possible ratings: Inferior, Equal, Superior or
Superhuman. There are no Ultimate gangs. All gangs follow the
standard rules for ganger NPC statistics.
If an Inferior gang has double the numbers of the player characters' gang, they are considered Equal for the purposes of Threat
Ratings and Dice Pools. An Inferior gang should have fewer lieutenants than the player characters' gang.
If an Equal gang is twice as large as the player characters
gang, consider them Superior for purposes of Threat Ratings and
Dice Pools. If an Equal gang has less than half the numbers of the
player characters' gang, treat them as Inferior for determining

Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. An Equal gang should have the
same number of lieutenants as the player characters' gang.
If a Superior gang has double the numbers of the player characters' gang, they are considered Superhuman for purposes of
Threat Ratings and Dice Pools. If such a gang has less than half the
player-character gang's numbers, consider them Equal for determining Threat Ratings and Dice Pools, A Superior gang should
have more lieutenants than the player characters' gang: the exact
number is up to the gamemaster.
A Superhuman gang follows the standard rules for NPC
statistics, but usually wins its battles no matter how much
smaller they are than the player characters' gang. The
Superhuman gang has at least twice as many lieutenants as
the player characters' gang.
A Superhuman or Superior gang may have divisions in
any of the less powerful classifications. For example, the
gamemaster may decide that the Inferior gang you just
destroyed is actually a division of a Superhuman gang that
was looking to move into the player characters' turf. The
player characters just made a powerful gang leader very,
very unhappy
As with player-character gangs, the size of the
turf should determine the size of the gang. The
minimum number of gangers is one per city block;
there is no maximum.
GANGS IN SHADOWRUN
The following five examples represent
Seattle-based street gangs of various power
levels. The information provided appears in
the format used in Gang Creation (p. 121).
with the following additions,
Leader: Refers to the gang leader and
lieutenants (if any), with a brief bio for each.
Gang Rating: Inferior, Equal, Superior or
Superhuman.
Head Count: Represents the number of members in the gang.
Foes: Other gangs and/or organizations that the
gang considers their primary enemies.
These gangs can be used as gang archetypes or as
is. Most were first mentioned in the Seattle
Sourcebook. More gangs will be highlighted in various upcoming Shadowrun products, presented in
this format. These descriptions supersede all other
Information published about these gangs.
THE HALLOWEENERS
Gang Focus: This gang started as a small group
of humans out to rob the rich folk of downtown
Seattle of their cred and trinkets, Renraku Security
eventually decided that enough was enough; they
sent operatives to follow the Halloweeners and
their then-leader, Funky Errak, to the gang's hideout. The ensuing gun battle left the hideout in flames
and most of the original Halloweeners dead. Only the
%

current leader (known as Slash and Burn) and two other founding
members survived. Slash has decided that all megacorps will pay
for Renraku's crime, and has opened the ranks of the
Halloweeners to anyone willing to take on the corps. This gang
has a reputation as one of the most psychotic in the sprawl.
Leader: Slash and Burn, human. An incredibly skinny freak, he
likes to burn those who oppose his gang.
Lieutenants: 5
Zazz. a human mage and an original Halloweener who survived along with Slash. Zazz still suffers nightmares about fire and
has a mental block against using any kind of fire spell.
Zany Janey, a human razorgirl and another original member.
She just loves to cut people-the more blood the better. Janey is
Slash's girl.
Honest Jack, a dwarf, He rescued Zazz, Slash and Janey from
the fire, which also destroyed his home. He became the first new
member of the Halloweeners, and he wants every corper dead.
He loves to shoot guns.
Sister Love, a female elf and a rigger. Sister is Zazz's main
squeeze.
Bobby Blue, a troll. He likes to hit people-any people.
Gang Rating: Superior
Head Count: Approximately 25-40 members.
Initation Rituals: The Halloweeners use two rituals. The first is the
Circle of Fire, in which the gangers build a fire around the recruit.
The recruit remains in the middle of the fiery circle for about as
long as Slash remembers being in the burning building during the
Renraku attack (approximately 5 to 10 minutes). The second ritual is to break into a megacorporate office and bring something
back as proof.
Uniforms: The colors of the Halloweeners are orange and black,
befitting their name. Most often they wear black clothing, with
orange bandannas tied to their arms, legs or neck. They dress up
to commit their crimes and almost always wear masks. Ever since
the fire, Slash prefers to wear a big ape head when having his fun.
Zazz favors a hellhound mask that looks freakishly real in the lights
of the downtown arcologies.
Symbol: Originally a pumpkin with an evil leer, the gang's symbol
has evolved to the now-familiar vague representation of a pumpkin (usually a circle with eyes and mouth) smiling demonically
against a fiery background. The eyes and mouth seem to be coming out of the fire.
Territory: The Halloweeners consider all of downtown and every
arcology their turf (that's where they fight their never-ending war.
after all). Their headquarters is just outside the downtown area, in
the docks south of the Renraku Arcology. They control and patrol
the docks up to and including the ones behind the Renraku
Arcology, plus the entire area west to the river (including half of
Kobe Terrace Park) up to the border of downtown.
Operations: The Halloweeners make their nuyen in straight crime
sprees. Most of what they sell goes to the Triads or the Seoulpa
Rings.
Foes: The Halloweeners rarely fight other gangs. They prefer to
concentrate on their main enemies: Renraku security forces, Lone
Star and (surprisingly enough) the yakuza and the Mafia. The
Halloweeners will steal from anyone they think looks corporate
enough, and the yaks and the Mob fit that bill. The Halloweeners
sometimes run into trouble with other gangs because they tend to
ignore turf borders. Several gangs in the downtown area and
south of downtown Seattle have fought with the Halloweeners at
various times.
Uniqueness: Aside from Slash's weird fire fetish, the
Halloweeners have no specific modus operandi. They attack those
they perceive to be corporate wage slaves, make the occasional
hit on the Renraku docks, and every once in a while pull a run on
Renraku or some other downtown corp. Their crimes tend to be
brutal: multiple deaths, plenty of property damage, fires and so
on. The Halloweeeners like to set fires. From fear of their bloodthirsty reputation, no one hits them very hard or for very long.
Certainly no one wants to be on Slash's hit list.
THE SPIDERS
Gang Focus: More than anything else, this multi-racial gang
is characterized by its members' implacable hatred of bug spirits.
This loathing is personal and visceral. Every one of the original
Spiders fell into the hands of the Universal Brotherhood at some
point in his or her life, and none of them have gotten over the horrors they experienced. Living to destroy bugs, in the company of
a like-minded "family," is their way of dealing with these traumas.
Their links with the Spider totem, which each gang member meets
as part of his or her initiation ritual, reinforces this fiercely anti-bug
mindset
The gang is extremely violent, but keeps a relatively low profile nonetheless. Unlike other violent gangs, they never leave
"calling cards" or other clues to their presence. Like the spiders
they emulate, these gangers prefer to strike silently as well as
lethally. They recruit new members by snatching likely prospects
off the Seattle streets and brainwashing them into joining the
gang over the course of several days. Their methods are brutal
and effective: most prospective recruits become true believers in
short order.
Leader: Widow, a human Spider shaman. She wears black all the
time, to set off her pale skin and gray eyes. She could be anywhere from 20 to 35 years old-no one can tell for sure. She is
incredibly vain about her hands, which are long and narrow and
extremely graceful.
Lieutenants: 5
Tarantula, a young ork recently promoted after singlehandedly killing two roach spirits with a jerry-built contraption that she
refers to as "my Raid can." Barely out of her teens, Tarantula is
Widow's protege; the gang leader treats her almost like a daughter. Tarantula repays this regard with fanatical loyalty, Imitating
everything Widow says or does.
Fiddler, an elf and founding member of the gang, Skinny and
undernourished, with piercing black eyes, Fiddler is a city-dweller
down to his toenails; he claims he can't breathe if he goes too far
away from the concrete jungle. His arms are covered with puckered scars, about which he refuses to speak.
Trapdoor, a dwarf. He hates wasp spirits above all other bugs.
though he'll glady kill any bugs he can get his hands on. Trapdoor
plays incessantly with a cat's cradle, and can make more shapes
with it than anyone alive ever knew existed.

Wolf, a human who escaped from the Chicago
Containment Zone just a year ago. He is convinced that his
Spider totem led him to Seattle, the one place on Earth
where he could hope to find people capable of "casting
out" the fly spirit that he believes was attempting to
possess him. The Spiders picked him up in the
Redmond Barrens within weeks of his arrival in Seattle,
sized him up as a potentially powerful magician, and
made him their own in record time. Wolf believes
that Widow is divinely appointed to rid the world of
bugs, and that she will ascend into Heaven on spider-silk wings when her task is finished.
Recluse, a troll and Fiddler's squeeze. She
rarely talks to anyone except Fiddler, and even to
him rarely uses more than two or three words at
a time. She's deadly with almost any kind of
blade, but is especially partial to a jagged-edged
hunting knife that she's named "Sweeney."
Somewhere. Recluse picked up detailed knowledge of anatomy (though she doesn't remember
where anymore), and so she supervises the bulk of
the gang's organlegging activity.
Gang Rating: Superior
Head Count: Approximately 50-100 members.
Initiation Rituals: Each prospective recruit goes on a
vision quest to meet Spider and receive his or her
gang name (always the name of a spider). Those who
survive this ordeal become gang members; those
who don't generally die raving with a day or two of
the quest's end. Once a new ganger receives a
name. he or she is assigned a specific task as part
of "guarding the Web." In practice, this usually
means a specific building to protect, area to patrol,
or other job to do that somehow relates to keeping
the gang's territory bug-free. More experienced
gangers explain carefully to each newbie exactly what
their assigned task is, how best to do it, and why it's
important in the Scheme of Things.
After proving themselves by fulfilling their
assigned tasks well, new gangers move on to Part 2 of
their initiation-kidnapping a potential initiate. They usually also take part in the brainwashing of their victim, sometimes even assuming the leading role. Once they accomplish
this, they are eligible to become lieutenants.
To become a lieutenant, a ganger must kill a bug spirit singlehandedly. The ganger in question seeks out a nest of bugs
and informs at least five fellow gangers of his or her intent to
kill one. These witnesses accompany the gang member to
ground zero, where they watch the ganger attempt to kill
the bug. They do not Intervene unless their fellow ganger
looks likely to lose the fight, in which case they will jump into
combat to save the ganger's life. The ganger does not become a
lieutenant. however, and must spend at least a year living down
the disgrace before being permitted to try again.
Uniforms: The Spiders wear synthleather jackets in the gang's
colors: black or dark brown and red. Most often, black or dark
0
0

brown is the background color, with a red design on the jacket in
synthleather, embroidery, paint or (occasionally) colored tape.
Symbol: Each Spider makes (or finds) his or her own variation on
a web-anything from the classic spiderweb to a butterfly net to
a schematic representation of a Matrix network. These symbols
may be painted or embroidered on jackets, worn as shoulder
patches or jewelry, tattooed on the ganger's body, or anything
else the ganger desires. All gang members wear web tattoos on
their shaved scalps.
Territory: The Spiders claim all of Redmond as their territory.
which they refer to as "the Web." According to rumor, their headquarters is an abandoned warehouse in a particularly godforsaken
section of Redmond known as Brain Heaven.
Operations: To finance their bughunting expeditions and pay for
their living expenses, the Spiders
most often serve as couriers,
fences and other types of criminal
middlemen. They also frequently
resort to petty theft. The
most lucrative of their
activities is
organ-legging,
as they have a
steady supply of
failed recruits
to carve up
for spare
parts
Foes: The
gang considers bug spirits
of all types
as its primary foes,
and will
go out of
its way to
assault
bugs or
anyone
ELVES
MUST
DIE
the gang perceives as being somehow "in league" with the bugs.
(This definition can be fairly loose, depending on who's making
the call.) The Spiders also have occasional run-ins with other
gangs in Redmond, generally when another gang "refuses to
accept the Spiders' protection from the evil bug spirits."
Uniqueness: The Spiders pride themselves on acting like their
namesakes-moving silently and striking so swiftly that the
"enemy" is immobilized or dead before he knows what hit him.
They mark their territory with signs rather than patrols; an intruder into Spider turf will suddenly find himself surrounded by
gangers who seemingly materialized from thin air, and will shortly afterward be unconscious or a corpse. This "guerrilla warfare"
approach has made the Spiders a force to be reckoned with,
against bug spirits and in more ordinary criminal
activities. Spider couriers have a reputation for being
able to deliver the goods in record time;
Spider fences are known for webs of
contacts so dazzlingly vast that most
attempts to trace the sale of illegal
goods back to the gang end in failure.
THE SPIKES
Gang Focus: Once a run-of-the-mill
go-gang. the Spikes (formerly the
Spike Wheels) have recently
come under the leadership of a
charismatic troll named Lord Torgo.
Torgo became the gang boss after singlehandedly destroying one of its
major rivals, the Silent Ps; after
the victory, he changed the
gang's name to reflect its
improved status. Always antielf, the gang has stepped up its
operations against Tir Tairngire
under Torgo's control.
Leader: Lord Torgo, a troll of
awe-inspiring dimensions with
a bloodthirsty streak to match
his size. Though as poorly
educated as any
other lifelong resident
of Seattle's
slums, he
is fantastically
intelligent, and
reads everything
he can get his mitts
on. His favorite
books-actual paper
books with battered covers and dog-eared pages-are
Sun Tzu's The Art of War and
Machaivelli's The Prince. Though
no one dares mock him for his
interest in reading

(though many consider it a waste of time and energy better
devoted to survival), the information contained in his best-loved
books allowed him to dispatch the Silent Ps in the spectacularly
messy and unquestionably personal manner that solidified his
fearsome reputation throughout Seattle.
Lieutenants: 2
Goddess Ursula, an enormous female troll and Torgo's main
squeeze. She can barely write her own name, but has an instinct
for fighting tactics that won her Torgo's respect. She loves to ride
at full speed toward large armored trucks, firing away with an Uzi
in one hand and a rocket launcher in the other.
Manny One-eye, only half Torgo's size but fanatically loyal to
him. Manny has not a brain in his head, and is so hideous that his
appearance alone will intimidate almost any enemy. He claims to
have lost his eye in a brawl with a Tir Ghost patrol, of which he
was the only survivor. Current rumor among the Spikes says he
actually lost it in a poker game with the gang's previous leader,
and that Torgo won it back for him. Torgo is said to keep the eye
in a lock-box under a floorboard in the gang's HQ.
Gang Rating: Superior
Head Count: Approximately 15-25 members.
Initiation Rituals: To join the Spikes, a prospective recruit must
kill an elf. He can accomplish this any way he wishes, but must
have at least two witnesses to the killing and must bring back a
"trophy" for Lord Torgo to put on display. Favorite trophies are
ears and scalps-the latter especially if the victim had hair of an
unusual color.
Uniforms: All gang members wear camo fatigues, in keeping with
Lord Torgo's conceit that the gang is actually a disciplined private
army. Gang members also wear gold bandannas, most often tied
around their heads or upper arms.
Symbol: Usually spray-painted on the sides of vehicles they've
trashed, the Spikes' symbol is a crudely drawn elf head with Xes
for eyes; the head is pierced by a spike, which frequently (though
not always) has blood dripping from it.
Territory: The Spikes claim Interstate 5 and the neighborhoods
surrounding it, from just south of downtown Seattle all the way to
the Tir Tairngire border-this area includes Fort Lewis, Puyallup
and Hell's Kitchen. Their HQ is rumored to be in Fort Lewis,
though no one knows exactly where.
Operations: As the "tollkeepers" of Interstate 5, the Spikes are
perfectly placed to indulge in their favorite activity-attacking
anything and anyone going into or coming out of Tir Tairngire.
Any vehicle on the road is fair game, but favorite targets include
shipments of goods with potentially high value in Seattle's shadows. In addition to (literal) highway robbery, the Spikes are known
for particularly vicious hate crimes against elves.
Foes: Lord Torgo's personal ambition is to destroy the Ancients.
Seattle's best-known elf gang. He and his fellow gangers love to
use Tir border patrols as target practice. As the gang's primary
enemies are elves, they rarely bother ork or human or dwarf
gangs unless provoked.
Uniqueness: One of the few all-troll gangs in the Seattle sprawl.
the Spikes are known for their unorthodox mode of attacking
their chosen targets. Like the ancient Mongol hordes who galloped across the steppes of Central Asia, the Spikes ride down
their victims en masse; the sight of a posse of troll bikers thundering toward a truck or armored car, howling all the way, has
given more than one driver heart failure.
THE RED HOT NUKES
Gang Focus: The Red Hot Nukes prefer to think of themselves
as a neighborhood association rather than a gang, despite their
clearly illegal activities. They regard their primary mission as protecting and aiding residents of their neighborhood any way they
can. Though membership is only open to dwarfs, the Nukes display no prejudice against other races; they will defend their people against any threat, and define "their people" as being everyone who lives on their turf.
Leader: Grinder, a young black dwarf and ex-runner with an anarchist bent. Grinder is a physical adept, and is personally training
every member of the Nukes to be as talented a physad as he is.
On the rare occasions when Grinder gets tipsy, he hints at his
deep dark reason for founding and training the gang-he claims
to have discovered some horrible future event while on an antimegacorp run a few years ago, which he is grooming the Nukes
to prevent. He refuses to tell anyone exactly what this future is;
the mere mention of it gives him nightmares.
Lieutenants: None.
Gang Rating: Equal
Head Count: Approximately 15-25 members.
Initiation Rituals: Each new recruit must prove himself by disarming a bomb built by Grinder. Those who fail this test are blown
to smithereens.
Uniforms: The Red Hot Nukes wear gray and red, and each of
them sports a baseball-style cap.
Symbol: The gang's insignia is a mushroom cloud, which commemorates both their name and their skill with explosives. The
symbol appears somewhere on every ganger's clothing, often
painted on their jackets or worn as a patch on the jacket or cap.
Territory: The Nukes claim Redmond as their turf; their headquarters is in the Hollywood neighborhood.
Operations: The Nukes specialize in jobs that require expertise
with explosives. In addition to demolitions, they build small
bombs for use in protection rackets and insurance scams; local
businessmen who need ready cash frequently call on the Nukes to
destroy their businesses so that they can then pocket the insurance money. Part of every ganger's training involves bomb-building with a wide variety of materials: the Nukes go out of their way
to avoid "signature" bomb-making styles so that law enforcement
can't trace explosive devices back to them. The gang also pulls the
occasional theft, or even wetwork if the price is right.
Foes: Perhaps reflecting their leader's ex-runner background, the
Nukes are anti-corporate to the point of paranoia. Though they do
most of their demolition work for pay, they carry out a certain
number of sabotage runs against corporate research installations.
the more obscure the better. They regard most of the other gangs
in Redmond as "enemies of the people," and fight them when
they must; however, they don't go looking for trouble. The Spiders
and the Rusty Stilettos are the most frequent targets of punitive
action by the Nukes, as they are more likely than other gangs to
challenge the Nukes' authority.

Uniqueness: As far as anyone knows, the Red Hot Nukes are the
only gang composed entirely of dwarf physical adepts. They're
also the only ones who specialize in bomb-making to the virtual
exclusion of anything other moneymaking activities.
THE NIGHT HUNTERS
Gang Focus: The skinheads of the 2050s, this human-only
gang and its various like-named splinter groups live to hassle and
intimidate metahumans. Unlike their twentieth-century counterparts, the Night Hunters don't discriminate based on skin color or
gender: only metahumans are the targets of their hatred. They
lean toward the Humanis policlub party line, and proudly act as
front-line thugs in the policlub's war "to make the world safe for
true humanity." They are often violent, but actually kill their victims far less often than most people believe. Most gang members
are well under thirty: many of them are heavily into body-piercing
and chains.
Leader: Stiv (main group: the various splinter gangs have their
own leaders). Stiv grew up in a respectable middle-class home,
ruled by his father's iron hand. Father was a preacher of the fireand-brimstone variety, and as the oldest child Stiv got the lion's
share of harsh paternal attention. He is a classic sociopath-highly Intelligent and completely lacking in empathy or conscience.
When under extreme stress, he burns himself with cigarettes as a
way of proving himself impervious to pain.
Lieutenants: 2 (main group; splinter gangs vary)
Splitter, a stocky half-Amerind woman with vicious knife scars
on her cheek and throat. She claims to have gotten the scars on
the Night of Rage, when a rampaging band of trolls broke into her
home and murdered the rest of her family. The trolls left her for
dead, but she managed to drag herself to the household PANICBUTTON and call DocWagon. Orphaned and homeless, she survived as best she could on the streets of Seattle until the Night
Hunters took her in when she was ten years old. She has never
tried to challenge Stiv's authority: she considers it a waste of time
as long as there are metahumans around to hurt.
Shank, a skinny mulatto of nineteen who has been Stiv's
right-hand man for the past five years. Shank halls most recently
from Redding in Northern CalFree. and has an especial loathing of
elves (though other metas aren't much better, to his way of thinking). Abandoned by his mother at a young age, Shank doesn't
know who his father is; lately, though, he's been fantasizing that
Daddy is really Kenneth Brackhaven, Shank would never presume
on the relationship, however; he merely wants to admire his
"father" from afar. Right now, the Night Hunters are all the family
he needs.
Gang Rating: Equal
Head Count: Approximately 20-30 members.
Initiation Rituals: Each new recruit must brand a metahuman with
the Night Hunters' symbol. Some Hunter gangs will accept painting the symbol on a metahuman's skin, but most gangs prefer
more painful methods. The favorites are burning (like cattle branding) and carving the symbol about a quarter-inch into the skin with
a rusty knife. Particularly sadistic gangers follow up the second
method by sprinkling salt into the cuts.
Uniforms: Night Hunters favor head-to-toe black leather ornamented with chains and studs. All of them, male and female, wear
their hair in mohawks dyed bright green. Every Night Hunter
sports three hand razors on one hand, which they use to make
their distinctive slashing mark.
Symbol: A talon slashing the moon. They wear the symbol most
often on clothing or as a scalp tattoo. Many of the gang members
like to draw the symbol on their jackets in glow-in-the-dark paint:
that way. their intended victims can see them coming and feel the
appropriate terror.
Territory: The Hunters claim all of Renton, but lack enough members to patrol the area. Countless splinter gangs exist, all but one
of whom continue to call themselves the Night Hunters: the single exception is the group known as the Werewolves, which split
from the main band of Hunters three or four years ago and has
managed to share the gang's turf relatively peacefully.
Operations: The Night Hunters trade in BTLs for money: aside
from that, they commit whatever crime seems like it might be the
most fun way to kill a slow afternoon. They are partial to vandalism-there's nothing most Night Hunters like better than making
lots of noise and smashing things, especially if they can terrorize
some metahumans in the process. They rarely kill their metahuman victims: for most Hunters, the thrill is in humiliation and torture. A corpse doesn't cringe or beg for mercy, and so is no fun
any more.
Foes: The primary foe of all Night Hunter gangs is the entire
metahuman population of Seattle. From the high-level elf corporator to the ork janitor down the street. all metas are equally fair
game (though they prefer the very old and the very young as the
easiest to intimidate).
Other Night Hunter groups, formed when one lieutenant or
another tried and failed to unseat Stiv, are hostile to the main
gang (and to each other). Each splinter group sees itself as the
"true" Night Hunters to a greater or lesser degree: the various
groups act out this belief by assaulting each other or else refusing
to acknowledge each other's existence. On occasion, one Night
Hunter gang declares a holy war against another; these wars
invariably fizzle out after the first couple of casualties, however.
Uniqueness: More than any other human-only gang, the Night
Hunters are obssessed with humillating metahumans. If a
ganger's day goes by without his at least being able to spit on an
elf or trip up a troll, that day has been an utter waste of time.
Night Hunters love to collect trophies from their metahuman victims, especially elf ears, troll and ork tusks, and dwarf beards
(complete with the layer of skin that used to cover the unlucky
dwarf's chin), The gangs' distinctive triple arrangement of hand
razors is highly unusual.
