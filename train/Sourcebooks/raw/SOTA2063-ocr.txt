GENETECH
It's been a decade since Shadowland brought you any organized information on the
always-vibrant field of genetech, yet it's an industry that changes every day-not to
mention attracting more shadow biz than almost any other. Whether you're going in the
tank for your own genetic overhaul or working for or against a genetech research organi-
zation, it never hurts to be educated about what you're getting into. We figured we'd post
a few interesting documents we've found. As always, there are discussion forums to share
your own expertise.
Let's start the ball rolling with a quick scientific primer. First up is a transcript of a
Knowledge Network documentary on genetics in our time. It's pretty much straight science so
I've marked it read-only: you can save the chitchat for when it gets specific. As always, what
you do with this info is your own affair, but remember that knowledge is power. Enjoy.

MODERN GENETICS
Genetics (n); the study of heredity and variation of living organisms.
Genetics is no longer the domain of humorless laboratory technicians and mad scien-
tists-it plays a bigger part in our world than almost anyone realizes. Over the last century
its significance has grown exponentially, extending into every aspect of our lives. From the
food you eat to the medical checkups for your unborn baby, genetic technology is every-
where. Without the study of genes and the improvements they've brought us, our lives
would be very different.
But what is genetics? To understand the science of genes, we must first look at what
they are.
DNA AND THE GENE
All organisms are controlled by their DNA. DNA is a complex molecule with variable
structure that contains all of the organism's genetic information. Think of it as the control
computer that tells the automated factory how to build the product. Every living thing has
to have instructions like these or it cannot grow and develop. For now, though, let's just
look at metahuman genetics, since that's where a lot of pro-
gressive research has been focused.
Each one of your cells has a nucleus, the control center
of the cell. The nucleus contains chromosomes, long strings
of DNA organized into meaningful sequences called "genes."
Over 100,000 genes define every metahuman body, and
each one regulates a very specific part of your physical exis-
tence. There are genes that determine your eye color, how
tall you'll be, how good your eyesight is and every other
aspect of your body. But how do genes do that?
DNA's Structure and Form
DNA is made up of many "bases," building blocks con-
nected in a meaningful sequence. Each base connects to the
next to form a backbone, with part of each base protruding like
the teeth of a comb. These "teeth" can bind to the protrusions
of a mirror image DNA chain, forming a twisting ladder-like spi-
ral-the double helix so common in corporate biotech logos.
The teeth of the comb are what enable DNA to carry
information. There are four different bases-adenine, cyto-
sine, guanine and thymine. Each set of three bases, called a
codon, tells the body to produce a different amino acid. (Like
DNA's bases, amino acids are the building blocks of proteins.)
Twenty of the possible sixty-four codons define the amino
acids; the rest are control sequences.
Transcription and Translation
The information stored in DNA is made real by two pro-
cedures, transcription and translation. Transcription involves
copying the DNA's information to a messenger mRNA mole-
cule, and translation is the process of rendering the mRNA
into amino-acid chains-proteins.
Transcription begins when an enzyme selects the portion of
DNA to be copied, and prepares the complementary strand of
the helix for use as a template. An mRNA molecule is built on top
of the template, constructed one "block" at a time by pairing indi-
vidual RNA bases to the DNA bases in the template. The RNA
fragments are then joined to form a separate RNA molecule.
The mRNA strand contains the same genetic information
as the original DNA, and becomes the template for building
proteins. It is translated by tRNA, transfer molecules with a
specific codon recognition site on one end and an amino acid
attached to the other. As the tRNA molecules bind in
sequence to the mRNA codons, the amino acids on their
other ends also align and bind together to form polypeptide
chains. An unbound polypeptide with all the elements
required for functionality is a true protein.
This process is the "expression" of the gene; it's how the
gene's instructions are made physically manifest. These pro-
teins regulate everything about the body's function-physical
characteristics, mental functioning, internal chemical process-
es and so on. As soon as scientists discovered how DNA
worked in the early 1960s, it was obvious that a simple alter-
ation to a person's genome could effect radical changes in
their existence. Mastering such precise control over the gene,
however, proved easier said than done.
MANIPULATING OUR DNA
Modern genetic engineering is a delicate and exacting
science, especially compared with our early clumsy attempts
to tinker with simple organisms such as bacteria and virii.
Gene modulation can be as subtle or as broad as the imagi-
nation allows, though changes of great scope require very
careful attention from skilled gene engineers. Genetic engi-
neers can't build an entire metahuman from scratch yet-but
that may just be a matter of time.
Genetic engineering is achieved by removing sections of
DNA and replacing them with different sequences. This is
accomplished using several different techniques, or more
often a combination of any available strategies. Therapy
using restriction enzymes is the easiest to engineer, but its
utility is very limited; on the other end of the scale, nanite-
based modification is totally accurate and very flexible, but
very expensive and resource-intensive. Most genetic thera-
py work is carried out by recombination techniques, where
foreign DNA is merged into existing DNA using the body's
own genetic processes. Recombination has proved to be the
most efficient compromise between effectiveness and
resources required.
Restriction Enzymes
Restriction enzymes recognize specific sequences of DNA
and cut the DNA molecule to fit. Under normal circumstances,
the broken ends of the DNA chain will simply re-bond at the
point of the break. If another DNA fragment is floating nearby,
however, it may be incorporated when the breaks re-seal.
This procedure has significant limitations. It was discov-
ered almost ninety years ago, hailed as a potent tool for
genetic engineering and used to great effect for a long time.
Its inflexibility, however, severely restricts its usefulness today
when far better alternatives are available. Restriction enzymes
can only cleave DNA at precise points, and each enzyme only
recognizes one site. There are about a hundred recognition
sites, so only a limited number of genetic sequences can be
modified using restriction enzyme techniques. For more flexi-
ble modifications, genetic engineers had to look elsewhere.
They wound up looking to DNA recombination.
Recombinant DNA
"Recombinant DNA" seems to be the latest buzzword.
Anything made with recombinant DNA must automatically be
somehow better-or so the advertisements would have you
believe. However, recombination is simply a process of incor-
porating new lengths of DNA into a genetic structure. The
wonders that can be achieved with it depend on what kinds
of new DNA you introduce.
Technically, recombination is a catch-all term that refers
to any insertion of foreign DNA into an existing genome, but
it usually describes a specific process called strand exchange.
When a DNA helix splits the strands will usually re-bond;
canny gengineers can introduce new DNA that supplants one
of the strands in re-bonding, replacing old genes with new.
The inserted genes can vary from the DNA they replace,
while remaining bonded to its complementary strand as part
of the new genome.
The advantage of DNA recombination to a genetic engi-
neer is that it's a relatively simple process with nearly unlim-
ited flexibility. Any amount of DNA can be inserted by this
method without limiting modifications to restriction enzyme
recognition sites. DNA recombination isn't perfect for every
situation, though. It can't completely alter existing DNA; the
new material it inserts must bear at least a passing resem-
blance to what it's replacing. To completely change a partic-
ular genetic characteristic, gengineers have discovered that
there's only one real solution: nanite treatment.
Nanite Engineering
Nanites are the universal panacea for any problem that
involves microengineering. They're tiny machines used in
almost every commercial endeavor. Manufacturing and heavy
industry, primary production, medical and biomedical sci-
ences; all have benefited immeasurably from these tiny won-
ders of modern technology.
Most nanites used in the human body are approximate-
ly the size of red blood cells; they work on a multi-cellular
level, so they don't need to be any smaller. That isn't the
lower limit of their size, though; nanites are capable of exist-
ing and operating on a molecular scale. It's these truly
nanoscopic machines that are required for complete control
over our genes, and medical research has been on the cutting
edge of the nano-industry for a long time.
Gengineering nanites manipulate DNA by any number of
mechanisms. Their programming is far more complex than any
cellular process, and they're capable of examining and select-
ing a particular fragment of DNA far more precisely than
enzymes for restriction engineering or strand-exchange
recombination. Various nanite breeds work together to build
new sequences of DNA to the maker's specifications, insert it
into our genomes, trim away any excess and dispose of it
neatly. They aren't restricted by recognition sites and don't
have to maintain similarity with the original DNA-when
nanite engineering reaches its full potential, we'll be able to
create wonders that our forebears could never have imagined.
Despite the rosy outlook, nanite genetech has its flaws just
like every other gene-manipulation technology. Here the limit-
ing factor is generally cost-"ordinary" nanites are expensive
enough, and gengineer nanites are built to much more precise
specifications. Any genetic manipulation resulting in wholesale
changes of DNA rather than subtle modification requires the
use of nanites, and the associated cost places such treatments
out of the reach of most ordinary citizens. Subsidy programs do
exist, though, for remedial-therapy genetech-particularly in
the case of congenital impairments-and the steady march of
progress allows prices to plummet as new and exciting tech-
nologies become commonplace.
TABULA RASA: OUR GENOME
These tools for modifying genetic sequences are very
useful; we must know what it is, however, that we're chang-
ing. The substrate for genetic manipulation-the blank canvas
on which gengineers work-is the genome, the DNA "blue-
print" that describes a living organism. For metahumans, our
genome is massive, but not all of the genetic sequence trans-
lates into protein-building information. There are large seg-
ments of our DNA that have other functions, or often no
apparent purpose at all.
Of the three billion base pairs in metahuman DNA, only 3
percent are functional sequences-genes that encode com-
plete proteins. Other base pairs form control sequences:
enzyme binding sites, start and stop signals that initiate or pre-
vent transcription, recognition sites for restriction enzymes and
so forth. The remaining sequences-most of the DNA-have
indirect functions. Some are vestigial genes, obsolete genetic
options bypassed by the process of evolution. Many other
sequences do nothing at all. The remaining sequences, though
never expressed as proteins, control the three-dimensional
structure of the DNA molecule.
In biochemical terms, the primary structure is the
sequence of components that make up a molecule. For pro-
teins, that's the order of amino acids; for DNA, it's the num-
ber and sequence of nucleotides. Secondary structures are
small repeating 3D elements, where the helix will sometimes
curl into spirals, loops or rippling folds. The next level is the
overall 3D conformation of the DNA-it may be drawn as a
nice straight regular helix, but in reality that helix is a piece of
string tangled up into a complex knot, and the knot's physi-
cal shape is "tertiary structure."
Initially, the phrase "junk DNA" referred to all the non-
coding sequences of our genome. Geneticists now under-
stand that the regions controlling secondary and tertiary
structure are vital to the function of our DNA, and only the
vestigial genes and other useless sequences are now con-
sidered "junk."

"I am everywhere!“
The Awakening left massive changes behind as it rippled
through our world half a century ago. It changed society, it
changed the borders of possibility, but most of all it changed
us. On a genetic level, up to a quarter of the world's popula-
tion would never be the same again.
Metahumanity
The rise of metahumanity in 2011 was the first visible
evidence of the Awakening and perhaps the change that
touched more lives than any other. It was immediately rec-
ognized as a genetic effect, as the name UGE-"unexplained
genetic expression"-shows. Geneticists of the world
jumped on the academic bandwagon, and research began
immediately into this strange phenomenon.
That's an understatement. There's nothing scientists hate
more than the unexplained or the inexplicable, especially
when it's right in their backyards. By the first decade of this cen-
tury, genetic scientists thought they had it all figured out, and
then along came UGE to prove them very, very wrong. Just
about every corporation and government in the world poured
buckets of money into finding out what on earth was going on.
· Doctor Karl
· Yeah, and half the time they were just happy to get results
however they could. Questionable ethics, sloppy methods; it
was a bad couple of decades for scientific pride. Industrial
espionage was at a premium, too-the first generations of run-
ners had it made.
· The Smiling Bandit
"Strikes Again! Ha Ha Ha!"
Magic's impact on genetic expression-still not under-
stood at that stage-meant that the search for the "metahu-
manity" genes was doomed to be problematical and lengthy.
The incidence of a second wave of UGE, the "Goblinization"
of 2021, further complicated matters by providing a whole
host of new genetic traits to identify and sequence.
The "metagenes," as they were tagged, defied identifi-
cation and comprehension for several decades. It wasn't until
the 2040s that several key breakthroughs allowed full identi-
fication of a genome's secondary DNA structure along with
its primary DNA sequence. The landmark Hausen Project of
2046-47 combined genetic and thaumaturgical research and
finally yielded useful results.
Just as a two-dimensional square is a shadow of a three-
dimensional cube, and a cube is a shadow of a four-dimen-
sional tesseract, magical energies that exist in four dimen-
sions (our usual three dimensions in intersection with astral
space) have three-dimensional shadows. Such shadows may
appear to exist without their extradimensional component,
but are meaningless without the presence of magical energy.
This is precisely the case with the genes for metahuman-
ity. The researchers of the Hausen Project discovered that
particular repeating secondary structures were common to
many members of a given metatype. They developed this
observation into a theory postulating that these secondary
structures are three-dimensional shadows of genetic ele-
ments active in four-dimensional reality, that they are confor-
mational requirements for transcription of previously inactive
genes. Stringent laboratory experimentation has supported
this theory, but the actual mechanism behind the activation of
these genes is unknown to this day.
After the Hausen discoveries, it was later determined
that the metagenes for ork and troll metatraits, while requir-
ing higher levels of ambient mana to express, would do so
suddenly even in existing organisms. The elven and dwarf
metatraits, however, established themselves during fetal
development, and organisms will not express the nobilis and
pumilionis traits after differentiation has occurred.
· So does that mean if you had a child somewhere without
mana-say, in space-and then took them into a normal level
of magic, they might suddenly turn metahuman?
· Voider
. Absolutely. They wouldn't become an elf or a dwarf; if you're
not born that way, you'll stay human forever. But spontaneous
expression into robustus or ingentis is definitely possible.
· Doctor Karl
So as geneticists currently understand it, various sec-
ondary structures-nicknamed "astral shadows" thanks to the
four-dimensional nature of their activity-trigger the tran-
scription of DNA sequences previously thought to be inactive
or "junk" DNA. These DNA genes directly encode proteins
responsible for the physical differences between the five
metatypes-there are different combinations of genes that
encode pointed ears, exceptional stature, heat-sensitive
sight, calciferous dermal deposits and so on. Without the
required secondary conformations, a person will never be a
metahuman-even if they have the appropriate genes. And
without the right genes, all the astral shadows in the world
won't make you a dwarf.
The complexity of the interactions between astral shad-
ows and the primary DNA sequence has made metagenics-
the genetic study of metahumanity-a very complicated
practice. Not all the secondary structures that activate gene
expression have been identified yet, and the specific purpos-
es of the genes they trigger are equally elusive. Though meta-
genic research proceeds apace, there is much yet to learn.
. This is why it's so hard to research metatraits. When it comes
to ordinary genes, that's easy enough-you replicate the DNA
sequence in a controlled environment, provide the transcrip-
tion and translation mechanism and test the protein that
comes out the other end. Metatraits are a lot harder to iden-
tify-it's almost impossible to get the secondary structures
right, and without them the genes for metatraits just won't
activate. You just can't grow pointy ears in a petri dish, it
seems.
· KAM
. In the five years after the Hausen project, they managed to
Identify seven specific metatraits. In the decade after that,
they pinned down another thirty-three. Of course, that means
there's only a couple of hundred left to go ...
· Needle
· Couple hundred? How do you figure?
· Skeptic
. A "metatrait" can be anything from "pointy ears, dwarf-
style" to tusks, horns, good night vision, whatever. But a lot of
metahuman characteristics are really more than one trait-for
example, the increased bulk of your typical troll is actually
comprised of wider bones, stronger tendons, larger muscle
mass, increased height and so on. Each separate trait is
encoded by at least one new gene, possibly more. And when
you consider how many distinct characteristics each
metatype adds to the human experience, that's a lot of
genetic research to do.
· Blastoma
· | came across some interesting metagenics results a while
back that the mass media didn't make much of. Apparently
they've discovered that some normal genetic traits are often
inherited along with metatraits. For example, the tendency to
birth multiple children at once is indeed often inherited along
with ork metatraits. Adult trolls have a greater statistical likeli-
hood of being lactose-intolerant. A higher than usual percent-
age of dwarfs are left-handed. And so on. Obviously, it's not a
hard-and-fast rule; it just seems that the relevant genes are
located close enough that they're usually inherited together.
· Trychosope
. Yeah, I saw that-it caused quite a ripple in research circles,
even if the public didn't hear much about it. In fact, some
geneticists are trying to use these results to advance meta-
genics research; they're looking at genetic sequences locat-
ed around the known mundane genes mentioned in these
results, to see if they can work out which linked sequences are
responsible for the associated metatraits.
· Tanaka
. You're talking about heredity-what about heredity of the
metatraits themselves? I've never heard of it, but couldn't you
have half-dwarf half-ork babies, depending on the metatype
of the parents?
· Saevar
· Actually. no. It's a long and complicated subject with tera-
pulses of data online, but here's the gen: because metahu-
manity relies on the secondary structure of DNA as well as the
primary sequence, it's a lot more susceptible to the vagaries of
heredity. When genes are inherited, the primary DNA sequence
often "shifts around" on the chromosome. The genes themselves
stay intact, but of course this shifting really messes with the sec-
ondary structure. So metatype doesn't have to "breed true;"
elven parents might have elf, troll or human offspring. But some-
thing in the relationship between the astral shadows and the
genes they activate means that only one set of metatraits will
ever express, if any. You won't have children that are half one
metatype, half another-or half-human, half-metahuman,
either. It seems to be all or nothing.
· Phage
. And, just to make it more complex ... though all the par-
ent/child metatype combinations are theoretically possible,
many permutations never actually occur. For example, elven
parents don't have troll or ork babies; ork parents don't create
dwarfs, and so on. In practice, children always take the
metatype of one of their biological parents. (Though if the par-
ents are orks or trolls, occasionally the child will be born human
and turn into an ork or troll at puberty. Yes, there's an explana-
tion why. No, I'm not going to get into it. It's pages and pages
of protein biochemistry, so you can go look it up for yourself.)

SURGE
This new wave of genetic expression hit our world with
virtually no warning, turning those who believed they were
now human or metahuman for good into something else.
Though the throes of public hysteria and frenzied anti-mutant
sentiment made it sound as though a mutagenic plague was
twisting everything in its path, the actual cause of SURGE is
far more natural and benign.
Though SURGE stands for "Sudden Unexplained
Recessive Genetic Expression," biologists were quick to rec-
tify the "unexplained" part. Working theories based on initial
observations were developed within mere weeks of SURGE's
appearance. Now, a year later, it's apparent that SURGE is
another genetic expression like the appearance of metahu-
manity that will take years to research and understand fully.
The incidence of new SURGE cases has dropped dramatically
over the last six months, and geneticists are settling down to
study the issue in earnest.
From what we understand, SURGE is a genetic response to
a gradual rise in ambient mana levels since the Awakening of
2011. SURGE cases are classified into three different severity
levels. The first, class one, refers to those whose changes mimic
those of previous waves of metagenic expression-those
who've developed horns, tusks, pointed ears and so on without
fully becoming a metahuman. This class of SURGE action
appears to be due to ordinary metagenics that have been dam-
aged by the passage of time-metatraits that have been only
partially inherited, for example. Geneticists currently believe
that expression of one metatrait triggers expression of the next,
so that all the traits associated with a given metatype express
correctly. In class one cases, however, only a few metagenes are
expressed, as though the genetic mechanism has been dam-
aged over time, preventing expression as a full metahuman.
. | came across one study that showed an interesting pattern
in births lately. Apparently there's been an influx of
"changeling babies" of late, mirroring the peak of SURGE
expression. Since a lot of normal metatraits (especially elven
and dwarf characteristics) are only established during fetal
development, the analogous SURGE traits started popping up
in unborn children. Of course, unlike adult SURGE patterns,
there'll always be a small percentage of "changelings" born
every year.
· Rosemary
Class two SURGE appears to involve the activation of
vestigial genes from previous evolutionary stages; those
affected display gills, fur, reptilian features or varied sensory
organs, for example. This form of SURGE is the most mysteri-
ous, especially since many of the traits appear together. A
person with class two SURGE is much more likely to display
all reptilian or all ichthyic traits, for example, rather than a
mixture of various types. This has led geneticists to conclude
tentatively that class two SURGE is an example of misdirect-
ed genetic expression. By this, they mean that the "astral
shadows" should have encouraged a set of ordinary metahu-
man traits to develop, but due to genetic shifting over time
the expression mechanism latches onto a set of genes that
were discarded by evolution many years ago.
Class three SURGE is the most extreme, where those
affected display traits never before seen in metahumanity.
This usually gives rise to isolated, drastic changes that have
seen the sufferers dubbed "mutants." Indeed, perhaps they
are mutants-but no more so than a redhead from a family
that has always been blonde. The changes wrought by class
three SURGE are best explained by the effects of drastic
mutation on metagenes-and possibly the magically active
secondary structures. This class of SURGE, like the others, will
remain a mystery until scientists have unlocked the secret of
the meta-genome.
Magic Genes
The area of "magenetics," or the genetics of the magi-
cally active, is a constant frustration to research scientists.
Despite intensive research before and since the Hausen
Project released its findings, there has been no verifiable
progress towards identifying the genetic factors that permit
magicians to channel astral energies into our reality. Indeed,
most geneticists barely agree that there is one coherent set
of genetic factors responsible for these incredible abilities.
The most popular current theory has remained essential-
ly unaltered for a decade or more. It states that the ability to
wield magic is genetically defined just as any other creative
gift or unquantifiable ability; it is conferred by a set of inter-
acting traits spread across the entire genome. These may be
activated by secondary structural elements in the same way
that metagenic genes are, but no one's succeeded in proving
that yet.
Another hypothesis suggests that magical ability may be
encoded in secondary structures that bring isolated regions of
the DNA into alignment. Under this model, the gene(s) for
magic use are fragmented and scattered across a long
sequence of DNA. It's only when the DNA folds and twists
that the disparate chunks of the gene are brought into contact
and become a contiguous sequence that can be activated. This
is just as difficult to demonstrate by laboratory research, how-
ever, as it's nearly impossible to replicate the required sec-
ondary and tertiary structures outside of a normal cell.
With the almost limitless structural elements that could
confer magical ability still eluding isolation and analysis, it
doesn't seem that magenetics will yield to metahuman
inquisitiveness any time soon.

. LoRent
. Well, think about it-who has the power to perform most
gengineering? Do you really want the corps to have the
power to create armies of ubermages? Keeping the world
sane was hard enough when the magic first appeared, and
we've finally found that delicate balance. Can you imagine
the changes if one in ten joes on the street were a mage?
· Magister

be out of our hands, though. Surely the more people who
have access to it, the better.

morality of magic is up to those who wield it. What Magister
was saying, I think, is that leaving such power in the hands of

us do. Further discussions about the morality of magic should
probably be kept to the magic SIGs or MagickNet, though.

GENGINEER ROLL CALL
by The Smiling Bandit
Seems I have something of a reputation for keeping up
with the doings of the gengineering set. In the interests of
keeping you all alive for a few weeks longer, it's only fair to
share the wealth-so at the request of our good Captain
Chaos I've thrown together this quick primer on the movers
and shakers in this very dynamic field. Of course, it'll proba-
bly be out of date by next week. Still, that's one of the haz-
ards of keeping up with the state of the art.
THE MEAN GENE MACHINES
Most of the corps heavily invested in the genetech field
are familiar names if you've been keeping up with medical and
human-augmentation developments; a strong foundation in
genetic technology is essential if a corp's going to do anything
with bioware, cyberware, medical work or pharmaceuticals.
Partners in Crime: Universal Omnitech & Aztechnology
Universal Omnitech is the corporation to beat when it
comes to genetech. They've always been positioned right on
the bleeding edge, pioneering many of the experimental
technologies and procedures that are now commonplace in
modern metahuman genetics. While they lack the diversified
base and sheer resources of a triple-A megacorp, their con-
stant innovation and dedication has kept them at the fore-
front of the field.
Their position has been strengthened by their alliance
with Aztechnology, whose marketing penetration is backed
up by a substantial research presence of its own. The Big A
specializes in genetech on a mass-market consumer level,
such as cosmetic modification, fertility and contraceptive
treatments and gengineered food products. Alone, it barely
rates as a major player; its collaboration with UniOmni creates
a formidable partnership with the potential to dominate much
of the genetech field.
. The problem with the cutting edge is that it's sharp. To stay
balanced on it, eventually one has to make questionable
decisions that end up with someone getting cut. It's all too
common these days to find medical and scientific ethics
being suspended or compromised for the sake of the profit
margin or market share.

Slow and Steady: Shiawase
The undisputed leader of the biotechnology field,
Shiawase has a firm basis in pure genetics research. Its position
is largely due to the Shiawase Biotech division, led by Etsu
Powicke-who is charitably described as a visionary, but more
commonly referred to as a mad scientist-but the Envirotech
division also contributes a knowledge base strong in agricul-
tural genetics. Shiawase products may not be innovative or
totally cutting-edge, but their perfectionism and productivity
has kept them at the forefront of modern genetech.
· Just like everything else Shiawase does: same old, same old.
And part of the "same old" is Shiawase's formidable industrial
espionage capability. They may not innovate much, but
they're quite happy to keep up with the Joneses any way
they can.
· Lone Gunman
Meta-Hot: Yamatetsu/PensoDyne
Yamatetsu are the all-rounders when it comes to "ware"
of all kinds. Their strength in biotech and cybernetics has
necessitated a strong showing in genetics research, and they
excel in applied genetech of all kinds. They're one of the
industry leaders in the hotly contested metagenics field, and
stay almost as close to the state-of-the-art as Universal
Omnitech. Their PensoDyne research institute excels in theo-
retical genetics and specialized applications, and is rapidly
developing a reputation for genetech that "pushes the enve-
lope" in unexpected ways.
· Yamatetsu and PensoDyne were all over the SURGE thing as
soon as it happened, too, which was great publicity for them.
Surprisingly, they actually helped calm the mass hysteria and
panic with a series of intelligent and nicely spin-doctored PR
releases. I suppose chaos is bad for the bottom line.

PRO DABBLERS
Of course, no one's going to leave genetech for the big
boys-all you need is a biology lab and a couple of moder-
ately talented research scientists, so there are genetic
research institutes everywhere you look and more estab-
lished every week. Some of the most productive participants
in the rat race are listed below.
Cross Biomedical
There's not much to say about Cross Biomed except
they're young, hungry and aggressive. They'll beg, borrow or
steal the research data and personnel they need to get ahead
in the field, and it's paying off already-Cross is developing a
strong reputation in the field of neurological and develop-
mental genetics, in particular.
· Cross has been looking at developmental biology in particu-
lar; for starters they're about to release details of a revolution-
ary procedure aimed at speeding gestation for busy mothers
who don't have time to do it the natural way. I should know-I
stole it for them.
· Dirty Habit
Tan Tien
Tan Tien occupies a specialized niche in the genetics
research market. Rather than developing their own research
strategies and ways to exploit their results, they tend to per-
form research as a contractor for other corporations. They do
carry out some of their own development work, but any
lucrative results are usually licensed to another corporation-
often fellow PacRim allies.
· When it comes to innovation, Tan Tien has it all over most of
the big guys, in spades. They've got the hottest researchers
and the best facilities, funded under contract from the corpo-
rate monoliths that they're busy undercutting. As soon as
they've got the wherewithal to go it alone, expect to see
them enter the industry proper with a big bang.
· Saline
Proteus AG
Though they're not widely diversified in genetech, Proteus
is notable for its total dominance over the environmental-mod-
ification market. They began by developing bioware for under-
water environments and have expanded into genetech prod-
ucts for almost any hostile environment you could think of.
They also do a nice sideline in pollution-control gengineering,
though this is mostly to get around draconian ecological laws
in a lot of their most lucrative territories.
· Hostile environments? Hey, do they have something to get
me through dinner with my mother-in-law?
· Titan
Saeder-Krupp
This heavily diversified juggernaut naturally has fingers in
the genetech pie. Its eminence has been limited by a preoc-
cupation with research into metagenics, magenetics and
other genetic aspects of the Awakening. The complexity of
this field has stopped Saeder-Krupp from shining so far-but
if they ever make the magic breakthrough they're searching
for, they'll dominate the market for decades to come.
· The German giant has been playing with some really freaky
stuff. One recent project was rapid genetic change through
magic-no more lying in a tank for months, just use magic and
presto, you're somebody different. Like, I heard about these
things that would sample your DNA, use magic, and become
like a clone of you. Straight away. Scary stuff, neh?
· Grassy Gnoll
· Unlikely stuff, more like. What you "heard about" was proba-
bly just a really good Physical Mask spell, or something similar.
· Terwilliger
. Yeah, but these things even had the same memories and
personalities as the subjects they were copying!
. Grassy Gnoll
. Then that's waaaaaay out of the realm of genetics. They still
haven't managed to quantify personality, but it's accepted
that genetics aren't solely responsible for what sort of person
you are. And as far as memories go, that's a matter of neural
patterning and imprinting: genetic modification won't do a
thing for your memories.
· Dyspeptic Sceptic
Biogene/Yakashima
Yakashima's progress in the genetech arena has been
dogged with as much controversy as in biotech; there are
constantly rumors about their unethical research goals and
procedures, and they've been the target of a lot of runs-
most probably sponsored by law-enforcement agencies or
pro-metahuman activist groups. Their focus appears to be
applied genetech in the bioware and biotechnology fields.
Rumors about their interest in proscribed gene warfare
research also proliferate, but that may be down to their
already bad reputation.
. He's understating the case; they've practically painted a
bullseye on their foreheads. These days you practically have
to take a ticket to get in the door at a Yakashima facility after
dark, there are so many teams leaving with hot property
under their arms.
· Thumper
· Biogene was busy working on protein modifications in syn-
thesized human flesh to make it edible for ghouls, apparently
going for the bequest in the Kindly Dragon's will. Word has it.
though, that someone stole their samples and data lock stock
and barrel, along with the talented people who were making
It happen. Expect some really nasty retaliation runs from
Yakashima when some other corp pops up to claim the
bequest with Biogene's swiped data.
· Fletch
. Yakashima, friend to the Awakened? That doesn't quite
scan. Was Biogene doing this on the quiet, or something? This
really doesn't sound like Yakashima's bag.
· Tuskadero
· Well, who knows, but I've heard one use of it that does sound
like Yakashima's style-nouveau cannibalism. That's right,
chummers, apparently in certain social circles it's now de
rigueur to chow down on synthetic human flesh, supposedly to
show that you're an appropriately ruthless predator to mix in
their strata. Sick frags, the lot of 'em.
· Glaive
AG Chemie Europa
This European giant is heavily invested in genetech
through General Genetics; they also operate a number of
well-hidden subsidiary companies. They have a bad reputa-
tion in much of Europe for unethical research practices, but
that hasn't stopped their commercial success. Their research
is generally focused on medical and pharmaceutical-related
genetech, rather than human enhancement.
· AG Chemie are one of the major offenders when it comes
to violating the 2041 Copenhagen Accords, which proscribe
research into gene warfare agents. They've had to divest
themselves rapidly of a couple of anonymous subsidiaries
after embarrassing toxic spills and sabotage brought some of
their less-than-ethical interests to the attention of the various
regulatory bodies.
· Kaiser
Monobe International
Monobe has been pushing to improve its double-A sta-
tus for several years now, and its strong showing in the
genetech arena is a large part of this strategy. Their acquisi-
tions in the wake of Fuchi's collapse gave them a solid foun-
dation for launching their aggressive new genetech program,
and they've been biting large chunks off Aztech's mass-mar-
ket consumer base. Through their Designer Genes subsidiary,
they've been busy convincing everyone that they need
genetically perfect babies and pets that'll live forever.
· Monobe's receiving a lot of covert support from the other
Japanacorps-within reason, of course. They've had some
very sweet licensing deals, and have conveniently stumbled
over a lot of research data last seen in Yamatetsu laborato-
ries. How long the honeymoon lasts is another matter, though.
If Monobe gets any stronger, Shiawase is likely to see them as
a threat.

DISCUSSION FORUM
. So, now that you've all got the gen on who's doing what to
whom and how, I'm sure you all have some interesting ques-
tions to ask and stories to share. I know we've got some self-

these forums of late, so we all have a chance to learn some-
thing new. The forum is now open for discussion.

. Most people don't realize that gengineering has been around
for seventy years or more now; it's always been a hotly pursued
field ever since they started trying to eliminate congenital dis-
eases from artificially fertilized embryos. A lot of the early work
went into stem-cell research, but the real hot-button issue was
always cloning. Even though it seems innocuous and imperson-
al, when you're talking about a new heart in a tank or clonal
techniques used in fertility treatments, people have always per-
sisted in worrying about the extreme ends of the scale. Armies of
cloned supersoldiers, coming to take over the earth. Hah.
· Terwilliger
· Cloning was a big barrier for genetech to break. Back when
it was first developed, it caused huge ethical debates all over
the world. It's hard to imagine how there could be any
debate about a technology that could grow new eyes for
starving children who went blind through malnutrition or
ease, but this was back before the chaos of the early twer
first century. Maybe they had the luxury of ethics back the

Unethical, my genetically perfect ass! Fixing medical proble
has to be a good thing, right?
· Thumper
· Oh, there have been enough abuses of cloning technolo
to warrant concern. Stories still persist of people trying to c
ate clones of themselves, though there are no reliable repc
of success. Which is probably a good thing-a viable clo
would cause more legal problems than we have lawyers
solve, I think. Is a clone an independent entity, or is it just
expression of your genetic code-and hence, are you respc
sible for anything the clone does? I think it's probably a go
thing that it's still in the realm of science fiction.
· KAM
· The trouble with cloning is that it puts the power of life al
death in our hands on a more exacting scale than ev
before. We've never had the right to impose our wills
nature like this; to do so is to challenge the natural order
things. Apart from the fact that I wouldn't trust my next-dc
neighbor to pick out matching socks in the morning, let alor
trust him with the power to decide what his unborn daughte
genetic makeup should be, it's not our decision to make. TI
is the kind of random chance best left to nature, and God.
· Egwene
. Oh, you had to go and bring God into it, didn't you? Loc
we've evolved enough to have these tools and abilities; hc
do you know that wasn't part of God's plan? You don't knc
any more of His (or Hers, or Its) will than the rest of us. If God wc
ried about the specifics of our actions, rather than the inte
behind them, he'd be a micro-manager-and a micro-mana
er wouldn't have let this world get into such a terrible state.
· Rothschild
· Enough. No debating theology here, please. Religio
debates can be carried over into one of the side forums
taken to private messages. No one's managed to come
with any answers to these ethical quandaries in the last ce
tury, so I doubt we're going to have a sudden religio
epiphany in the middle of a forum for professional criminc
and anarchists.
· Captain Chaos
"I am everywhere!"
· KAM, I know you contend that "clone doubles" are all rumor
and myth, but I'm not too sure of that myself. Sure, the reports
may not be substantiated or provable-but we all know that
most corporate research isn't substantiated anyway, thanks to
the overriding urge to beat the competition. There are too
many stories of "doppelgangers" running around to ascribe it
all to hearsay and speculation.
· The Smiling Bandit
"Strikes Again! Ha Ha Ha!"
· If you say so. Personally. I think most of the reported incidents
are just as easily explained by other, more plausible explana-
tions. I'd class "Clones Among Us!" stories along with Jet Black
sightings and reports of little green men from Mars, myself.
· KAM
· I heard a rumor about an interesting application of
genetech that, if true, could put a whole new spin on a whole
lotta things. Some chummers bagged a courier that was car-
rying some heavy data between a subsidiary and mama
corp-the sort of drek that needs personal security. They got
everything offa this guy and delivered the goods, only to be
told next day that they weren't to be paid because they did-
n't actually snag the info the Johnson wanted. Not only that,
the data still got through to home base! Seems the sucker
had the information "written" in his DNA. Can anyone confirm
this, or is the Johnson just looking for inventive ways of screw-
ing my pals?
· Pilgrim
. No, the Johnson's not trying to screw your pals-well, he
might be, but not like this. Apparently they can resequence
your junk DNA to carry simple messages instead of just ran-
dom genetic data. Each codon refers to an amino acid,
right? Well, amino acids are abbreviated as letters of the
alphabet and since there are twenty of them, there are only
six letters you can't use if you're coding a secret message into
someone's DNA. No B. J. O. U, X or Z. And that limitation's easy
enough to avoid anyway.
· Phage
· The first few times they tried this, they caused horrible physi-
cal results in the subject. There's not much DNA that's truly
useless, after all, and there's plenty of structural elements that
we haven't fully identified yet. Messing around with DNA, even
"junk." is a dangerous business if you don't know exactly what
you're playing with.
· Hacksaw
· Hah. You want interesting applications of DNA? Just do a
quick Matrix search for "DNA Banks" and prepare to be horri-
fied. Apparently there are any number of organizations that
sell samples of other people's DNA-whether acquired legiti-
mately through donation or through more illicit means, they
don't always say. Suggested uses for the DNA range from
modifying your own appearance ("Ladies! Want lips like
Passion Synclaire? Men, want the biceps of the starting quar-
terback for the Seattle Seahawks? They could be yours!") to
having your very own baby with Damien Knight-or his DNA.
anyway. Personally, I don't fancy snuggling up to a test tube at
night, but that's just me.
· Thumper
. And you think there's no place for ethical debate about our
use of genetic technology ?!
· Egwene
. DNA-legging actually pays pretty well, though you have to
be sneaky. A number of doctors are reported to be making a
healthy kickback on the side for taking extra samples from
their celeb patients, too.
· Caleb
· Oh my. Ritual samples for sale. Step right up please!
· Gattacan
· Talking about splicing foreign DNA, corps have always toyed
with the idea of splicing animal DNA into ours to make us
faster, stronger, more alive. The trouble is that no one really
seems to have found a way to make it work yet; the effortless
physicality that so many animals enjoy is more a function of
their whole physiological structure, rather than the effect of
just a few genes. If you want someone to be able to jump like
a cat, buy a cat. It's easier.
· Phage
. That's overstating the case a bit. There have been some
very useful metahuman enhancements derived from animal
DNA-just look at bioware gills or cat's eyes, for example. But
it's true that most of what we have to gain from animal genet-
ics is limited to specific organs or capabilities rather than
merging their DNA directly into ours.
· Tanaka
· Aw, drek. I always wanted to be able to lick my own crotch.
· SJT
· That doesn't mean they've stopped working on animals,
though; the latest work seems to be on splicing one animal's
DNA into another's. That doesn't seem like much, until you
realize you could be up against a guard dog with the agility
of a cat, or the venomous fangs of a snake.
· The Smiling Bandit
"Strikes Again! Ha Ha Ha!"
· Or the horns and claws of a plasma ... don't forget, para-
normals are animals too.
· Meek
. Yeah, but that means screwing around with metatraits rather
than ordinary genes, and that's just as difficult to do on ani-
mals as it is on people. They've had a bit of success with this
kind of work, of course; animal genetics are often simpler than
the metahuman genome, so identification of all the metatraits
is a less arduous task, but last I heard they still hadn't identified
the full metasequence for any paranimal.
· Phage
. A couple of corps are still trying, though; notably Saeder-
Krupp and Biogene. If they've had any success, they're keep-
ing quiet about it.
· Bespectacle
. Holy drek, that might explain what ate my chummer last
week. We were busting into a vet research facility and every-
thing was going fine until we heard a few guard dogs baying.
So we took cover, and next thing there were these flickering
shapes all among us, ripping and tearing and half-gutting us.
We had to drag Chuck out of there, hamstrung and nearly
dead-I laid down suppressing fire, we heard some yelps, and
we beat feet. Guard dogs with adaptive coloration, just what
the world needs.
· Horny Devil
· Sounds more like bandersnatches to me.
· Occam
. I'm telling ya, I heard dogs. And If they really were bander-
snatches, I don't think we'd have got out of there at all.
· Horny Devil
. Do you realize how many logical explanations there are for
what you saw? Spirit concealment, invisibility spells ... little
ruthenium-polymer doggy jumpsuits, if you like. Any of those
make more sense than dog/bandersnatch crossbreeds.
· Occam
· Yeah, but it was a vet research facility. A Yakashima facility,
at that. Doesn't that make you even the slightest bit curious?
Maybe there's been a little more progress into practical
magenetics than that documentary would've had us believe.

APPLICATIONS OF GENETICS
· Our coverage of genetech wouldn't be complete without a
run-down on the practical side of genetech, and its relevance
for you and me. Most of the following is condensed from an
advanced undergraduate review guide, though a few kind
contributors have added details of genetech they feel you
should know about. I agree, and I hope you'll all find this as
enlightening as I did.

PROCESSES
Each cell contains the complete genetic blueprint for the way
the body works; even your big toe genetically "knows" what
color your eyes should be. Genetic engineering processes are
performed on the whole body; for them to be effective, the DNA
in every cell of the patient's body must be altered. Modifying only
certain areas of the body has led to unfortunate results in the past,
including rampant cancers and severe autoimmune reactions.
Gene Therapy
When scientists first realized that our genetic structure
could be manipulated and amended, remedial genetic therapy
was the first application that most people thought of. Finally, all
those hereditary diseases and conditions could be eliminated
from the human condition! While the full potential offered by
genetic revision has yet to be reached, medical science is now
able to offer whole-body "re-writing" for those whose genes
gave them a less-than-optimal result the first time around.
· That's fine, if your goal is to eliminate a genetic predisposi-
tion to diabetes or Parkinson's disease. Not so great if you
want to undo the effects of Goblinization, or revert back from
ghoul-hood. Unpopular causes don't tend to get much
research funding.
· Hacksaw
Gene therapy encompasses a number of different
processes. Using highly specialized nanites, engineered
phages and other DNA vectors, therapists are able to alter
the DNA of their patient to improve the patient's health. This
may involve replacing a harmful gene with an inert equiva-
lent, repairing whole sequences of damaged genes, or
encouraging increased gene expression to speed bodily
processes (such as healing). Changes to the genetic code
must be written into every cell of the body, however, so
gene therapy is still no quick fix. This revision process usual-
ly requires months to complete, during which the patient
must be immobilized under life-support to keep their body
as static as possible.
. You know, this is probably one of the greatest medical
advances ever. Most of us don't realize just what an impact this
has had-if you want an education, head to one of the public
archives and pull down some twentieth-century documen-
taries about genetic diseases. Imagine living with one of
those-Alzheimer disease, muscular dystrophy, Rett syndrome.
Imagine the heartbreak of having kids with some terrible genet-
ic condition. That's something we never have to fear again.
· Doctor Karl
. Maybe you and yours don't, but this therapy doesn't come
cheap. The poor stay poor, and can't afford to do anything
except pass down their genetic problems to their offspring.
When it's affordable for everyone, then you can say it's
changed the world.

Age Rejuvenation
Known colloquially as "Leónization" (referring to the
story of Ponce de Leon, who sought the Fountain of Youth),
this seemingly miraculous technique offers a way to vanquish
old age. It arose from specialized applications of gene thera-
py techniques and has been perfected by aggressive corpo-
rate research and development. Where other genetic
research has stagnated or floundered, progress in rejuvena-
tion research has continued apace.
· Of course it does. Everyone gets old-even corporate fat-
cats. The corporate subsidies for Leónization research prove
that they realize this.
· Saline
Rejuvenation halts and reverses the aging process with a
combination of gene therapy and cellular repair techniques-
it repairs longevity-related damage to protein structures and
DNA alike. It directly opposes many fundamental processes
of biology, however, and its intense impact on the patient's
system prevents unlimited use. Excessive use disturbs the
body's homeostatic balance to a fatal degree.
The genetic therapy must be based on a "clean" sample of
DNA, or it risks perpetuating (and exacerbating) any genetic
damage the patient has acquired. Aging has a degradative effect
on DNA, as does life in industrialized cities, so many children of
affluent families now have genetic samples stored at birth to
allow them to use this treatment successfully when they age.
. All those ritual samples, just waiting to be used and abused.
The next generation of rich kids won't have the courage to
rebel, that's for sure.
· Silicon Mage
Phenotypic Alteration
Perhaps a natural consequence of research into genetic
remedial techniques, there is now a thriving market for
"genetic cosmetic surgery." Where the rich and famous might
once have indulged in skin bleaching, collagen injections or
depilatory treatments, they now choose the wonders of
genetic modification to make these changes at the most fun-
damental level possible.
Your genes control every aspect of your appearance;
changing your look is now as easy-and enduring-as chang-
ing your genes. These techniques can create almost any
transformation you care to name. Eye color, hair color or tex-
ture, skin tone, muscle bulk, skeletal structure-it's open sea-
son for the self-improvement devotees.
Like genetic therapy, cosmetic modifications require a
state of suspended animation while the patient's DNA is mod-
ified across their body. Though the external changes may be
more trivial, the procedures are just as complex and costly.
. The big problem with this is that you've gotta stay switch-off in
a tank for months, a long time to be lying there while the world
moves on around you. That might be worth the effort if you're fix-
ing up cystic fibrosis, but for the sake of bluer eyes? Get cybered.
· Outbreak Monkey
· But there are things you can do genetically that surgery just
can't manage, and the would-be beautiful people with more
money than brains will always shell out for the latest look.
· Malcy
· Phenotypic work is also very popular among sufferers of
male-pattern baldness, which is a genetic trait. This is the best
fix available, since the hair you regrow is your very own.
· SPSM
· Heard good things about this technique from guys who've
used it to bulk up. Unlike cybernetic and bioware augmenta-
tions, where the extra muscle mass can put a heavy load on
your tendons and bones, this technique can just make you
naturally a bit bigger and tougher ... all over.

Environmental Microadaption
Despite humanity's success at taming nature, there are
still many areas of the globe that are inhospitable to human
existence. Environmental modifications were amongst the
first non-therapeutic bioware to be developed, but it soon
became clear that adding gills, webbed feet or sandstorm-
proof skin failed to overcome many environmental limita-
tions. The focus of research shifted into somatic-scale modifi-
cation through genetic reengineering, rather than implanta-
tion of specific organs. Progress has been slow to date-
many of the most useful applications require complete
reengineering of the body's metabolic processes, which is
prohibitively complex-but some limited environmental
adaptations have proven very successful in field tests.
· In English?
· Cino
· Well, as an example, it's hard to tailor a human body to
breathe carbon dioxide, since that means that you have to
rewrite every single part of the respiratory metabolism. But it's
not so hard to engineer a tolerance for hot climates, because
then you only need to replace particularly heat-sensitive
metabolites with more robust equivalents-a much simpler task.
· Doctor Karl
This technique has been used successfully to improve
bodily function in a number of hostile situations. Corporate
interests often use it to equip their workers to function well in
extremes of temperature, low-oxygen environments or with-
out sunlight, for example. Shiawase Biotechnical has also pro-
duced interesting results in their research into pollution tol-
erance, for agricultural and metahuman use alike.
· Proteus AG has been combining this technique with pheno-
typic modification to adapt subjects to zero-G conditions.
Long agile limbs, prehensile toes and muscles that retain their
tone with just isometric exercises. I don't know how successful
it is, since it's only hearsay-and the same rumors tell that
adapted subjects die under the crushing weight of Earth's
atmosphere when they come down the gravity well.

Direct Protein Synthesis
The very purpose of DNA is to instruct the body to pro-
duce chemicals-proteins, to be specific. The principle of
genetic engineering is to change the genetic structure-and
hence the proteins produced-to achieve a specific goal, while
keeping negative side effects to an acceptable minimum.
Under normal circumstances, the replacement proteins are
designed to effect some change in the body. Certain corpora-
tions, however, have exercised gengineering techniques to
produce these proteins for their own sake. In these cases the
new proteins are selected to produce a physiological effect
rather than a permanent somatic alteration.
For example, PensoDyne Biotechnical has reported suc-
cess in engineering subjects to produce surplus hemoglobin,
thus increasing their oxygen retention and athletic endurance
levels. Other success stories include producing calcitonin to
help those suffering osteoporosis, follicle-stimulating hor-
mone (FSH) to improve fertility, and atrial natriuretic protein
(ANP) to regulate high blood pressure. These techniques
bypass intermediate steps in many hormonal processes,
allowing geneticists to minutely control a particular aspect of
the patient's body function.
. Oh. yes, they're doing this just so we can exercise for longer
or have more babies. Hah.
· Phage
. And the cynicism refers to ... ?
· Cino
. Probably the rumors circulating for a while now about
research aimed at turning people into chemical factories. In
vivo synthesis can be very efficient for complex proteins, and
the pharmaceuticals industry is very lucrative. Hence the
speculation-unsubstantiated, I admit-that certain corpora-
tions have been engineering people to serve as "protein
farms." They tell the poor shlubs they have terrible diseases,
give them nice undemanding jobs out of the goodness of
their hearts, and shuffle them through the corporate medical
facilities every fortnight for "treatment."

DNA Masking
For decades, forensic science has relied on DNA as the
ultimate means of identification; the genetic "fingerprint" has
long been the most exacting and accurate criterion for distin-
guishing between two people. It was therefore a foregone
conclusion that gengineering techniques would eventually be
applied for the purposes of concealment or false identifica-
tion. Though there are no reputable practitioners of this pro-
cedure, certain illicit organizations do offer the opportunity to
those who can pay.
. No reputable practitioners, my chromed and shiny tail. You
can bet that the megacorps have their finger in this pie just
like all the others. For starters, someone has to have devel-
oped this trick, and you need pretty solid resources for large-
scale human genetic experimentation. And don't you think
they'd want some nice, truly anonymous agents to maintain
their precious plausible deniability?
· Thumper
Since mapping the entire genome would be inefficient
and impractical for simple identification, forensic DNA identi-
fication usually involves analysis of core identifying features in
the subject's genetic pattern. Just as physical fingerprints are
distinguished by unique combinations of repetitive elements,
genetic analysts translate and scrutinize highly variable DNA
regions, called Variable Number Tandem Repeats (VTNRs).
Pattern homology between the analysis sample and the sub-
ject's DNA (with a 1 percent error factor) indicates a corre-
spondence sufficiently reliable to use as legal evidence. The
DNA masking technique allows therapists to alter the
patient's DNA enough to avoid a match. Though detailed
analysis may still detect similarity of up to 95 percent, the
clearly identifiable variances indicate a legal difference
between the samples.
Under this procedure, a client is placed in a suspended
state while their DNA is re-encoded, like standard gene ther-
apy. The genetic changes are not to ameliorate any health
problems, however; they are tailored specifically to make the
client's DNA look as different as possible to forensic analysis.
The modifications rarely cause any visible changes, as VTNRs
are located on introns-areas of the DNA that do not code for
any active proteins.
DNA masking poses a significant threat to successful
prosecutions based on forensic evidence, and a number of
law enforcement agencies have devoted resources to locat-
ing and eradicating those who practice it. Unfortunately, the
only way to identify the effects of this process-if it has been
performed correctly-is to compare "before" and "after"
DNA assays. This makes legal identification problematic in all
but the most exceptional cases, which has made the elimina-
tion of this practice all the more important to peace officers
around the world.

introns, the non-coding regions of the genetic sequence-
ordinary genetic manipulation is almost always aimed at the
DNA that actually does something. So just wandering in for a
quick eye-color job won't do the trick, since they don't touch
the non-coding regions of your DNA.
· Tanaka
· Okay, but you could still go in for something like direct pro-
tein synthesis, couldn't you, or one of the other specialist tech-
niques where they do change your junk DNA?
· Malcy
. Yes, and that would probably work. But the important thing
about masking is that it's off the record-it doesn't matter
what it does to your DNA, provided there's no record of your
previous genome that's linked to your name. With legit genet-
ic modification-therapeutic or frivolous-analyses and maps
of your genome are kept on record for medical purposes. So
law enforcement agencies still have access to the informa-
tion. It might take them longer to get it, what with subpoenas
and warrants and all, but at least they can still prosecute.
· Phage
. So, if you don't mind having funky proteins floating around
in your bloodstream, you'd probably be better off looking for
some minor protein-synthesis work where the clinic doesn't
mind "losing" your records in exchange for some compensa-
tion. DNA masking is really torquing off the law enforcement
agencies, unsurprisingly, and it's prompted a bit of a blitz on
underground medical providers as a result. If your favorite
street doc has been lying low, this might be why.
· Hacksaw
. And, just so you know what this technique is designed to foil,
here's a gear blurb from the same publication that covered
DNA masking. This time, the subject is a typical DNA ident
scanner. Models vary; check out the upcoming Yamatetsu
and Mitsuhama spring catalogs for the latest hardware.

Genexpress Assaymatic 5131
Genexpress brings law enforcement agencies the latest in
rapid DNA identification technology with the Assaymatic 5131.
Utilizing a combination of marker enzymes and a scanning tun-
neling microscope (STM), the Assaymatic 5131 can have an
accurate DNA fingerprint sequenced within a matter of min-
utes. The marker enzymes target commonly profiled
sequences within the subject genome, marking them for analy-
sis by STM. Within 1 to 10 minutes the Assaymatic has scanned
the selected areas and produced a concise DNA profile for
comparison with law enforcement databases. The unit is easy
to use, is automated to reduce personnel training require-
ments, and comes with a 3-year manufacturer's warranty.
Results from the Assaymatic 5131 are sufficient to secure an
arrest, but are not conclusive enough for prosecution without
supporting evidence. The Assaymatic 5131 remains a valuable
tool for providing law enforcement agencies with precise DNA
profiles that could mean the difference between a successful
arrest and a criminal back on the streets.

SUBSTANCES
Gengineering efforts have produced a number of sub-
stances with a wide variety of bio-medical applications.
Immunization
Using the wonders of immuno-engineering, medical sci-
ence is now capable of conferring near-immunity to most
common disease pathogens, toxins and other compounds. In
this procedure, tailored hybridomas are introduced into the
patient's body, where they produce monoclonal antibodies
specifically targeted at a single substance. These antibodies
provide a swift response to that foreign contaminant,
bestowing significantly improved resistance on the patient.
Patients can be immunized in this fashion against all com-
mon bacterial infections, toxins and other harmful chemical or
biological agents. The procedure still hasn't been perfected for
highly mutable agents-such as most viruses-and, being highly
specific, immunization against one compound confers no immu-
nity to anything else. Also, basic immunization is ineffective
against neuro-toxins and other swift-acting compounds because
they affect the target before the antibodies can respond. It is pos-
sible, however, to immunize against specific neuro-toxins and the
like by undergoing genetic therapy to alter the cell receptors and
neurotransmitters so that the agent cannot bind to them.
· | love my immunization. No more Neuro-Stun headaches!
· Thumper
· Trouble is, you gotta be immunized against everything sepa-
rately. Immunization against Neuro-Stun does nothing against
tranquilizer darts, and so on.
· Glaive
· Didn't they used to offer full-spectrum immunization against
everything. all in one neat package?
· Bespectacle
. Yes, until they found out that it was impractical and didn't
actually work. They couldn't give you specific antibodies
against absolutely everything: there wasn't room in the blood
stream. for starters. Oh, sure, it worked against a lot of common
stuff - but not everything, by a long stretch.
· Phage
· Nail in the coffin was Herbert Lipinski, a biotech researcher
who'd plumped for "full-spectrum" immunization in '56 to pro-
tect himself against occupational hazards. Thinking he was
safe, he got lax about hygiene and contracted about a dozen
nasty bacterial infections simultaneously. He sued, won, and
the resulting damages payout nearly bankrupted two minor
genomics corporations. Needless to say, the treatment disap-
peared from the market about half an hour after that.
· Saline
· These days, research on broadband immunization is focus-
ing on enhanced immune function, rather than synthetic spe-
cific antibodies. There are some nice results coming out of BVI-
Clark Labs over in Boston, for starters.
· The Smiling Bandit
"Strikes Again! Ha Ha Ha!"
· I've heard of immunization techniques being abused for
nefarious purposes, where the patient is immunized against a
compound that's supposed to occur in their body-like, say, a
natural hormone or signal compound. It's never pretty to
watch someone having an immune reaction to his own body.
The end effect varies, but it interferes with normal body
processes in a major (and often fatal) way.
· Doctor Karl
· If you want someone dead, why not just shoot 'em?
· SJT
· Well, something like this would only trigger when the target-
ed compound was produced in the body in quantities large
enough to be significant. So, if it was aimed at (say) adrenaline,
the subject would be fine until they got excited-and then
bang, their nervous systems would suddenly cease to function
properly. Ingenious, eh?
· Tanaka
Protective Agents
Immunization by hybridoma is not always appropriate for
those whose inoculation needs are variable over time. There's
a range of protective agents developed through gengineer-
ing that can be applied for short-term or specific protection,
and are readily available for reasonable prices.
Antibac is perhaps the most common gengineered prophy-
lactic. It's a monoclonal antibody treatment targeted to harmful
bacteria. It protects the body from bacterial infection and toxicity
alike. Antibac antibodies bind to foreign bacteria and tag them for
destruction as part of the body's normal immune processes.
Similarly, they bind to bacteriological endotoxins, render them
inert and direct them into normal waste-expulsion channels.
Binder works in a similar fashion; it's a monoclonal anti-
body treatment engineered to work against chemical toxins.
Binder antibodies are specific to particular toxins and must be
developed and administered separately for each toxic com-
pound. Both binder and antibac are most efficient when
administered by injection, but may be taken as an inhalant for
aerosol toxins and airborne bacteria.
Zeta-Interferon was developed to protect users against
viral attacks. Unlike antibac and binder it is not based on
monoclonal antibody technology, though it is synthesized
from engineered lymphocytes and is therefore tailored to
combat a single virus. Z-interferon will halt a viral infection in
its tracks, stopping virus replication and marking all by-prod-
ucts of the infection for immune destruction. All attempts to
develop z-interferon strains for magical virii (such as
HMHVV), however, have proved unsuccessful to date.
. Basic versions of these agents are available over the
counter in pharmacies. For effective protection you'll most
likely want the prescription-only strengths, which is a good
idea from the diagnosis point of view anyway-assuming you
need zeta-interferon when you actually have a bacterial
infection is pretty useless.
· Hacksaw
Gamma-Anthrax
This is a deliberate mutation of the naturally occurring
Bacillus anthracis. The original bacterial infection causes spore
growth, primarily in the respiratory system but also in the
digestive system and on the skin; g-anthrax is faster acting and
more lethal than this strain. It causes systemic shock on expo-
sure, which serves merely to conceal the true nature of the
infection; the bacteria will incubate for a number of days before
the disease becomes apparent. Symptoms initially mimic the
common cold, developing into pneumonia over the course of
the infection. Sufferers weaken rapidly until death occurs.
· Another nasty supposedly outlawed by the Copenhagen
Accords, so you'd think talk about it would have died down. It
still gets mentioned, though; now why is that? You don't sup-
pose the corps are contravening the Accords, do you?
· Saevar
· Gasp! Never.
· Phage
· The symptoms do look like a bad case of the flu, though.
Makes you wonder how many flu-related deaths are down to
this stuff instead.
· Saline
· Then again, gamma-anthrax would seem as minor as a bad
case of the flu compared to the latest gene warfare agent
doing the corporate rounds. From what I can tell, this little critter
came from Universal Omnitech, who should have known better.
Still, it's cost them dearly-wholesale corporate blackmail, staff
resignations and "disappearances," and more. That's what you
get when you play with Ebola and make it even worse.
· The Smiling Bandit
*Strikes Again! Ha Ha Ha!"
· Mutated Ebola. This just gets better and better.

informed source.

Memo
From: Dr. Dennis Burns, Virology Research Director
To: < name changed to protect the guilty>
I am pleased to report that despite administrative obsta-
cles from certain departments, Strain 74B-2 has exceeded all
our expectations and has responded very well to in vitro
engineering. The test subjects have shown the usual signs of
initial infection-influenza-like symptoms, with occasional
rashes, inflamed eyes and vomiting of blood. These symp-
toms developed fully within 24 hours and spread to the pri-
mary control subjects kept 7 meters away. The secondary
controls, sequestered in a quarantine room, were unaffected,
as one would expect. Each day the subjects deteriorated,
experiencing chest pains, internal and external bleeding-
two of the subjects were bleeding constantly through the
pores in their skin-and many went blind.
At day five, all the test subjects were dead. Autopsies
showed massive shock, liver and renal failure, and liquefac-
tion of many internal organs (particularly the gastrointestinal
tract). By day six, all but one of the primary controls had died
of similar symptoms. The sole survivor recovered gradually
over several weeks, but after re-infection with a modified
variant (labeled 74B-3) he too perished. His symptoms before
death appeared to indicate additional immune failure and
secondary infection. Treatment with standard antiviral agents
did not arrest the symptoms enough to save him.
Since you seem to be too busy to observe our work in
progress, I shall keep you informed of further developments.

GAME INFORMATION
The modifications that genetic manipulation permits are
usually whole-body alterations to the genetic sequence of
every single cell. Specialized, engineered modifications are
usually classed as bioware, though the line between
genetech and bioware can be blurred.
Gamemasters and players are encouraged to research
and develop new genetic modifications within the limits of
technology presented in The Genetics of the Sixth World, p. 9.
The processes and substances listed should provide examples
of possible modifications and their effects on the body and
bank balance.
Characters who elect to have genetic modifications may
undergo more than one procedure at a time. Though the mon-
etary and bio index costs accumulate, the time required is
equal to the longest duration of the individual treatments.
Many of the genetech applications described here are
assigned a Bio Index cost to reflect the changes inflicted on
the character's body. Genetech modifications are considered
natural, not augmented.
GENETIC MODIFICATION BEFORE BIRTH
It is much easier to modify the genome of a few embry-
onic cells than it is to rewrite the genetic code of a mature
body, and medical science has much more experience with
fetal gengineering than any other kind. As a result, genetic
modifications performed in utero are quicker and cheaper
than procedures performed on an adult.
The duration of gengineering processes is reduced by
half when performed on an unborn child, and the cost is only
75 percent of normal. This reduction does not apply to gengi-
neered substances.
If the gamemaster allows it, characters who begin play
with genetech may apply this discount to the price of the
modifications if their background involves such genetic
manipulation before birth.
GENETIC MODIFICATION AND RITUAL SAMPLES
The pattern of DNA is so integral to one's self as an entity
that changes to a character's DNA will alter his or her aura and
magical signature. The aura of a patient undergoing genetic
therapy will gradually change over the course of the treatment.
Once DNA alteration is complete, observers will note that the
character's aura has changed somewhat, but he or she is still
recognizable as the same person by astral assensing.
This change to the DNA will render previously taken rit-
ual samples less useful. They are not totally invalid, as most

nificant enough to make ritual linking more difficult. A
Linking Test suffers a +1 target number penalty for every 0.2
of Bio Index the target has accrued through genetic engi-
neering, up to a maximum of +4.
GENETIC MODIFICATION AND CYBERWARE
Some of the listed gengineering processes are incompat-
ible with certain cyberware and bioware modifications (see
Genetech Compatibility, p. 25). In the event of a conflict
between a genetic modification and an implant, the effects of
the genetech take precedence, as they are natural to the body.
GENETIC PROCESSES
These rules cover the processes described on pp. 18-22.
Gene Therapy
Gene therapy refers to any large-scale genetic re-engi-
neering performed primarily for remedial purposes. Common
applications include replacing or de-activating genes respon-
sible for hereditary diseases, repairing whole-body impair-
ment from neurotoxins or other damage or speeding up sys-
temic activity (such as growth, healing or drug de-addiction).
Gene therapy is a slow procedure. The patient's body
must remain static and inert, suspended on life-support in a
vat of DNA-vector solution. For every month spent in thera-
py, only ten minutes of that time is required for neural treat-
ment; during this period the patient must be unconscious
and sensory stimulus kept to a minimum. The DNA vector is
usually designed to deal with neural tissue first, so that for
the rest of the treatment patients may communicate freely
by means of a datajack or magical mindlink. Those with data-
jacks frequently spend their treatment period virtually living
in the Matrix.
The treatments listed below are the most common
applications of gene therapy; gamemasters should develop
other specific examples as they see fit. Any gene therapy
that affects the entire body-as almost all of them will-will
take at least two months and cost 50,000¥. Such treatments
will also have some impact on bio index; the degree
depends on how large the changes are. Fixing sickle-cell
anemia will have a much smaller impact than restoring a
healthy body to a muscular dystrophy sufferer. Any whole-
body therapy that merely restores the body to its existing
genetic pattern requires a minimum of one month and
30,000¥.
Augmented Healing: In the case of augmented healing,
gene therapy will heal all remaining boxes of damage on the
patient's condition monitor, even if magical healing has
already been applied. In this case, the healing time is reduced
by half. Augmented healing will also restore damaged organs
and regrow severed limbs, though this takes longer (see the
Body Part Types Table, p. 128, SR3).
Note that augmented healing may be applied to charac-
ters with unnatural implants (such as cyberware or bioware)
by using tailored treatment nanites that are directed away
from the implants using a complicated set of control signals
and instructions. In such cases, the cost of the process
increases by 25 percent though treatment time remains the
same. This procedure cannot be used to repair damaged
cyberware or bioware.
Cellular Repair: Cellular repair therapy is used to mend
any otherwise-irreparable damage on a somatic level. This
includes healing the effects of permanent neurotoxin dam-
age, correcting physical Flaws, or repairing Attribute loss due
to disease or severe physical trauma. It can also be used to
reverse the effects of boosted reflexes cyberware.
Age Rejuvenation
Each rejuvenation treatment requires one major therapy
session, followed up with maintenance sessions every six
months for the next three years to ensure that the treatment
has been wholly effective. It may be used at any time before
death. After treatment the patient is restored to a physical
age of approximately twenty-one.
Rejuvenative treatments take longer for older patients, as
there is more aging damage to repair; the base treatment
time is one month, for those aged forty or below. For every
decade of (true) age above forty, the treatment time is
extended by two weeks.
This procedure has a significant impact on holistic health;
it attempts to reverse one of the most natural processes of the
body-aging and death. It may only be performed a limited
number of times before the body's natural systems go into
overshock and shutdown. Even a treatment this powerful can-
not totally prevent the ravages of time-brain chemistry, for
example, must be largely unaltered or the patient runs the risk
of losing much of their memory and acquired motor skills.
Phenotypic Alteration
Phenotypic alteration requires the same treatment environ-
ment as gene therapy, as the process is the same despite the
difference in results. Virtually any change can be effected, rang-
ing from superficial limited alterations (eye color, hair texture) to
gross physical amendment. Note that any alteration that is not
natural for the patient's metatype automatically counts as a
major change when calculating treatment time and cost.
This technique can increase the character's Racial
Modified Limit for Body, Strength and/or Quickness by 1. Each
attribute to be affected requires a separate treatment. Each
can only be altered once. These modifications automatically
count as major changes. Once the treatment is complete, the
new Racial Modified Limit applies in all situations for the char-
acter. This increase also affects the character's Attribute
Maximum for that attribute only (Attribute Maximum is equal
to the Racial Modified Limit x 1.5, round up). Note that this
process does not increase the attribute itself, it just increases
the attribute's Racial Modified Limit.

Environmental Microadaption
Cold Adaptation: Adaptation for cold environments
modifies the subject's metabolic processes to maximize inter-
nal heat retention, performs minute alterations to the chem-
istry of interstitial and cellular fluids to lower their freezing
point, and replaces ordinary metabolites with equivalent sub-
stances less sensitive to low temperatures. It also adds a
number of reaction catalysts to speed up bodily processes
that would normally be slowed at low temperatures. Cold-
adapted subjects often require more food and report extreme
discomfort or hyperactivity in normal climates, especially as
they have difficulty radiating heat (the gamemaster deter-
mines exact effects/penalties). This enhancement allows the
character +2 dice for resisting cold-related damage, and the
character receives a -2 modifier for cold-environment
Survival Tests (see p. 106, Target: Wastelands).
Heat Adaptation: Heat tolerance is conveyed by increasing
water retention to avoid dehydration, speeding blood flow to
allow increased heat diffusion and altering metabolic processes
to use proteins and compounds that do not break down in high-
er temperatures. Those adapted to high temperatures feel slug-
gish at ordinary temperatures and usually suffer high blood
pressure (the gamemaster determines exact effects/penalties).
This enhancement allows the character +2 dice for resisting heat
damage, though it does not protect against burning. The char-
acter also receives a -2 modifier for hot-environment Survival
Tests (see p. 106, Target: Wastelands).
Low-Oxygen Adaptation: Adaptation for environments
low in oxygen replaces a few metabolic pathways with anaer-
obic equivalents. Additionally, an adapted subject has modi-
fied myoglobin in his bloodstream, which retains oxygen
under normal conditions and thus allows him to hold his
breath for longer. The rules for holding one's breath (pp. 47-
8, SRComp) apply, but each success on the Athletics Test
increases the duration by 10 Combat Turns rather than 3. At
normal oxygen levels, subjects suffer hyperoxia, which caus-
es respiratory damage and hyperaccelerated cell aging (treat
as oxygen toxicity, p. 109, Cannon Companion).
Pollution Tolerance Adaptation: Engineering pollution
tolerance relies primarily on modifying cellular receptors to
be resistant to heavy metals and changing metabolic inter-
mediaries to homologues that are not sensitive to heavy met-
als and similar contaminants. The procedure also generates
new proteins capable of isolating and disposing of heavy
metals, and compounds to render organic contaminants and
toxins inert. Characters with this adaptation receive +3 Body
dice for the purposes of resisting chemical attacks from pol-
lutants, heavy metals and other related toxins.
Direct Protein Synthesis
The modification for direct protein synthesis generates a
protein by-product directly into the user's system instead of
triggering the normal regulatory pathways. The genetic
sequence for these surplus proteins is encoded into "junk
DNA" and a simple expression-control mechanism is
installed. Unlike most proteins, these are not regulated by
normal bodily processes; they are constantly produced, and
in extreme situations they may cause more harm than good.
The following proteins are examples of what can be pro-
duced by direct protein synthesis. Gamemasters and players
are encouraged to research and develop other protein
enhancements for the Sixth World. Most genetic modifica-
tions of this nature require a minimal treatment time, mere-
ly enough time to rewrite the body's DNA. The protein syn-
thesis will then increase until the enhancement is at full
effectiveness-approximately one month after treatment is
complete. Enhancements that have a significant physical
effect (such as calcitonin's strengthening of skeletal struc-
ture) require longer treatment to express the physical
changes, but they take effect as soon as the character leaves
the clinic.
Angiotensin: This protein regulates blood flow through
the body. It causes capillary beds to contract and stimulates
water retention. Its vasoconstrictive effect is particularly use-
ful in situations of massive blood loss. When a character with
direct angiotensin synthesis takes a Deadly physical wound
(see pp. 125-126, SR3), additional damage due to blood loss
and shock accrues at a reduced rate of one box every (Body
Rating × 2) Combat Turns.
Calcitonin: Calcitonin enhances bone density and
strength by increasing osteoclast activity and skeletal calcium
uptake. A character with direct calcitonin synthesis develops
naturally strong bones that cannot be detected (unlike bone
lacing). This grants a +1 modifier to Body for Damage
Resistance Tests and prevents bones from breaking under
normal circumstances; they have a Barrier rating of 6.

Erythropoietin: This is a hormone that stimulates pro-
duction of red blood cells (erythrocytes), commonly used as
a performance-enhancing additive in professional sports for
over a century. Continuous generation of erythropoietin sig-
nificantly increases erythrocyte counts and aids in physical
exertion by ensuring a constant supply of oxygen. Characters
with direct erythropoietin synthesis receive +2 dice for all
Athletics tests.
Glucagon: Glucagon is a vital intermediary in the metab-
olism of energy stores in the body; it catalyses the liver's con-
version of glycogen into glucose, ensuring a steady supply of
energy. This is particularly useful for those who exert them-
selves over long periods of time. Characters with enhanced
supplies of glucagon double all listed times when dealing
with the effects of fatigue (p. 47, SRComp). Their health
should be carefully monitored, however, to avoid complica-
tions like diabetes.
DNA Masking
This procedure changes parts of the character's non-cod-
ing genetic sequence so that a DNA scanner will not produce
a positive identification when searching the genome ID data-
bases. When a character with DNA masking has a sample
taken for scanning, roll an Opposed Test between the rating
of the DNA masking and the rating of the DNA scanner. If the
masking and scanner have equal successes, the scanner will
indicate to the operator that further identification is required
by other methods.
DNA Scanners
A DNA scan is usually only employed when more prac-
tical means of identification turn up anomalous or inconclu-
sive results. The results of a DNA scan are considered suffi-
cient to hold a suspect for further investigation, but are not
legally admissible. Forensic evidence for prosecution must be
obtained by proper medical sampling and laboratory testing.
If the scan is performed on a character with DNA mask-
ing, it takes a number of minutes equal to the scanner's rat-
ing-a more advanced scanner performs exhaustive searches
of obscure records, where a basic model will just briefly query
the major local ID database. This time may be reduced by any
excess successes on the Opposed Test, if the scanner wins. If
the scan is performed on someone with no unregistered DNA
alterations, it takes one minute to return the results.

Immunization
A patient undergoing immunization is injected with a
culture of engineered hybridomas, which propagate through
the body and germinate until they have established them-
selves in the patient's system. Though the treatment is
instantaneous, it takes a month for the immunity to develop
fully. The hybridomas produce specialized antibodies that cir-
culate around the body until they encounter one particular
target compound. They bind to the compound, render it inert
and tag it for expulsion in a hyper-efficient version of normal
immune responses.
This cycle gives the subject complete resistance to nor-
mal doses of the particular compound. In the event of
increased or abnormal exposure to the substance, which may
overwhelm the responsiveness of the antibodies, immunity is
not guaranteed. The antibodies still assist in resisting the
compound, however; the Power of the disease, toxin or
pathogen is reduced by half in such cases (round down).
Determining how much exposure is excessive is up to the
gamemaster's discretion, depending on the situation and the
compound in question.
At the gamemaster's discretion, immunization may also
protect the character from very similar compounds, perhaps
reducing the Power by half.
A patient may only be immunized against a number of com-
pounds equal to his or her Body (excluding modifiers for race,
cyberware or bioware). Any immunizations beyond this point
disturb the immune system to the point of failure, with unpleas-
ant consequences. Each immunization treatment is permanent,
as the hybridoma cells are effectively immortal.
Note that genetic immunization shots are not available
against neuro-toxins and fast-acting compounds (anything
with a Speed of Immediate). To immunize against these com-
pounds, the character must undergo cell-repair genetic ther-
apy (p. 26).
SUBSTANCES
These rules cover the substances described on pp.
22-25.
Protective Agents
The listed protective agents are all synthesized in vitro
and administered only when required. They may be applied
before, during or after exposure to the toxin or infection.
None of the agents aid in actually repairing cellular damage
caused by pathogenic attack; this is the purview of genetic
cellular repair or augmented healing therapy.
Antibac/Zeta-Interferon: Antibac protects against bac-
teria and diseases; zeta-interferon protects against viril. If
applied prior to exposure or before the infection's Speed
period has passed (in other words, before the character has
been infected), then the character subtracts the agent's rating
from the target number for any Body Tests to determine
infection and/or the infection's Power for Damage Resistance
Tests. If the infection's Power is reduced to 0 or less, the char-
acter is immune to its effects. Each dose of antibac/zeta-inter-
feron lasts for 24 hours. Further doses of these agents may be
given to grant extended protection.

If the character is already infected, antibac/zeta-interfer-
on will reduce any side effects of the infection to half poten-
cy (round down). Reduce the Power of the infection by the
agent's rating for any Damage Resistance Tests. If the damage
is reduced to nothing, the infection has been eliminated.
The success of antibac/zeta-interferon cannot be deter-
mined until 24 hours after administration. At that point, a
character may make a Biotech Test against the infection's
original Power to determine if the agent has been successful.
Binder: Binder protects against a specific toxin (chosen
when purchased); it is effective against many compounds
that the broad-spectrum standard antidote patch (see p. 305,
SR3) is not (gamemaster's discretion). If applied prior to
exposure or before the toxin's Speed period has passed,
binder provides complete immunity to the toxin's effects.
If administered after the toxin's Speed period has
passed, binder reduces any effects of the toxin by half (round
down) and guards against continued exposure. If the charac-
ter continues to be exposed to the toxin, reduce the toxin's
Power by the binder's rating and reduce the Damage level by
one. If the toxin's Power is reduced to 0 or less, the charac-
ter is immune to its effects.
Each dose of binder lasts for 1 hour; further doses may be
given to grant extended protection.
Gamma-Anthrax
On exposure to gamma-anthrax, the character must
make an unaugmented Body Test against a Power of 8. The
number of successes on this test indicates the disease's incu-
bation period in days; if 6 or more successes are scored, the
character is not infected.
After the incubation period, 1 box is removed from the
maximum (right side) of both of the character's Condition
Monitors every 6 hours. Thus, after 24 hours the character can
only sustain 6 boxes of Stun damage before falling uncon-
scious and six boxes of Physical damage before going into
overflow. The character dies if the Condition Monitors are
reduced to zero. Every 24 hours that infection spreads
through the character's body, the pathogen's Power increases
by 1 for the purposes of resisting treatment and the character
acquires a cumulative +1 target number penalty for all actions.
Correct diagnosis of gamma-anthrax requires 2 successes
on a Biotech (6) Test; fewer successes grant the physician
some clues, while more successes suggest possible remedies
and treatment options. Gamma-anthrax infection is suscepti-
ble to antibac treatment; if the disease is halted and defeated,
the removed boxes are healed like normal combat wounds.
Ebola Plus
Ebola Plus, or Strain 74B-3, is a genetically engineered
variant of the Ebola hemorrhagic fever virus. Unlike previous
strains of Ebola HF, it is spread just as easily by air as by
physical contact. It acts by causing internal cell necrosis and
major internal and external bleeding; the subject usually dies
within five or six days from massive systemic damage and
shock. Autopsies will reveal that victims were almost lique-
fied inside.
On initial exposure to Ebola Plus, the character makes an
unaugmented Body (8) Test. If the character does not
achieve 6 or more successes, he or she is infected with Ebola
Plus. If 6 or more successes are achieved, the character has
avoided infection on this occasion but further Body (8) Tests
must be made each minute the character remains exposed to
the pathogen.
24 hours after exposure, an infected character must resist
8L damage using unaugmented Body only. A day later, the
character must resist 8M damage. The character takes dam-
age every day after this; on day three it is 8M again, then 8S,
8S and finally 8D. The character may not heal this damage
unless the virus is eliminated.
If the character survives beyond this point, the virus is
spent and the character may recover normally. The internal
damage is so severe, however, that it may only be wholly rec-
tified using magic or cellular repair genetic therapy. If the
character heals naturally without this assistance, the damage
to their body is so severe that they lose 2 points of Body per-
manently due to disability. This Body loss may be repaired
later using genetic therapy.
Zeta-interferon is effective against Strain 74B-3, but at
only half its usual strength (round down) due to the
pathogen's immunosuppressant qualities.
Diagnosing Ebola Plus requires a Biotech (6) Test. With less
than 3 successes, the condition may be misdiagnosed as normal
Ebola; if the test fails entirely the usual diagnosis is influenza or,
in later stages of the disease, an "unknown viral attack."

<Accessing: What's New?>
· In a society where information is king, the question "What's new?" pops up the most often.
We aren't satisfied with the now. There has to be something more, something different, some-
thing that will set the world on fire and yet be passé in the next five nanoseconds.
A few colleagues say that this is a sickness that plagues us. Sometimes, when I see yet anoth-
er magician wannabe die from trying out a new and untested theory on a dare, I'm half-inclined
to agree. But it is also this continuous drive for the new and different that keeps us moving forward
and learning. Stagnation has never been one of our overriding traits. The only problem is that we
tend to forget or disregard the lessons of the past and so lose part of the bigger picture.
To put things in plainer language for the attention-deficient
"now crowd": new is not bad, but neither is old. So before you
move on to the meaty bits that you're craving, take your Magic
Theory veggies. Trust me, they're good for you.

MAGIC THEORY 101
by Silicon Mage
Regardless of your background, mages, shamans and
scholars of magic alike can always use an overview of the
basics. Too often, we get lost in the details and need to be
reminded that there are still many things that we simply
haven't discovered yet-and many times the key lies within
the things that we already know.
· Or think we know. Magic is too fluid for us to claim that it can
only act in certain ways. Look at what happened during
Halley's Comet, or the changes we've seen in the past ten
years, and then tell me that.
· BethSheba
. I'm not too sure of that, Beth. What may look like chaos and
an upset in the order of things might actually be natural. We just
haven't figured what patterns or rules of behavior it follows
decisively enough to be able to make that call.
· Magister
. Hermetics! Always analyzing things. Accept that magic just is
and learn to live with it.
· Grizzly
To give an example, we know that in order to track some-
one through ritual sorcery, we must have samples of the per-
son's DNA: blood, skin, hair and the like. The question now is:
why? As in, why is that necessary? Why does that work? And
why is this relevant?
The answer is simple, really. Magic is a science in the
truest sense-"science" coming from the Latin word "scienta,"
or knowledge-and has its own laws, which allows us to pre-
dict its effects to a degree. Just how large or small that degree
is has been in dispute since long before the Awakening, along
with arguments of whether magic is an art or science.
· And it's become extremely cliché as to which sort of magi-
cian will argue for one or the other. We all know that hermetics
will argue for science and that shamans will argue for art. This
duality conveniently neglects that many of us are somewhere
in between. This whole affair parallels some of the debates that
used to (and sometimes still do) go on about religion versus sci-
ence. Both are equally valid; just because I know how some-
thing works intellectually doesn't mean that I can't believe that
I had Owl's help.
· Whisper
So what are these laws? First, if you've ever participated in
ritual sorcery, then you have applied the Law of Contagion:
Things which, having once been in contact with each other,
continue to act upon each other even after they are no longer
in contact.
· Well, that sure would put a damper on, um, relationships.
· Debbie
When conjuring an elemental, do you use a brazier of
incense as your primary ingredient for earth elementals? Of
course not. You'd use a large geode, or maybe a lake-sized
mud puddle because of the Law of Similarity: Like produces
like, the effect resembling the cause. There are a good number
of other laws, such as the Law of Knowledge: The more you
know of a subject, the more you are able to act on that subject.
This can apply to many things, apart from recognizing that
knowing a spirit's true name allows you to control it. The Law
of Association sounds nearly the same as Similarity: If two sub-
jects or objects have one or more factors in common, then they
interact through those commonalities and facilitate control over
one or the other.
And now we come back to my previous question: why is
this relevant? Answer: we have yet to realize all the uses that
could be put to various aspects of magic even with these sim-
ple laws. Those of you still paying attention are likely nodding
your heads and telling me that I'm repeating myself, but it
bears repeating at least for the sake of those with short atten-
tion spans. All of this is for the good and the bad. Go ahead
and read about all the new drek, and then ask yourself how
each really works. Not only might you learn a thing or two,
but you might also save your friends and family the cost of
your funeral.
. Oh thanks, fossil. Do I get to kiss the hem of your robe now?
. Rat Boy
· Only if you say "please." Goddess, this is just the sort of attitude
Silicon Mage was talking about. Young shamans and mages
come into a part of their power and develop a chip on their
shoulder the size of Lofwyr's bank account. Look kid, we've
been there before, we know how powerful you're feeling. We
know you want to know everything right now, especially any-
thing new. The only reason we've stuck around so far is either
through luck or seeing a few friends get buried from stupidity,
either our own or someone else's. Try to learn something before
you make that mistake.
. Labrys
. | already knew this stuff, but I hadda find out the hard way-
an' burn down my doss in the process. I scan ya, Rat Boy, but the
fossil's right, even if he sounds like he's got a focus stuffed side-
ways up his hoop. Just gotta prove to him that sometimes we
got better heads on our shoulders than the rest give us credit for.
· Orkana
. Thanks, I think. A few concrete examples should help illustrate
my point, so read on.
· Silicon Mage
SYMPATHETIC MAGIC
· The word "sympathy" comes from the Greek roots "syn"
(together) and "pathos" (feeling). In the context of sympathet-
ic magic, it means "a sameness of feeling," or sharing an under-
standing of someone or something that allows for many of the
more subtle forms of magic. Sympathetic magic doesn't con-
front you head-on, but rather tends to sneak up and catch you
unaware if you're not careful. What's worse is that it uses your
own things against you in the process.
The next few articles are shining examples of sympathetic
magic in action. The first one, a little reminder about symbolic
links and other strangeness, comes from an old chummer from
way back: a chaos magician named Digitalis.
· Silicon Mage
SYMBOLICALLY SPEAKING
by Digitalis
Here's a tip for you; never get involved with a psycho,
especially if she's a houngan with all the wrong contacts.
As you've guessed, I broke up with my girlfriend and yes,
she was-is-a scary piece of work. When I hooked up with
her, I was gonzo for her; she was "mad, bad and dangerous to
know." That she knew a variety of people that I might never
otherwise meet, from fast-track suits to other houngans and all
kinds of "Familia" in between, just compounded the problem.
Looking back, though, I should have known. We had been
going out for about two weeks, spending as much time with
each other as we could apart from our studies and obligations
of course. She spent the night with me after some heavy par-
tying at our favorite club, and the next morning before she left,
she grabbed one of my t-shirts and put it on, sticking hers into
her purse. It was a little funny at the time, but I guess even then
my subconscious was trying to look out for me. I asked her
what she thought she was doing.
"I just want a piece of you," she said, smiling that killer
smile of hers. "Symbolically speaking, of course."
You'd think the potential danger would sink in then, but
no. At the time, I was very happy. The last thing on my mind
was the possibility that she'd use this against me. What can I
say? Her mait tete is Erzulie.
. Ah, the most beautiful and charming of the loa. To know a
woman mounted by Erzulie is to know great joy. By the telling of
your tale so far, however, you have seen her possessive side as
well. She loves gifts. If you had objected, you would have seen
her temper.
· Red Warrior
It wasn't until a few months later, when I began studying
Qabbalistic magic and spending a lot of time really delving into
it, that she began to get very jealous. She'd scream at me,
accuse me of bagging other women behind her back then
come at me with her nails. She even got a few swipes in now
and then, but for the most part I could keep her at a safe dis-
tance until she calmed down. And though I was never the one
at fault, somehow I always ended up buying her something to
apologize. I'm not a rich mojo man, though, so I had to stop
the pattern before I ended up selling everything I owned just
to keep her happy. Her reaction when I told her I wanted to
break up was far from what I was expecting.
"You want to be free of me?" she said. "You can leave all
you like, but don't think for a moment that you're really free."
She was very calm and even smiled at me. It occurred to me
that maybe I should be alarmed at this, but then I figured that
maybe she thought she had me wrapped around her finger and
I'd be back. Tough chance of that, right? Even if I could make
enough money to buy her all the gizmos she wanted, which I
can't since I'm not a corp stooge and legit street work tends to
keep you poor, I wouldn't take her back. Way too tempera-
mental for me.
· Hey, I thought voudoun was outlawed. What's Digitalis doing
messing with this chica, then?
· Bagger
. Only in the CAS, Bagger. Didn't you read about all the hoodoo
durin' the comet fever? Even with as much information as the
CAS gummint has been amassing about the shedim since then,
showin' they're somethin' entirely new, they've been keepin' a
tight lid on voudoun practitioners until they're sure that they
ain't the ones who summoned 'em. While the UCAS, and by
extension Seattle, has been keepin' an eye on them, they ain't
done anything else beyond issuin' that alert.
· CASper
And so, just yesterday as I was meditating and contem-
plating the Tree of Life of the Qabbala, I got that queasy,
uneasy feeling that something was on its way. Someone some-
where was sending something at me. I took a quick peek into
the astral and sure enough, there was that tell-tale nimbus of
building energies. Ritual sorcery. Worse, it looked like a spell
designed to control my emotions-and not just by a little bit. I
spared another look-see around just to be sure that no astral
critters were lurking nearby and then took the full plunge into
the astral. I needed to know who was doing this and from
where before I put up my shielding, though I had my suspi-
cions. I don't like to be jerked around, so I wanted to be able
to find the hoopfragger when it was all over.
I found the source of the sending in my ex-girlfriend's
neighborhood. I was pretty sure, at least; the astral energies
were worse there than I remembered. The source ended at an
astral barrier which looked like a shamanic lodge or hermetic
circle. Coupled with my suspicions about who this was, I
guessed that this was my ex and her honfour. I couldn't see
anything inside it, so I didn't know if anyone else was with her.
Attacking the barrier didn't seem like a good idea, so I went
back and simply shielded against the spell. If I hadn't, it would
have slammed me good. When the danger had passed, I pre-
pared to pay a visit to my charming ex, politely ask her to leave
me the frag alone and take any ritual links to me that she might
still have.
She seemed pretty pleased with herself when I showed up
at her front door. After all, she had to have known that her spell
failed, and here I was anyway. I don't think she counted on me
being well and truly horked, though. I pushed past her and
headed straight towards the place I felt sure her honfour was
located. It made sense that those ritual links would be kept
there. Then she got shrill with me.
"You stay out of there! That is my place!" she shrieked,
grabbing at me. Her nails dug into my arm, hard enough to
draw blood, and she started writhing in that way that said she
was about to cast a spell. Big mistake all around. I shoved her
off of me and she bounced into a wall hard enough to knock
her out. You have to understand; I'm normally a pretty easygo-
ing guy, my taste in women aside, but I keep myself in decent
shape too. She did the wrong thing in making me angry.
· What, does it turn you big, green and ugly too?
· Bruce
I stepped inside the honfour and encountered a tall, dark
and gaunt chummer who didn't seem to be pleased to see me
there. I wasn't there to be nice, though-all I wanted were
those ritual links-so I ignored him and looked for the items in
question. There was my t-shirt and a doll that bore some
resemblance to me, both sitting on an altar, but no sign of any-
thing that counted as an actual ritual sample in my mind. No
hair, no blood, no toenail clippings, nothing with my DNA. Just
my shirt and a friggin' voodoo doll.
That's when it hit me. Somehow my ex-chica had cast rit-
ual sorcery without having an actual material link. All she had
were some items that could loosely be associated with me, or
that were created to look like and represent me. I'd heard of
similar things before, but this was the first time I'd ever seen it
in practice. I've done some research into it since then, and I've
become convinced that it takes a special type of metamagic
common among certain traditions such as voudoun.
What this means is that you may not be safe from ritual
sorcery just because your enemy doesn't have a sample of your
body. With the right know-how, all that magician needs is
something you once touched or owned, a photograph or even
a fraggin' drawing. I guess now I understand why some deck-
ers never want to meet in person-who wants to show their
face when it can be used against them?
· What a wake-up call. Not that I'm not careful with my things,
but it is easy to forget that sometimes someone's desperate
enough to get at you to use anything they can get. Paranoia
doesn't look so bad, now.
· Penny
· Hey Digitalis, don't leave us hanging! Did anything else hap-
pen in the honfour? What was up with the creepy guy?
. JR
. Well, to say that things turned inside out after that would be a
huge understatement.
I was so focused on figuring out how she had used ritual sor-
cery on me that I didn't even notice what else was in the hon-
four-namely, a row of desiccated corpses lined up under the
altar. That brought me back to the present, and I realized Mr.
Creepy had been standing there the whole time waiting for me
to pay attention. He casually reached over and placed his hand
on the shoulder, like we needed to have a talk. But his hand exud-
ed a numbing chill that shouldn't have been possible in a normal
person. I jerked and fell over, kicking over the altar. I looked up at
the man and paralyzing fear washed over me, rooting me to the
spot. I think he even smiled. That's when I blacked out.
· Digitalis
· You have got to be drekking me. You know that sounds like a
shedim, if not a master shedim, right?
· Skeptic
· Skep, I'm as serious as a heart attack.
· Digitalis
. Ha ha ha, that's funny. Oh wait, that wasn't supposed to be a
joke.
· Mandrake
. So then what happened, Digit?
· Extractor
· Well, I came to when the same guy shook me awake. There
was a big difference between this new touch and the one from
earlier, though-mainly in that this touch was a lot more human
and gentler. The story he related to me sounded strange, but
since I wasn't conscious for part of it, it's the only one I have to
go off of.
Basically, he introduced himself as a houngan whose mait
tete is that of Ghede. Previously, he and my ex were working
together and shared the honfour. He had begun to suspect
that she was starting to follow the Petro path, and so astrally
projected one evening in order to follow her to be sure. That's
when "the dark, bad spirit," as he called it, took up residence in
his body. Since it was too powerful for him to dislodge, he says
he went to Guinee and pleaded for Ghede's help. When I
eventually came along, he claims that Ghede mounted me
and drove the spirit off so that he could return to his own body.
· Digitalis
. You mean to tell me that a loa stepped in and took on a
shedim? On its own accord?
· Magister
· Sure, and why not? The shedim are trampling all over Ghede's
backyard and are responsible, directly or not, for his followers
getting in drekloads of trouble in the CAS and elsewhere. It's in
his best interests to answer a call for help in a case like this. What
might be surprising is if a different loa answered the call. Their
followers are in as much trouble, but something like this isn't
quite their bailiwick, you see.
· Dumailler
· Regardless of the truth in his story-and some of it does jibe
with the little I know of voudoun, shedim and such-I was okay.
My ex was still out cold, and the houngan assured me that she
would be taken care of. I didn't want to question what that
would entail-the less I know, the better-so I just asked for the rit-
ual links belonging to me and something to drink. Then I hit the
road
I tell you, though, I'm finding it hard to sleep at night. All I
think about is that she can whip up a new little doll that looks
like me whenever she pleases and send some mojo my way.
She was right. With that hanging over my head, I never will be
free of her.
· Digitalis
· No kidding. Shedim, Tutor and imps, oh my! Add a serving of
"fellow magician." mix it up well and voilá!
· George
. C'mon folks, it's not that bad. Haven't you seen the newest
article in Hermetic Digest?
· Wiz Kid
· Not yet. What's the buzz, Kid?

. It's a new technique. They're saying you can sever the con-
nection between yourself and potential ritual links.

SEVERING RITUAL LINKS
by Dr. Ennosuke Uemura
January 2063, Hermetic Digest
· Dr. Uemura is a top researcher in MCT's Thaumaturgical
Research and Development Department. He doesn't do much
publishing, which makes him an odd bird if he were a university
professor, but he's positively prolific for a corp researcher, con-
sidering most of the publishing the other lab monkeys in R&D do
consists of internal company memos and reports.
· Kensai
It is a foregone fact that group magic, or ritual magic, is a
force to be reckoned with, particularly when the members
composing that group are puissant and knowledgeable wield-
ers of mana. How then is a lone magician to ever stop such a
group, should he ever be singled out for their attentions? It
would seem that, even were our lone magician an initiate of
some tradition with power, he has not much chance to resist.
. I'm not a fan of ritual magic on the receiving end, but get a
grip. Shielding can take care of that.
· Orkana
In observing and testing each stage of ritual magic and
applying the basic theories from the Manual of Practical
Thaumaturgy, 24th Edition, it has been observed that there is a
tangible astral connection between magician and ritual link.
Such a connection may be affected in the same manner that an
astral barrier, ward or other astral phenomena, including spirits,
might. That is, it may be banished or disrupted at least for a
time, after which the connection re-establishes and solidifies.
· How can you people read this on a regular basis? I can't read
this without falling asleep or feeling like I've got bees buzzing in
my head.
· Fatima
. Liberal doses of soykaf, my dear, and turning on the bulldrek
filter. To translate simply, what Dr. Uemura is saying is that you can
sever the link between you and a ritual team. He compares it to
overcoming astral barriers and the like.

one else's taking much more.

It has long been given that a ritual group may use this con-
nection between a ritual link item and the item's metaphysical
owner or source to, in effect, affect some degree of control on
said owner. Dr. Rupert Calvin, in his work Metaphysics and
Metapsychology: Mind and Magic, theorized that this degree of
control is, in fact, bi-directional. Although he used such proofs as
spells which allowed for telekinetic manipulations, which are far
more direct than what this article deals with, when tested in the
laboratory and in controlled field conditions, they largely bore
out his theory and enabled further research in that direction.
· Translation: the link between you and a ritual team goes both
ways, so you have a chance of doing something about it. This
falls simultaneously under the laws of Association and
Knowledge. It also reminds me of a story passed along to me.
I'll post it after we're done with this article.
· Silicon Mage
The full extent of the control a mage may have upon his
link, we speculate, is potentially quite large but not fully
explored. As our research is tightly focused upon the condi-
tions associated with ritual magic enacted upon the targeted
mage, we cannot say what is possible outside those condi-
tions. At this time, however, we can say with confidence that a
mage whose knowledge and experience has initiated him into
the higher mysteries may possess enough control over the link
between himself and a ritual link item to be able to sever it and
thereby negate the sending of a spell through ritual sorcery.
· Otherwise known as you can only sever a ritual link after the
ritual team has locked on to you and while they're actually
sending the spell over. Oh, yeah, and you have to be an initiate
and know how. Nah.
· BethSheba
· Makes sense. You can't sever a link before the link is made,
right? You have to do it after they've zeroed in on you-which
means that you only have a small window of opportunity to
save your hoop. You have to be quicker on the draw then the
ritual team, and if you fail to notice the link in the first place,
you're hosed.
· Fatima
· I've read some reports about a corp magical research group
that will remain unnamed, indicating that they are looking into
some way to prevent the ritual link from ever being established
in the first place. The way I scanned it, they were developing
some sort of masking or invisibility against ritual links, making it
more difficult for the ritual team to tag you. Problem is, they
haven't been able to get it to work yet when they know some-
one's trying to make the link, much less having some sort of "link
shield“ on all of the time.
· Grey Knight
Tests conducted with mages of lesser power helped reveal
the reason why only mages possessing the minimum requisite
experience were able to sever the link. When conducting inter-
views with the control group, several participants noted that in
order to perform the cutting of the ties between them and their
links, it was necessary to engage in a "tug-of-war" with the ritu-
al group so as to exert or seize the aforementioned control over
his or her link item. The secondary group reported no such strug-
gle for supremacy and when asked afterward about this lack,
each individual related that a sign of tension was not even felt.
· Okay, I can understand what tug of war means. So this
means you've got to beat the guys at the other end before
you can sever?
· Fatima
· You're learning. I'm not sure if it's before or during the actual
severing, but the idea seems to be the same either way.
· Silicon Mage
Further studies and tests revealed that a mage may break
his link even if he is unaware which link item is being used
against him, but he has a higher degree of success when he is
fully aware. The time it took each mage to break his link varied.
Careful analysis between each case turned up a pattern which
related to the mage's degree of sorcerous potency; the more
potent the mage, the shorter the time spent on the severing of
the ritual link connection.

. Ugh, the reading is so dry, my mouth is getting parched.
· Fatima
· Agreed, so I'm afraid that even with Talon's kind condensation
of the material, I'll have to stop it here. What this is saying, essen-
tially, is that you can cut the link even if you don't know what
material (or symbolic, as we've seen above) item they used to
establish the link. The more powerful you are, the less time it
takes.
· Silicon Mage
. Here's something I'll bet that article didn't cover. What about
bonded foci? Does severing affect the bond?
· Penny
· Actually the article did. Dr. Uemura said that severing doesn't
cut the bond, it just disrupts the link. This was the one point which
really drew my attention more than anything, because I'm not
sure exactly how a ritual link is different from the bond to a
focus. I'd always thought of them as being the same thing, but
maybe there's enough of a difference to where you can't just
up and cut your bond whenever you feel like it.
· Wiz Kid
· Makes sense to me. A bond represents a pretty big invest-
ment of your power. In my estimation at least, only the invest-
ment into an ally spirit is bigger.
· Sourceress
· You've never written a thesis as an ordeal, have you?

TURNING THE TABLES
by Diana Noctua
. A friend who reads everything related to law enforcement
saw this posted in an obscure journal dedicated to quasi-legal
jobs and wisely decided to show it to me. The biographical
information about the authoress says that she is a shaman who
follows the goddess Artemis, an Idol of the Moon Maiden, and
that she has been a bounty hunter for fifteen years. (Who would
have thought?) The information she presents in here is definite-
ly useful in other respects, so take notes.
· Silicon Mage
I may not be as well known as Andrea McBaine, but I can
tell you that I have at least as many bounties on my record as
she does, I've bagged some of the toughest skips to find, and
I've never lost a skip. Never.
· Just so you can follow what Ms. Noctua is saying, a skip is what
they call someone who is out on bail due to a bail bondsman,
and has skipped showing up for their required court date. Bail
bondsmen only get their money back when the people they
insure show up for their court hearing, so they sometimes need
to employ bounty hunters to bring them back for that hearing.
· X-Star
Anyone who's done a little bounty hunting knows you
need an edge along with the basics every hunter needs (acting
ability, contacts, smarts, good equipment and sheer nerve). My
edge is magic, though some acquaintances say it's stubborn-
ness. Since there aren't many bounty hunters who can also toss
a spell or two, I don't mind sharing a little trick I came up with.
First, you need to have a good working relationship with
at least one bail bondsmen, if not two or three. This trust factor
will get you in and allow for this trick to work, otherwise it gets
more complicated, and complicated means messy. Whenever
your trusty bondsman has a potentially huge bond invested or
the likelihood of a skip is high, ask to tag along when he or she
has a little chat with the investment in question. You know the
one: "Don't skip town, okay?" Naturally some of them take this
as a challenge and do so anyway, which is where we come in.
During the talk-and for this, you have to have a light
touch-you slip a little something into the soon-to-be-skip's
pocket or handbag. This is the hard part, since that something
needs to be small and it has to part of something you'll have
access to later. I've used small pieces of brick from a particular
abandoned building in the Barrens, petals of a flower, even a
strand of my own hair when I was in a rush once. The impor-
tant thing is to also cast a Preserve spell on the component, so
that it remains viable as a potential material link. See where I'm
going with this yet?
If our bond skips, that's when my hunt begins. Gramps
always said, "It takes two to tango," so I just took that a step
further. I whip up a little ritual sorcery and use whatever thing
my planted object was a piece of (the brick building, the flower
or myself, to continue the examples) as a material link to the
component itself. Get it? It's sorta like ritual sorcery in reverse.
Rather than using a small piece of something as a material link
to the bigger thing, I do it the other way around, and use the
big thing to track down the little thing.
. She's crazy. She's talking about planting a potential ritual link
to herself on a criminal! What if the guy finds out and he's a
mage, too?
· Penny
· That just makes my job easier, sweetie. Then I get to track the
Sending, because he's gone and announced his location.
Either way, I win.
· Diana
. The simple solution to that risk is to use something that's not
connected to you. Find a tree in the middle of nowhere in some
park, cut off a twig and cast Preserve on it. Drop the twig in
someone's possessions. Odds are that even if the skip finds the
twig, he won't realize what it's for. Even if he does recognize it
as a potential ritual link, and he tries to track it back, all he'll find
is some tree in a park. Unless you happen to be using the tree
as a material link for ritual sorcery when he comes looking,
there's no risk involved.
· Murphy
So, with a prayer to Artemis and a little luck, I can track the
whereabouts of my planted item. Most of the time it's still in
the pocket or handbag I dropped it, but once in a while the skip
finds it and just carries it around. If nothing else, it'll be sitting
in whatever drekhole he's hiding. From there it's just a matter
of finding out if the skip is home or not. You can either look for
him astrally if you checked him out the first time, or use your
trusty friend, the telephone.
· Could you pull this reverse ritual sorcery trick against a sym-
bolic link?
· Reciprocity Rik
. Theoretically you could, if you knew how to use symbolic links
in the first place. It's trickier, of course,
· Digitalis
· I've used this technique not as a tracking device, but to save
my own hoop from potential ritual sorcery. I took a nasty hit on
a run once and left a nice pool of blood behind at the scene.
Another magician was able to heal me quick, but I knew for a
fact that the crew we had just scragged would use my blood
to come after me with ritual magic. So before I even felt the tin-
gle that told me a sending was coming. I called up my initia-
tory group on the batphone. It was a close race, but I man-
aged to cook away the blood before they had established the
actual ritual link that would allow them to send some bad
mojo my way.
· Eli
· Yeah, but if you don't destroy the material link before they've
zeroed in on you, it won't matter. Once they've established a
connection, they don't need it anymore.
· Junebug
PSYCHOMETRY
· Next we have something coming from the more legitimate
side of law enforcement. Word has it that many outfits like Lone
Star, Knight Errant and even Denver's Zone Defense Force pro-
vide new recruits with a crash course in psychometry, whether
the student is magically inclined or not. The reasoning behind
the mundanes learning about psychometry is twofold: 1) so
that they know how it works on the outside chance they run
into it or need it during field duty, and 2) just in case any of the
mundanes aren't so mundane after all. Although this is a meta-
magic, there's still enough folklore about people who suppos-
edly naturally possess the ability that no one wants to take the
chance on it not being true.
· Silicon Mage
Psychometry is the ancient art of sensing the history of
objects and of the people associated with them. It is similar to
divination in that both seek to discover information using
objects, but differs in its focus. While divination is concerned
with the future, psychometry deals with the past.
The word "psychometry" means "soul measuring." In its
simplest form, it merely involves handling an object and
opening the mind to the psychic and emotional energies
associated with the object. Prior to the Awakening, psychom-
etry was most often practiced by psychics and mediums and
sometimes provided useful insights. Even bastions of skepti-
cism such as big-city police departments occasionally
employed practitioners to aid them (unofficially, of course) in
some of their cases, particularly those involving missing per-
sons or high-profile unsolved murders. After the return of
magic changed everything, a technique that many regarded
as a mere parlor trick took its legitimate place as a valuable
tool. Psychometry has proven useful not just for law enforce-
ment or for its original "fortune-telling" applications, but also
for the study of history, psychology, archaeology and many
other disciplines.
Magical theorists differ on the origin of psychometry's
power; some claim that the visions come from spirits who
then pass them on to the initiate, while others believe that
they are a result of the energies that surround everything in
the world-energies that, similar to magical background
counts, become more powerful in the presence of strong
emotions. This property in particular makes psychometry
useful in criminal investigations, particularly in the area of
violent crime.
· So how is this different from assensing?
· Blarney
· In a lot of ways it isn't. Think of it as kind of a super-powered
version of assensing.
· Elvis
· That isn't quite correct-it would be closer to say that psy-
chometry is a more refined version of assensing. You can get
greater detail using psychometry than you can by simply
assensing an object and, more importantly, you can pick up
past impressions about the object.
· Winterhawk
. You mean if you find half of my Nuke 'em Burger in the trash
at the Stuffer Shack, you can figure out it was me who was eat-
ing it?
· Jenner
· Quite possibly.
· Magister
· Especially if you were really emotionally involved with your
Nuke 'em Burger, Jen.
· Wag the Frog
Psychic Impressions
Psychometry is not an exact art; the way in which it man-
ifests depends on the particular practitioner's sensitivity, mag-
ical tradition and beliefs, and can even vary depending on the
nature of the individual session. Common ways in which psy-
chometric visions might manifest include:
· Emotional: The magician might feel emotions similar to
those felt by people connected to the psychic impression.
· Sensory: The magician might get vivid visual, auditory,
olfactory, tactile and/or taste-related sensations based on the
impression.
· Somatic: The magician's body might react to the ener-
gies. For example, if the subject of an impression experienced
an illness, the magician might manifest symptoms of the same
illness. Irregular heartbeat and increased body temperature can
also occur.
Regardless of their manifestation, the "visions" a practi-
tioner of psychometry receives from an object are rarely
straightforward. She might see a rapid series of disconnected
events, suffer a quick flash of pain or nausea, feel a sudden
overwhelming sadness or receive a brief impression of an odor
or a taste. Standard procedure calls for the magician to record
the session in some way if possible, either using an electronic
device or employing another person to write down the impres-
sions before they are lost. Psychometry can be a physically and
emotionally harrowing experience.
. They're not kidding. Awhile ago I got hired to find a mid-level
corp manager who'd gone missing. I used psychometry on his
old fraternity ring, which we happened to find under the dining
table when we searched the house for clues. As soon as I held
it I started tasting wine, but then after a few seconds I got a
vision of something dark coming toward me and the wine taste
changed to blood. I nearly lost my lunch. Turns out the guy's ex-
girlfriend had bashed him over the head one evening during a
romantic dinner and buried him in a shed in her back yard.
· Cougar
Backlash
Sometimes, the "visions" manifested during psychometry
can bring about violent reactions such as fainting, severe
headache, nausea, exhaustion or emotional distress. This is
especially true if the magician is highly sensitive to psychic
energies or if the object was connected with a particularly
intense physical or emotional event. Rare cases have been
recorded where magicians suffered "psychic wounds," similar
to those inflicted on an astrally projecting magician's physical
body when his astral form is wounded.
It is occasionally possible that a magician will be unable
even to hold an object associated with a violent past-any
attempt to touch the object causes physical and emotional
discomfort that persists until contact is broken. It is still pos-
sible to read such objects, but the discomfort adds signifi-
cantly to the difficulty. In such cases the decision regarding
whether to proceed is left to the magician-if another psy-
chometrist is available, the magician is urged to call him or
her in for consultation.
. Yow. How serious is this backlash? Can you get brain-fried from
it, or are we just talking about feeling like drek for awhile?
· Calloway
I've never heard of anyone dying from it, if that's what you're
worried about. But I speak from experience that it can be quite
unpleasant.
· Winterhawk
. Don't be so sure about that no-dying part-a chummer told
me about a friend of his who tried to read a necklace left at a
murder scene. Just when it seemed like she was getting some-
where, she screamed and jerked her head so violently that she
snapped her neck and keeled over dead. Turns out later that
the murder victim had had her own neck broken too.
· Murphy
. Hmm. Is there any way to intentionally leave a nasty impres-
sion on an object? Sort of like leaving a trap for any psy-
chometrists who come along?
· Twister
· Oh, great. Astral black IC. Just what we need.
· Barnaby
. You'd be amazed at what can be left behind if you know
what you are doing.
· Binder-in-the-Dark
Countering Psychometry
Be aware in the course of your investigations that psy-
chometry is not a perfect tool-as with most magical tech-
niques, there are ways to counter it. Initiated magicians can use
cleansing metamagic to remove traces from objects, making
them useless to a psychometric examination. Even techniques
for erasing astral signatures can make psychometry on those
objects more difficult or impossible. In cases where you expect
to find psychometric impressions and none are forthcoming,
consider examining other objects in the area. As any forensics
specialist is aware, it is very difficult to eliminate all evidence
from a crime scene.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
· Just to show some of you that sometimes there's a life outside
of studying or shadowrunning, I've got an article to show you. It's
from Halo and talks about dueling as a fashionable (and in
some places, illegal) new sport, as well as a tool for dispute settlement. If that wasn't enough, then you might be pleased to
know we've gotten a new metamagic technique called
absorption out of the deal as well. Following that, I've got the
low-down on a new trick that's been developed out of the
mess they call the Yucatán. In order to deal with the ravaged
manasphere, some magicians have developed a technique to
fitter out the bad mojo.

DUELS ARCANE
by Halo
I have to admit that the first time I heard about dueling,
puffy shirts and swaggering swordsmen immediately came to
mind. While the image was entertaining for a while, it didn't
exactly thrill me and make me want to run right out and try it
myself. Add to that the magic side of it, and I was also a little
confused. What did a dodgy simflick or three have to do with
magic? Then a friend, an avid duelist and friend to the occa-
sional member of the upper echelons, clued me in.
Magic duels, or "duels arcane" as so-called higher soci-
ety likes to call them, are based in part upon the seventeenth
century sword duels banned in France during the reign of
Louis XIII. As guns (well, muskets) slowly but steadily
replaced the sword as the premier martial weapon for the sol-
diery, only the poor or very rich held onto their short swords,
sabers and rapiers. Proponents of the sword held that guns
were the province of the coward, who had only to propel
without skill a bit of metal at his enemy from a distance to kill
him. Swordsmanship was lent the qualities of nobility, honor,
courage and skill. The aristocracy participated in dueling
more often than the poor because of these notions. The poor
would duel more out of desperation or need, such as holding
onto some bit of property or avenging a female relative's
damaged "honor.
· Damaged honor? Is that supposed to mean what I think it
does?
· George
· if you mean "taken against her will" and possibly ruined for life,
then yes.
. Labrys
. Halo has left out dueling for the sheer thrill and challenge.
There's nothing like the sound of steel ringing in the pre-dawn
air within a stone's throw of the Tuileries.
· The Laughing Man
"Ha! Fraggin' Ha!"
So flash forward to our post-Awakening, post-comet
times, and you more or less have the same thing going on.
There are differences, in that magic isn't going to be outmod-
ed any time soon and our aristocracy has titles like "CEO" or
"Vice President" instead of Marquis or Duke, but the situation
is essentially identical. The ivory tower dwellers who practice
magic now look to dueling as a fine tradition to uphold. One
organization which seems to favor dueling the most is the
Illuminates of the New Dawn.
· Dr. Rozilyn Hernandez in a puffy shirt is a scary picture, Halo.
Thanks. I think I'll listen to the soothing sounds of handrazors
scraping a stainless steel sink now.
· Magister
. IOND? I always thought that "New! New! New!" was their mat-
ing call, not "Tradition." What gives?
· Whisper
· The plain truth is that their overblown egos are in love with
dueling. It lets them show pretty definitively who can put the
squeeze on who within their organization, a little like a pack of
wolves sorting out who is alpha, who is beta and who is the runt
of the pack. They just like to wrap it up all pretty in tradition and
top it off with the shiny but trite claim that you can't build a New
World Order without giving a nod to the Old Guard.
· Miss Tick
. It's not just the IOND, though; a lot of other magical orders,
especially in some university circles, are all said to have their
share of duelists. Supposedly they even have super-secret
competitions between each other, with the winners getting
whatever new magical prize they're squabbling over at a
given time.
· Conspir-I-See
The Illuminates have even formally outlined the conditions
for a duel. Condensed and paraphrased, they are:
1. The challenged dictates the terms of battle, which a
challenger must accept. This includes the size of the area to be
warded for the duel, limitations on spellcasting or foci use, the
day and time of the appointed duel, whether spectators will be
allowed or not and the winning conditions. Win conditions to
choose from are: to unconsciousness, to incapacitation, first
blood, whoever first scores a hit (which could be as mild as a
sudden headache or as severe as a fatal wound), a certain num-
ber of hits and so on.
. They don't advertise it since it's illegal, but "to the death" is
also an option.
· Thanatos
2. The area to be set aside for dueling must be warded in
such a way as to prevent attacks from spilling over to specta-
tors, as well as prevent outside magical interference.
3. Both challenger and challenged must agree upon a
third party to mediate or judge the duel. The judge inspects the
ward(s), assures that challenged and challenger have agreed to
the terms set and are properly prepared for the duel, is the final
arbiter as to when a duel must end and ensures that either con-
tact information for next-of-kin or medical personnel and
equipment are available afterward.
4. Challenged and challenger shall each have a minimum
of one, but not more than two, seconds. The second will be the
proxy for the challenged or challenger, as appropriate, should
something happen to him or her. The second also acts as
another witness to the duel and frequently is custodian for the
challenged or challenger's equipment or possessions for the
duration of the duel.
5. Only the challenger and the challenged fight in the
duel. At any point if a third party joins in or an additional fight
breaks out between seconds, the duel is halted immediately.
6. Each party must salute before beginning the duel and at
the end of it, if capable. Should the duel be set up to resolve a
dispute, each party must accept the outcome and pay the
appropriate penalties, if any.
· And you better believe that they take it all very seriously. I've
dueled against one of these fraggers and he was very peeved
to know that I wasn't aware of some of the rules they use. The
way he carried on, I was born in a sewer and had all the man-
ners and intelligence of a hungry piasma. He calmed down
quickly enough when my first volley slammed him. It was gently
explained to him afterward that not everyone uses the same
rules and he'd be happier remembering that next time.
· Flynn
· Something that hasn't been mentioned yet but should be is
that there are actually two kinds of duels. One is the type that
the magical orders love more, called supremacy duels (which
others call "scorching" because it can burn out your magic).
The other type, which is more commonly seen, is sorcerous duels
where spells are tossed back and forth. While you'd never want
to accidentally get involved in one or the other, at least you
could walk away from a sorcerous duel with your magical abil-
ity more or less intact.
· Raven
Duels on the street are entirely different. They don't tend to
have many rules or safety conventions. Not a lot of gangs have
mages in their ranks, but the few that do, especially wizzer gangs,
love to use dueling as part of resolving their turf wars. They turn
it into an impromptu spectator event, even charging admission
when they need a fundraiser. These events tend to have a little
more structure to them and so they're a little less likely to spill
over into the general public, though spectators have sometimes
suffered backlash when the spells fly fast and thick. The free-for-
all duels in the middle of the street, however, are what have alert-
ed law enforcement agencies and led to mage duels being
banned in some places, particularly Seattle, San Francisco, Los
Angeles, New York and Boston.
. This hasn't stopped establishments from profiting, though.
There is a network of underground mage duel "arenas," some of
which operate even where dueling is still legal, like Las Vegas.
Much like underground blood sports, which have a circuit of
back rooms and other hidden fighting pits, some duelists
become big names on the circuit. Organizations like the Mafia
and the Yakuza organize the fights and book the bets. You have
to be very good to remain on the circuit, though, because it's
very easy for a magician to permanently burn out his magic
with constant dueling.
· Hammer
Absorption
Perhaps not surprisingly, a new metamagical technique
arose from all this. Unlike a majority of the metamagics,
absorption allows you to go a little more on the offensive than
the defensive. As it was explained to me, absorption is similar
to shielding or reflecting in the way part of it works. Where
your defenses would normally either allow a spell cast at you
to flow harmlessly away or send it back to its caster, absorption
turns your defenses into a funnel or a sieve. This lets you soak
up the mana powering the spell without being affected by it,
and then you can turn around and use that along with your nat-
ural juju to really piledrive your opponent.
· Oh wow, so this is what I saw. I was watching one of those
duels to the death in Vegas, and Jorge Alonzo Rodriguez had
done a little song and dance right before he tossed a killer
lightning bolt at Padraig Maciniss. I thought that fruity elf was
going to fry for sure, but he just stood there and took it without
a mark on him. He was sweating a great deal but he grinned as
if he was at a kiddie amusement park right before he launched
the biggest hoopfragging fireball I've ever seen in my life right
back. Good thing the arena was warded because the folks in
the crowd would have gotten charred to ash just like Jorge.
There weren't even any bone fragments left.
· Dorian
· Interesting. If you look at this from a mythological point of
view, this is a modern application of stealing power. For exam-
ple, Biblical legend has it that Delilah stole Samson's strength by
cutting his hair for the promise of money. In Greek myth, the
Titan Prometheus stole fire from the gods to give to humanity;
fire being a symbol of power, of course. And the ancient
Egyptians believed that stealing one's shadow, or khaibit, steals
one's magical power and/or life.
· Bullfinch
. And hey look! In each instance, bad things happened as a
result. I certainly wouldn't call being chained to a rock and hav-
ing your liver torn out every day a good thing. Coincidence? I
think not.
· Jung
e | don't know if I'd call absorbing a spell that's meant to fry you
"stealing." After all, if someone wants to fling spells at you, then
you have every right to take advantage of the mojo chan-
neled your way.
· Firelight
FILTERING
· I've heard some people accuse magicians of being unable
to cope with the modern times, but this new technique
proves the opposite. Faced with a curveball that the
Awakened world threw at us, some magicians figured out a
way to negate the side effects. I know this may set some of
you on your ears, but you can thank Saeder-Krupp and
Mitsuhama for developing this handy technique. Instead of
me doing all the explaining, though, I'm going to give Fauna,
who works with the Astral Space Preservation Society, a
chance to speak.
· Silicon Mage
by Fauna
Pollution in any form disturbs me. As a mage with some
experience under her belt, pollution of astral space is not only
disturbing but alarming. This is why I joined the Astral Space
Preservation Society that Dunkelzahn created in his will.
Many places in the Western Hemisphere-not to mention the
rest of the world-have become dangerously contaminated,
and the threat continues to grow with very little abatement
despite significant effort. In Chicago's former Containment
Zone, clouds of Strain III Beta are still a wandering menace
thanks to the steady upkeep of its background count. The
Tsimshian nation is facing massive industrial pollution from
mining, logging and chemical harvesting and refinement,
which in turn has poisoned the astral and drawn more
shamans to the toxic path. In the Yucatán, Aztlan and the
rebel groups have wrought such havoc on the land in their
war that the spirit of the land itself has rebelled. This doesn't
even include the phenomena at Crater Lake in Tir Tairngire,
the astral rift in DeeCee, Los Alamos and Trinity in the Pueblo
... the list goes on.
Even attempting to cast a spell in the midst of such a
garbage zone can be difficult, if not downright lethal. People
visiting these areas can avoid doing anything magical in nature
if need be, but the residents don't have this luxury-especially
if it helps in surviving another day. Recognizing this,
Mitsuhama's Pentacle subsidiary cooperated with The
Arcanum, a magical research company from Saeder-Krupp,
and the ASPS in finding a way to filter out the worst effects. We
believe we have been successful in the creation of a filtering
metamagical technique.
· That was less cooperation than capitulation. Pentacle, con-
ducting research on this for the problems in the Tsimshian
nation, was knee-deep in it because someone turned up evi-
dence that they stole some of The Arcanum's work. Before a big
fuss could be raised, everyone sat down and hashed out a plan
whereby everyone could benefit.
· Pistons
. But where do the ASPS enter this? I don't imagine they just
strolled into the room and said, "I say chaps, be kind and let us
have a nip."
· Bung
· Well, no. The Arcanum grandfathered them in since it used
some of the Society's people and facilities instead of theirs In
exchange for the data they came up with. When the Pentacle
deal came to the table, the ASPS sat in and raised their voices.
It's a three-way top billing on the playbill. The only problem now
is that the ASPS wants to take the results public, and both MCT
and S-K are trying to put the kibosh on that so they can make
money off of it. Thus this little article here. < display_grin>

We conducted some cautious field trials in the old
Containment Zone in Chicago first, under the guise of research-
ing the long-term effects of Strain III Beta on a magical popu-
lace. We had to resort to this subterfuge because we all agreed
that simply telling people might get their hopes up for some-
thing which may not work. Luckily it did, so we are conducting
more trials in other areas riddled with astral pollution to be
completely assured.
With this caveat in mind, I'd like to explain how the tech-
nique works in plain language. If you've ever had real orange
juice from an orange, then you know that it often gets stray bits
of pulp in it. If you're trying to drink the orange juice through a
straw, then you know how difficult it is to get any orange juice
through without the pulp clogging it up. You could simply not
drink the juice, but most magicians will tell you that this is not
an option. Magicians also can't throw the metaphorical straw
away and drink it straight-at least, not yet-so that is not an
option either. Filtering is like putting a catch guard on the
mouth of your cup or a mesh at the end of your straw; the pulp,
or the background count, is still there but you can drink more
orange juice (mana) now. We could also apply this to other
facets of our lives. We can filter our water, coffee, radio signals,
mail and trideo, so why not magic?
. You know, that makes too much sense. She can't be a college
graduate. So what's the drawback?
. Murphy
· Well it doesn't sound too easy, for one. Your filter itself may also
get clogged, to borrow Fauna's metaphor, meaning you'd have
to clean it out periodically before you can reuse it. This could
happen even quicker in places nearly as bad as the mana
warp of space. You'd probably get better or more efficient at it
as you learned more, though.
· Digitalis
. This makes me wonder. The big reason why there aren't many
mages or shamans up in space is because it is warped to such
an ungodly degree. Think it's possible that if MCT and S-K had-
n't come up with this, Ares might?
· Stella Luna
. Maybe not, but would they take advantage? I think you can
answer that.
· Nightfire
· Didn't Wuxing already have something like this in place?
· GnuB
· No, but I can see where you could get confused about it.
Wuxing's geomancers can supposedly perform other interest-
ing feats of magic that not many can understand, but they
hadn't come up with a way to filter out negative energies.
Come to think of it, I'm not entirely sure just what they can do
and no one's been too forthcoming. Think they could cleanse a
permanent, negative background count?
· Silicon Mage
· Well, it has been hinted that skilled feng shui masters can, but
when taken into account with the previous material. I honestly
don't know if that is true or not. I'm not a magician, but I am curi-
ous. I would be interested in hearing more.
· Snow Tiger
. Okay, from some posts in the past I know that feng shui is sup-
posed to mean "wind and water," but that's about it. I'd like to
hear a lot more if anyone can spare the cycles.
· Wiz Kid
· Fair enough. I'm more than curious myself as well, and I'd like
to see a modern insight into its uses, what, how and why. Let me
see what I can pull up.
· Silicon Mage
GEOMANCY
by Xiao Renwu
. That name translates into "nobody." The context here is that
he or she considers himself to be small and beneath notice,
and so is truly humble. I wonder who it is.
· Snow Tiger
Geomancy-the way I have studied it-is the art of feng
shui. I know that there are others who are also familiar with the
flow of chi, but I am not familiar with their ways so please par-
don me. Perhaps those who follow these other traditions will
annotate my words here and help provide another viewpoint.
Feng shui, to put a complex and ancient practice into
simple terms, is about living in harmony with nature and your
surrounding environment rather than against it. This includes
many factors, such as astrology (concerning the date and
time a person is born, a building planned and erected, or
when an endeavor is begun), how the land or a building is
shaped, the direction in which buildings are placed and so
on. What unites all of this, I call Tao. You may have seen ele-
ments of Tao in martial arts (like tai chi), acupuncture, divina-
tion (like I Ching), meditation and more. The energies of yang
(light, maleness, the sun, creation and warmth) and yin (dark,
femaleness, the moon, completion and cold) come from the
Tao and flow through all, further influencing the five ele-
ments, or wuxing.
. For those who weren't aware of the connection before, this is
where the Chinese megacorp Wuxing gets their name. No won-
der they've been heavy on the hoodoo.
· Ang
· Feng shui practitioners are also called wujen, just to clarify
things. Feng shui is simply more concerned with geomantic
magic, using the power of the dragon lines, than other aspects
of wujen practices.
China Doll
. This reminds me of the druids over in England and the
Aborigines down in Australia. Does this mean anyone who lives
"in harmony with nature" can manipulate manalines? If so, the
thought of a bunch of scruffy shamans having that much
potential power at their fingertips scares me silly.
· Bung
Harmony and balance may be found in the interplay of the
yin and yang. Do not confuse yin and yang with "good" and
"evil"-each type of chi is necessary. Within one lies the seed
of the other, and so the yin and yang flow in cycles, as well as
the elements. When the flow is positive, or productive, the
cycle goes like so: water nourishes wood, wood produces fire,
the ashes produce earth, and condensed earth gives metal. If
you have had a period in your life when everything seemed to
click and go well (love, prosperity, luck, good family life), then
that would be a tangible result of a positive cycle. When the
flow is negative, or destructive, the cycle goes like so: water
puts out fire, fire melts metal, metal destroys wood, wood
pierces earth, and earth absorbs water. The elements do not
merely represent themselves, but symbolize aspects of life and
society as well. The destructive cycle has dominated many
recent events like the despoiling of the Yucatán, and it is most-
ly for that reason I am sharing this information today.
. That would explain the proliferation of toxic shamans lately.
They're locked onto this "destructive cycle," to use our narrator's
term. I wonder if any of them are aware of this information.
Heck, I wonder if this means that they could be rehabilitated, so
to speak.
· Wiz Kid
e | suspect the possibility exists, but I wouldn't count on it. Some
individuals and groups like Winternight are too fragged in the
head or too stubborn to ever change.
· Digitalis
. Maybe this is also why the area around the Aztec teocalli in
Denver was so messed up. If so, then Wuxing's attempts to clean
it up would probably mean trying to put things back in bal-
ance. When Ghostwalker destroyed it ... well, that was fire at
work, right? And fire melts metal, which destroys wood, and so
on, just like this person said. So Wuxing might build things like
fountains for water and gardens for earth and wood. They're like
mystical architects.
· Libra
. Yeah, but these things take time. I wouldn't expect any instant
miracles.
· Skeptic
DIVINATION
Geomancers are also greatly concerned with the tech-
nique of divination. We do not use it so much for revelations of
the future, but mostly to clarify and understand the present.
Chinese astrology, the I Ching and dowsing are our divination
tools. Dowsing utilizes the luo pan, or a traditional compass
that is circular, wooden and set into a square board. A regular
compass can be used as well. With it, you can find water,
buried and forgotten power cables, natural materials like metal,
lost items, and most importantly, the dragon lines.
· Speaking as someone with another viewpoint, dowsing also
uses items like pendulums and various kinds of rods. The idea is
that whatever you choose to use, it should help you detect elec-
tromagnetic energy like what you would find in a manaline.
· Labrys
· Actually, what our geomancer is saying isn't about divination,
but sensing. The Australian koradji use it to navigate and avoid
the mana storms, but it would seem feng shui practitioners use
it for something else.
· Dancer
· Actually, Dancer, it's both divination and sensing. The compass
is for the latter, and astrology and I Ching are for the former. I
once worked as a bodyguard for a Wuxing exec, and he con-
sulted a feng shui master for a house he wanted to build. The
master was a very old stoop-shouldered guy, and he hobbled
around the site carrying a compass and muttering to himself.
Finally he stopped in one spot, said "Right here!" and then pro-
ceeded to tell him what direction his front door should face,
where he should put his bedroom, what shape to make the
house, you name it. As he talked, an architect the exec had
tagging along made some rough sketches of the whole thing.
The master rattled off some dates as to when it would be good
to start building-even I lost track of all the animals he men-
tioned, since Chinese astrology uses them to predict the char-
acter or personality of any given period of time. Then he squat-
ted down on the ground and started flipping coins. By the time
we left there, I think the only question left was how much this
fragger was going to pay for the services rendered.
· HK Kid
. Wait a tic. Find "natural materials like metal?" This is how
Wuxing's geomancers knew where to find orichalcum deposits?
· Skeptic
. Well, I don't know how true this is, but apparently there's some
Native American folklore that basically said you could find gold
like this. The claim is that gold could be found at "vortices,"
which I'm taking to mean manaline nexuses. So it doesn't seem
too far-fetched to me that Wuxing could find orichalcum. Let's
just hope you can't find diamonds like that, or else companies
like DeBeers-Omnitech will make more of a killing than they are
now with the diamond-turned-orichalcum mines.
· Greenhorn
· You mean power sites, and unfortunately some megacorps
have taken it into their heads to try grabbing some. They
haven't been as successful as you'd think, fortunately, thanks to
the fact that most of the major ones are under someone else's
power or protection, like T'ai Shan and Callanish.
· Oakthorn
The compass can also determine if the flow of chi, also
known as the dragon's breath, is good or bad. When it is
good, the energy is active, running like a healthy stream or
brook and circulating. When it is bad, the energy either stag-
nates or rushes out of control, like a brackish pond or a rag-
ing river, and moves in a straight line. In a natural environ-
ment, good chi can be found in places with rolling hills and
bodies of water. Bad chi accumulates in flat areas, irregularly
shaped plots of land or where the dragon's breath is blocked.
The same principles apply to an indoor environment. For
example, a straight path from the front door to the back door
of a house or business can guarantee that many things-luck,
wealth, happiness-will never stay. This can be changed with
landscaping, building other structures, mirrors, plants and
more that change the flow for good or ill. I have seen the for-
tunes of companies change in this way; creating or leveling
hills, moving a pond from its back to its front, and in the
widely-known case of Wuxing, turning all outside windows
into mirrors.
. That last one is a reminder of the feng shui war Wuxing had
not long after the Skytower was built. This sort of thing is actual-
ly more common now than most people really know. It used to
be that people were content with just improving their own for-
tunes, but now more corps like Tan Tien, Eastern Tiger, and
Shibata Construction and Engineering are taking a closer look
at feng shui to find more ways to claw at their rivals.
· HK Kid
· Dragon's breath and geomancy walking hand in
hand, Lung sitting in a big power site like T'ai Shan,
Wuxing in possession of the Jade Dragon of Wind and
Fire, and Japan just suffered a big beating during
Halley's Comet! Don't you see? The fight between
Lung and Ryumyo is almost over, and Lung is winning!
Soon Lung, who is using Wuxing (come on, Wu Lung
Wei?) to grab all the orichalcum, will make his move
and take over the world!
· Dragonslayer
· Intelligent as usual, I see. Still, the part about the Jade
Dragon of Wind and Fire reminded me of something.
Wuxing has been sitting on a power site which has only
grown more powerful thanks to the comet. They have
imprinted it, even, much like many older megalithic sites
like Stonehenge, which itself was built according to astrol-
ogy and sacred geometry and in harmony with the land. The
druids built Stonehenge, and feng shui has had a heavy hand
with the Wuxing Skytower. Stonehenge was and has been used in
ritual, religious observances, but for what greater purpose was the
Skytower built? The easy answer is "money" and increasing
Wuxing's power, but there has to be a deeper reason than that.
· Raven
· Was Stonehenge imprinted by the druids, or did the extant
power site imprint the druids? What I mean to say is that this is
an argument which has constantly made the rounds in many
academic circles. Some say the druids felt the potential power
there and built Stonehenge atop it to focus the power, and
some say the druids built it first, and then the power came,
attracted to the energy they raised. With more power sites
appearing randomly, as well as temporarily due to highly emo-
tionally charged religious ceremonies, for all anyone knows it
could be both.
· Prof. Wheel
· From what I'm given to understand, then, imprinting a power
site sort of gives you control over it, right? At least for a while,
which also explains the fight between Tsimshian and the Salish.
Not only is it getting polluted, but the Salish don't have control
over it-for now, though I suspect that's going to change if they
can help it.
· Tango
· Tango, you are making a scary amount of sense. The Aztian
teocallis, the site of the Great Ghost Dance, Uluru, toxic mana
sites ... I hope you realize I'm going to have nightmares now.
· Miss Tick
· Geomancy has never been a comfortable subject, my dear,
though it is one that I hope certain people in certain countries
are learning for the good. Like attracts like, after all.

GAME INFORMATION
Some say that there's nothing new under the sun, that
everything's been done. And then there are some who say that
anything is possible if you only believe. It would seem that
these are diametrically opposed points of view, but they aren't.
Simply stated, take what's available and put a new spin on it,
shining a light on new possibilities. The opening essay from
Silicon Mage serves to illustrate this in a way that should help
the gamemaster in creating his or her own new metamagical
techniques and give some depth to gameplay. They are not
hard and fast rules, simply guidelines for flavor.
This section provides new advanced magical rules. In
addition to SR3, gamemaster will find Magic in the Shadows
(MITS) especially useful for applying the new rules in this sec-
tion. This chapter also introduces several new metamagic abil-
ities available only to initiates (see Initiation and Metamagic, p.
57, MITS).
SYMPATHETIC MAGIC
Sympathetic magic is a general type or "flavor" of magic
that can and has been used in various pre- and post-
Awakening magical traditions. For characters who prefer the
more subtle side of magic, the various forms and methods of
sympathetic magic can be a boon. Gamemasters may also find
them useful in situations that call for trickery, investigations
(kidnapping, theft, tracking a killer) or outwitting devious
opponents on the part of player characters.
Symbolic Linking Metamagic
An initiate who learns this metamagic has the option of
using symbolic links rather than material links when it comes to
the Linking Test (p. 36-37, MITS) for ritual sorcery. Only initiates
capable of wielding Sorcery can learn this metamagic technique.
When the location of the target cannot be seen, either
physically or with astral perception, and there are no material
links available for use, a symbolic representation of the target
or an item handled by the target can be used instead. The more
closely the object is tied to the target, the better it will work.
Symbolic links are not quite as effective as material links, how-
ever, and so even a beloved childhood toy will not work as well
as having a lock of the target's hair.
Consult the Symbolic Links Table (p. 47) for the appropri-
ate modifier to use in conjunction with the Linking Test Table
(p. 37, MITS).
Symbolic Links Table Key
Favored Objects denote items-clothing, jewelry, toys,
mementos-which the target frequently wears or carries on his
person and have significant emotional value to him. A dead
lover's locket, a scrap of a childhood security blanket tucked into
a pocket and similar objects fit into this category.
Often-Handled Objects include frequently worn clothing
(a lucky shirt, a daily-worn company uniform), a familiar weapon
(a trusty Predator, a katana used since training days), a favorite
pen and other such
objects. These items tend
not to have as deep an
emotional attachment to
the target as a Favored
Object, but are used often
and have been in his or her
Condition
possession for some time.
Recently
Handled
Objects have the least
amount of attachment to a
target. A coffee cup used
at breakfast, a telephone
receiver, an office toy or a
fast-food wrapper-items
which have been in the tar-
get's possession for a min-
imum of five minutes-all fit under this category. These objects
have limited effectiveness, however; they can only be used for a
number of minutes equal to twice the target's Essence. If the rit-
ual begins before this amount of time runs out, the link remains
effective for the duration of the ritual, after which the link is gone.
If the ritual is interrupted, the link is similarly lost. Also, the object
in question may not be a Favored or Often-Handled Object for
someone other than the target; not only will the Linking Test fail
for the intended target, but the gamemaster may decide that the
ritual group inadvertently succeeds in targeting someone else!
Symbolic Representations are drawings, sculptures, dolls
and other media that resemble the target. The character creating
the representation must make a Success Test with an appropri-
ate skill (Sketching, Painting, etc.) against a target number of 4
using the modifiers from the Representation Modifiers Table. The
character must achieve at least 3 successes for the symbolic rep-
resentation to be adequate as a symbolic link. If the character
achieved only 2 successes, apply a +2 Linking Test modifier; if
the character achieved 1 success, apply a +4 modifier; if 0 suc-
cesses were achieved, the representation is unusable (which the
character will not know until the Linking Test fails).
It is not necessary for the magician using the representation
in ritual magic to be the representation's creator, although a +2
modifier is applied to the Linking Test in such a case.
Symbolic Link Foci
To make a more potent representation, such as the voodoo
dolls used by some houngans, a character may enchant the rep-
resentation into a symbolic link focus. To do this, the character
must craft the representation as above and then use Enchanting
(Artificing) skill to create a focus from it (see Artificing, p. 42,
MITS). The focus formula for a symbolic link focus has a base time
of 10 days. The Enchanting target number for symbolic link foci
is 4, and the representation counts as handmade telesma (-1
Enchanting Test modifier).
The Force of a symbolic link focus is used as modifier to the
Linking Test. No symbolic link can ever have a Force higher than
6, nor can the Force exceed the number of successes achieved
on the artistic Skill Test to create the symbolic representation.

Severing Metamagic
Severing is a
form of metamagic
that can be learned by
any initiate capable of
astral perception.
Modifier
Despite his best
intentions, a character
can become the target
of ritual sorcery or rit-
+6
ual tracking. Usually,
the best way to
-1
defend against attacks
from such is to hide in
a warded area or
under another type of
astral barrier; this can,
however, severely hamper a character's mobility while the threat
exists. The severing metamagical technique is an active defense
against ritual sorcery, allowing an initiate to break the connection
between him and the ritual team. Severing can only be used after
the ritual team has successfully completed the Targeting and
begun the Sending stage. The initiate can only sever the link if he
knows it exists (in other words, he noticed the Sending, or
someone else has alerted him). Severing metamagic only works
in cases where a ritual link rather than a spotter is used.
When the ritual link is established, the gamemaster must
keep track of how many successes the ritual team achieves on
the Linking Test. The initiate attempting to sever the ritual link
makes a Severing Test, rolling his Magic rating versus the ritu-
al leader's Magic rating +1 for every additional magician par-
ticipating in the ritual sorcery. If the severing initiate does not
know the specific nature of the material or symbolic link used
against him, he suffers an additional +2 modifier. If the sever-
ing initiate rolls more successes on the Severing Test than the
ritual team achieved on the Linking Test, the ritual link is bro-
ken. The ritual ends immediately and the ritual team must
make an immediate Drain Resistance Test. The material or sym-
bolic link they were using cannot be used for the same purpose
until another (severing initiate grade) hours have passed. If the
severing initiate rolls equal or less successes on the Severing
Test, the ritual continues unhindered.
SEVERING TEST MODIFIERS TABLE
Condition
Per magician in the ritual group other than the ritual leader
Initiate does not know the nature of the ritual link
Initiate is severing for someone or something other than self
Severing takes time equal to (10 - initiate grade) × 10 min-
utes, with every grade level including and above 10 reducing the
time by 1 minute further. The amount of time may not be
reduced to less than 1 minute. Thus a Grade 3 initiate would
need to spend 70 minutes to successfully sever the link between
himself and a ritual link, while a grade 11 initiate would need
only 8 minutes. If the initiate does not spend the full amount of
time, the link is not severed. Also, should the sending (or the
tracking) complete before the initiate is able to complete the sev-
ering, the sending wins through.
An initiate can also use severing metamagic to break ritual
links established on objects and people other than himself,
though he suffers a +2 target number modifier to the Severing
Test. The severing initiate must be able to astrally perceive the
target during the full time it takes to sever the link. If the initiate
stops perceiving astrally during the time it takes to sever the tar-
get from the ritual link, the severing fails.
It is important to note that when severing a ritual link that
was established by using a focus as the material link, the bond to
the focus itself is not broken. Rather, the ability to use the focus
as a ritual link is temporarily negated for (severing initiate grade)
hours-and the focus is also temporarily useless to the bonder
for the same amount of time. If the ritual team chooses, they may
try to use it as a ritual link again in another ritual after that time
has passed; the focus is not consumed or "used up." Characters
will not have to re-bond with foci in this circumstance.
This metamagic can be used versus a ritual link more than
once, and more than one person can attempt the severing also.
In both cases, however, each Severing Test is treated separately;
the successes are not cumulative. Count only the highest num-
ber of successes.
Ritual Magic in Reverse
Magicians are familiar with the concept of using a material
link to target someone with ritual sorcery, but in reality the mys-
tic link between the material link and whatever it came from can
be exploited from both directions. There are many ways in which
Initiated and non-initiated magicians can put this to use.
Ritual magic in reverse is an expansion upon existing
rules for ritual magic. Using a person (even himself) as a mate-
rial link in ritual sorcery, a magician can attempt to create a rit-
ual link to any tissue samples, locks of hair or other "parts" of
that person (anything that could be used as a material link
against that person, in other words). Likewise, a magician can
use a whole object as a material link to any components that
were once an integral part of that object. A magician can also
use this same process to conduct
ritual tracking "in reverse."
Only components that are still
viable as material links can be target-
Modifier
+1
ed with this reverse ritual magic. It is
more difficult to mystically track
+2
down a component of a larger thing
+2
than the reverse, so the magician or
ritual team suffers a +2 target num-
ber modifier to the Linking Test.
Additionally, the specific material link
item that is being targeted must be
known to the magician/ritual team; it is impossible to target a
potential material link item without knowing what it is.
An initiate who knows symbolic linking metamagic can per-
form reverse ritual magic against symbolic links, though the
same +2 Linking Test modifier applies as do the modifiers from
the Symbolic Links Table (p. 47).
Psychometry Metamagic
Psychometry is a metamagical technique that can be learned
by any initiate who possesses the ability to astrally perceive.
Psychometry represents the character's ability to read psy-
chic impressions left behind on an object, place or even a per-
son. Psychometry is much stronger than astral perception, allow-
ing the initiate to extract deeper impressions, feelings and even
sensory input. The more recent the impressions, the greater the
likelihood that the initiate will gain useful insight.
To use psychometry, the initiate must come into contact
with the subject (whether an item, person or place) and open his
mind to its energies. The initiate must also assense the subject
and examine the astral patterns around it.
The gamemaster rolls a number of dice equal to the initi-
ate's Aura Reading skill against a target number based on the
length of time that has passed since impressions were left (see
the Psychometry Table, p. 50). If the initiate scores any success-
es, he gains information from the psychic impressions left behind
on the subject as shown on the Psychometry Table. The
gamemaster should tailor the information to be as specific,
vague or dramatic as suits the story. The gamemaster also deter-
mines what form the psychic feedback takes (visual, auditory,
emotional, somatic, etc.). A roll of all ones results in vividly pre-
sented but completely false information.
Note that a subject may have more than one set of impres-
sions imprinted upon it (for example, a church where daily cer-
emonies occur and also where a murder occurred a week ago).
In this case, compare the results of the Aura Reading roll to the
individual target numbers for each separate impression. The ini-
tiate may gain information on more than one impression at the
same time.
The base time it takes an initiate to pick up a psychic
impression is equal to the impression's base target number (or
the highest target number in the case of multiple impression)
minus the initiate's grade in minutes. At the gamemaster's dis-
cretion, certain episodes of psychometric feedback and visions
may take longer for the initiate to experience. For the duration of
this period, maintaining the psychometry is considered an
Exclusive Complex Action, and the initiate suffers a +4 modifier

particularly potent impres-
sions may cause more
severe backlash. For exam-
ple, the gamemaster could
rule that the impression
from a ritualized torture and
murder session inflicts
Serious Stun damage on the
initiate who relives the hor-
rifying experience.
Cleansing metamagic
(p. 74, MITS) and astral sig-
nature erasure (p. 172,
SR3) can significantly
increase the difficulty of
reading psychometric
impressions, as noted on
the Psychometry Table.
An initiate can attempt
psychometry on a given
subject multiple times;
however, each subsequent
attempt imposes a +2 tar-
get number penalty to the
attempt. The initiate must
also wait a number of hours
equal to 10 minus his initi-
ate grade before making
another attempt.

action, a Willpower (6) Test is required.
If the initiate successfully picked up any impressions, he
must then roll his Willpower against a target number of 12 minus
the modified target number used for the Aura Reading Test. If the
initiate rolls no successes, he experiences psychic backlash
equivalent to a Light Stun wound. The gamemaster determines
the form this backlash takes (nausea, headache, emotional dis-
tress, etc.) A roll of all ones on this test causes a temporary pho-
gamemaster rolls her Aura Reading 5 skill and gets 2,
3, 3, 7 and 12. The gamemaster determines that the
base target number of the impression of the kidnap-
ping incident is 8 (the kidnapping occurred less than a
month ago) and that it is modified by -2 (impression of
violence), for a final Target Number 6. With her two
successes, Dorian picks up a series of quick disjointed
visions: the child being grabbed by two large dark-
haired men, the letters C and K, a flashing neon sign.

10 years or more
As the mage relays this information, the child's father
stiffens-he has a business rival named Charlie
Kellerman who owns a restaurant that might have a
neon sign.
SIGNS OF THE TIMES
Magician culture, like other cultures, has varied interests
and subgroups with different agendas. While some are content
to live their lives unconcerned with anything but what they see
day to day, others are reaching for more. Whether in the streets,
corporate boardrooms or some elite magic society's warded
rooms, magicians employ duels arcane to resolve power strug-
gjes, test their strength or teach lessons. Other magicians are
more concerned about the ecology of the astral and its impact
upon hermetics, shamans and others. New metamagics have
artsen from these as a result.
Magic Duels
Dueling, in both a historical and fictional perspective, is an
idea that has refused to fade away, even in the world of
Shadowrun. Its association with antiquarian, gentlemanly ideals
contrasts sharply with Shadowrun and its near-futuristic atmos-
phere, providing the basis for magic dueling's allure. Replacing
fencing foils, rapiers and sabers with spells and foci, skill and cun-
ning remain the focus of this potentially deadly sport. Whether
wiz kid gangers vying for supremacy over their gang, a fight to
"first blood" to satisfy a corporate mage's quest for legitimacy
from a colleague or a mage teaching a student a lesson, dueling
is an underground phenomenon slowly gaining popularity
among magicians across the power spectrum.
In general, magic duels involve two magicians who are pit-
ting their power against each other. They may or may not put
certain conditions on the duel such as the ones mentioned in the
fiction, depending on the type of duel, the situation at hand, and
so forth. There are two types of duels: supremacy duels and sor-
cerous duels.
Supremacy Duels
A supremacy duel (also known as "scorching") works much
the same as a banishing contest (p. 189, SR3), except that the
contest is against a magician instead of a spirit. This is the most
direct way of proving one's power against another mage or
shaman, as a magician can potentially permanently burn out his
own or his opponent's magic ability in the process, which is what
the slang term "scorching" refers to.
This type of duel consists of a Success Contest, where each
participant rolls his or her Sorcery skill with his or her opponent's
Magic rating as the target number. Spell Pool may not be used,
but power foci may be allowed (but only to increase the charac-
ter's Magic rating, not providing extra dice) if both parties agree.
Each net success reduces the opponent's Magic attribute by 1,
until either the duel is called to an end (either by the winner or a
third party appointed to referee) or the opponent's Magic is
reduced to 0. If a character's Magic reaches 0, his aura is
momentarily disrupted and he passes out, taking Deadly Stun
damage, much like astral combat (p.176, SR3). He must after-
ward check for permanent Magic loss (p.160, SR3), but other-
wise his Magic rating will return or "refresh" at a rate of one
point per hour. Supremacy dueling is an Exclusive Complex
action between two magicians only.
Sorcerous Duels
Sorcerous duels are simpler affairs involving mainly spell-
casting, though there are rumors that some magicians will also
use spirits as well as or even instead of themselves, making it into
little more than spirit cockfighting. These can happen at any time
or place, even in the astral, and can involve more than two magi-
cians. They may use any type of foci, metamagical techniques or
any other magical ability available to the magicians in question.
This is particularly where formalized rules enter play, usually to
protect bystanders: a warded area for the duelists, a third party
mediator, seconds to act as proxies or witnesses, and so on.
Absorption Metamagic
Absorption metamagic can be learned by any initiate capa-
ble of using the Sorcery skill.
The absorption metamagic technique allows an initiate to
absorb spells cast at herself or even at other characters.
Absorption is similar to shielding and reflecting metamagics (pp.
78-79, MITS) in that it uses spell defense (p. 183, SR3). But
whereas reflecting redirects the spells back to their caster, or
shielding simply prevents the spell from reaching or affecting the
target, absorbing allows the initiate to take in the mana energy
fueling the spell.
When using the absorbing technique, the defender allo-
cates Sorcery and Spell Pool dice to absorbing with the same
limitations as spell defense. When a character protected by
absorption dice is targeted by a spell, the initiate can choose to
use absorption dice against that spell. Each success from
absorption dice on the Spell Resistance Test removes one of
the attacker's successes normally and puts one die into a tem-
porary Absorption Pool. If a spell is reduced to 0 successes, it
fails to affect that target. Against area spells, absorption dice
will only protect those characters who have absorption dice
allocated to protect them. Other characters will be affected
normally, even if the spell is absorbed (because only part of the
spell's energies are absorbed). Area elemental manipulations
are an exception; if any target of such a spell successfully
absorbs it, the entire spell is absorbed (a stunning visual effect)
and will not affect any others.
Absorption Pool dice can be used much like Spell Pool dice;
for all intents and purposes, the pool acts as a second Spell Pool.
This allows the character to use this pool in addition to her nor-
mal Sorcery and Spell Pool dice.
An initiate cannot have an Absorption Pool greater than
twice her Magic rating. Absorbing raw mana is also a draining
experience. At the end of any Combat Phase in which an initiate
has absorbed a spell, that initiate must make a Drain Resistance
Test with a Damage Code of M and a Power equal to the num-
ber of dice currently in her Absorption Pool. If the Power exceeds
the initiate's Magic attribute, the Drain is Physical damage rather
than Stun.
Maintaining an Absorption Pool is similar to sustaining a
spell. The initiate suffers a +2 modifier and cannot perform
Exclusive actions. If the initiate takes damage, she must make a
Sorcery Test against the number of dice in the Absorption Pool
(plus any injury modifiers) to maintain concentration; if she fails,
the pool dice are lost.
An initiate can only hold on to this absorbed energy for a
number of Combat Turns equal to her initiate grade. After this
time, the initiate automatically suffers one box of Stun damage
(or Physical damage if the pool dice exceed her Magic rating) at
the end of each Combat Turn during which she continues to
maintain the pool. An initiate may release the absorbed dice at
any time (or a portion of them) with a Free Action; these ener-
gies dissipate harmlessly into the ether.
Dre has allocated 6 absorption dice to protect his
two teammates, Maga and Tony Two-Chins. Moments
later, they are both targeted with a Force 4 Serious dam-
age manaball, which achieves 1 success on Maga and 3
on Tony. Dre rolls the 3 absorption dice protecting
Maga and gets 1, 4 and 5, so the 1 success against her
is absorbed. He also rolls the 3 absorption dice protect-
ing Tony and gets 1, 2 and 6, so only 1 success against
him is absorbed. Dre has absorbed 2 dice into his
Absorption Pool, and Maga is completely unaffected by
the manaball. Tony, however, still faces Deadly damage.
Dre already has 4 dice in his Absorption Pool, so
at the end of that Combat Phase he must resist 6M Stun
(his Magic rating is 6) for absorbing more mana. His ini-
tiate grade is 1, and he has already been maintaining
the pool for 1 Combat Turn, so Dre will take an auto-
matic box of Stun damage at the end of the Combat
Turn if he doesn't use that energy soon.
Filtering Metamagic
Filtering is a metamagical technique that can be learned by
an initiate that knows cleansing metamagic (p. 74, MITS).
Cleansing metamagic can clear up temporary background
count and allow a character to cast spells without that penalty,
but as yet there is no way to clear up a permanent background
count (pp. 83-86, MITS). This is where the filtering metamagic
technique can help instead; filtering does not cleanse, but con-
structs a temporary "matrix" that allows the initiate to access
"clean" mana despite mana static and warping. Much like pan-
ning for gold, filtering can sort through the dross that is the
background count and get to the useful mana, reducing or
negating all the penalties imposed. This metamagical tech-
nique can be used for both temporary and permanent back-
ground counts, and can even apply towards aspected power
sites and mana warps (pp. 84-86, MITS).
To use the filtering metamagic, an initiate must attune her-
self to the area and create a "filter" for her magic; the initiate
takes an exclusive Complex Action and makes a Magic Test
against a target number equal to the background count. Every 2
successes temporarily reduce the effective background count
against the initiate by 1. This will remain in effect for a number of
Combat Turns equaling initiate grade x (10- background count),
after which the filter becomes "clogged" and the initiate must fil-
ter again in order to continue to benefit.
Note that filtering only temporarily reduces the effects of
the background count for the initiate using these techniques; the
background count remains at the same level, along with penal-
ties, for everyone else in that area.
Zhan is trekking through an irradiated hellhole (a
mana warp with a background count of 6) when he is
attacked by a swarm of mutant critters. Wanting to use
magic with as little obstruction as possible, he attunes
himself to the area, rolling his Magic attribute of 9
against the Background Count 6, getting only 1 suc-
cess. He blows Karma for a re-roll, gets lucky, and rolls
3 more successes. His 4 successes allow him to tem-
porarily reduce the effective background count against
him by 2 (4 + 2), to a Background Count 4. This means
he will only suffer a +4 modifier rather than +6, and he
will not suffer the Magic reduction, increased Drain or
astral damage normally associated with the mana
warp. Zhan is a Grade 3 initiate, so this filter he has cre-
ated for his magic will only last for 12 Combat Turns
([10-6] x 3).
GEOMANCY
Though it has been at least fifty years since the Awakening,
old lore and traditions previously thought of as "quaint," "crack-
pot" or simply forgotten surface more and more often. They
bring with them their own unique perspectives, knowledge and
arcane practices. Geomancy, though practiced for thousands of
years, has been one of the most enigmatic of these, operating
quietly and in plain sight but just under the radar in the post-
Awakening magical community. References to it have been
made now and then in the world of Shadowrun, and yet not
many seem to know anything about it beyond its ties to the path
of wuxing (p.17, MITS) through feng shui. Whether this is a
cover-up, deliberately keeping people from the truth, or simply
a sin of omission, is something the gamemaster may decide for
his or her game. At this point, no one really knows and not many
are forthcoming since many geomancers work for corporations
like Wuxing, who would not be pleased to see "company
secrets" made public, or belong to secretive societies, like the
Druids in England.
Geomancy deals with manalines (also called in some tradi-
tions song lines, ley lines or dragon lines), power sites and other
fixtures of astral topography. More information on them can be
found in Magic in the Shadows (pp. 84-85) and Target:
Awakened Lands (pp. 99-100). Additionally, geomancers are
particularly familiar with the sensing (p. 110, T:AL), cleansing and
divination (p. 74, MITS) metamagical techniques, among others.
Imprinting
As a general rule, any magical group that controls a man-
aline or power site for a period of at least one lunar month (28
days) can temporarily imprint their own aspect to the mana in
that area. Some groups may wish to imprint a site for a lengthy
period, perhaps permanently. Maintaining control over a site
requires prolonged ritual and mundane use, which favors the
group. In the context of geomancy, a druidic ritual group would
hold a monthly, highly charged meeting supplemented with the
seasonal religious observances (the Equinoxes and the Solstices).
Likewise, a toxic group might systematically pollute the sur-
rounding environment, summon toxic spirits and cast spells such
as Acid Stream or Toxic Wave in some bizarre rites.
As a general guideline, if a ritual group uses a manaline
or power site on a regular basis for a minimum of eight, usu-
ally more, times a year, that site will remain aspected towards
that group for at least one year. If a ritual group remains unop-
posed in their use of that site, over time (with a minimum of
five years but usually more) the imprinting may become per-
manent. The cleansing metamagic technique may be used to
combat this permanency, if the background count has not
become permanent.
Dowsing (Intelligence)
Dowsing is a Knowledge skill that is sometimes used much
as the prediction skill needed in the divination metamagic (p. 74,
MITS); in geomancy, however, it is a Complementary skill to the
Sensing Test for the Sensing metamagic technique (p. 110,
T:AL). See the rules for Complementary skills on p. 97, SR3.
Default: Intelligence
Specializations: Compass (western or Chinese luo pan),
Pendulum, L-rod, Y-rod, Bobber
A geomancer may use any tool (listed above in the special-
izations), but some are specific to certain traditions, such as the
luo pan for feng shui. Y-rods and L-rods are generally sticks, usu-
ally of wood but sometimes metal or wire, in a Y or L shape.
Bobbers resemble something akin to fishing rods, made out of a
flexible wood or metal rod with a weighted string affixed to the
end. The geomancer walks over the ground he or she is dowsing
with the chosen implement in either one or both hands, depend-
ing on the chosen tool, as he or she is using the sensing metam-
agic. The geomancer will typically have an individual system
whereby the behavior of the tool is interpreted. The more skill the
geomancer has in dowsing, the better he or she may interpret the
nuances of his or her chosen dowsing implement's behavior.
Astrology (Intelligence)
The astrology skill has been covered in general in Magic in
the Shadows (p. 74).
Default: Intelligence
Specializations: Chinese, Mayan, Native American, Vedic,
Western
Geomancers make extensive use of the divination metam-
agic as well as sensing. Those who practice feng shui, however,
use Chinese, or Oriental, astrology and not the western system.
Where the western system is solar-based, the Chinese system is
based on the lunar. The Chinese have 12 animals (Rat, Ox, Tiger,
Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Ram, Monkey, Rooster, Dog and
Pig), and these color, or give personality, to a given year. The five
elements and the qualities of yin or yang further define a given
person's birth date (or date in which a new project is started or a
building is begun or finished) to the month, day and hour. The
Chinese New Year begins in late January or early February, and so
someone born just prior to that is regarded as falling under the
animal sign of the previous year.
Whoever said, "The more things change, the more things stay the same," obviously has-
n't been around the past few years. First the UCAS deploys troops to Seattle after the
Renraku arcology lockdown. Then came Salto, the Pueblo annexing LA, and a three-
way Mexican standoff in the Mojave. Then the Salish and Tsimshian decide to let personal
feuds heat up into a border war. Now it seems like we're only one international incident
away from a full-scale shooting war that could rage the entire Pacific coast from San Diego
to Kitimat.
With this in mind, I thought it would be a good idea to update the earlier Fields of Fire
download, since it was about seven years obsolete. I sent a request to our resident gun-for-hire,
Matador, for the latest buzz in the merc world. I got a rude shock when a reply came months
later from Picador, Matador's second-in-command. Turns out Matador finally bought it during
a patrol of the Salish-Tsimshian border when a sniper put a bullet through Matador's head.
Still, Picador was gracious enough to fill in for her former boss. So keep the newble hazing
to a minimum and listen to what Picador has to say; otherwise you could end up like Matador.

Transmitted: 05 January 2063 at 09:36:31 (PST)
Hola, comrades in the shadows. I am Picador, and I come at the request of Captain Chaos
bringing news of the latest word in the circles of mercenaries and other soldiers of fortune.
Some of you were perhaps expecting Matador, a regular visitor to your digital world, to be
sharing this information with you.
I regret to inform you that Matador, Colonel Juan Samuel Pererya, my commanding offi-
cer, is no more.
On our most recent contract, we were performing border patrolling for the Salish along
the Chilicotin River. We were about to halt for the night when several high-pitched whistles
shattered the twilight's tranquility. Matador barked out orders for us to disperse, but that
proved to be his undoing. I had just turned to look at him when the telltale crack of a sniper's
rifle rang out above the din of the artillery barrage. Next thing I knew, blood sprayed over my
face as a large-caliber round vaporized Matador's head. It is a sight that will haunt me for the
rest of my life.
. Damn, Carmen, I'm sorry to hear that. I knew Sam long
before you signed on with him. He was one of the few class
acts in the league.
· Arctic White
. I'm sorry to hear about Matador, too. But I have to add that I
don't think Matador was just a random casualty of war. It's
nothing I can put in words-call it a gut feeling from more than
20 years of soldiering. But if I were you, Picador, I'd suggest
watching your back: someone was gunning after Matador, and
they may come after you next.
· Colonel Cobra
. Gracias for the warning, mi amigo. I have my suspicions. I'll get
in touch with you later at the Outpost.
· Picador
Nevertheless, Shadowland must have meant something to
him; ever since that upload he sent from Peru seven years ago
he'd been a regular visitor here. On several occasions, infor-
mation obtained here saved our hoops, but there were also
times where some idiot shadowrunner tagalong nearly got all
of us killed by his own stupidity. So in addition to a glimpse of
what changes the world has wrought the merc world, I also
offer a basic primer on our stock in trade. Pay attention, and
maybe next time you'll save us all a lot of trouble.
GUNS FOR HIRE
To understand what it is to be a merc, first you have to
understand that a merc is different from a shadowrunner.
"How?" you may ask. After all, at first glance it seems we both
perform similar functions: we both perform dirty work for hire.
Sometimes we even resort to violence.
· Hah! And there we see the difference already. On a run, if you
pull a gun, the job's hosed.
· Jaxon
. That's not always the case, you elitist bastard. Sometimes the
only way you can succeed at a shadowrun is where you have
to make noise.
· Wedge
. And if you're implying that mercs only make noise, Jaxon, well
you obviously don't know a damn thing about merc work. When
you're on a LRRP (long range recon patrol, for you civvies) fifty
klicks inside enemy lines, noise is the last thing you want.
· Flak Jack
But what really sets mercs apart from shadowrunners is
where we work. Both in the geographical and metaphorical
sense. Those of you who run the shadows live and work in the
Sprawl, in the confines of ordered society. True, many of you
live and work in the cracks of society, but it is the Sprawl that
creates those cracks, raising the walls that cast the shadows in
which you thrive.
But while the Sprawl is the runner's domain, mercs thrive
in the Wilderness. The ordered society that frames your world
does not exist out on the battlefield. Shadowrunners may live
and die on legwork and meeting contacts, but mercenaries
often go for days on end without seeing another soul. We learn
to be self-sufficient, to live off the land and whatever we carry
in our rucksacks. Shadowrunners worry about Lone Star, Knight
Errant and other law enforcement agencies, but out here in the
field the only law enforcement to worry about is the law of the
jungle, where only the strong and smart survive.
· Sheesh, what is this slag, a mercenary poet?
· Sandeep
· Never met Picador, have you? Before she hooked up with
Matador's outfit, she used to be a literature student in Madrid.
Takes all kinds, I guess.
· Hangfire
MISSION ESSENTIALS
I had reviewed Matador's earlier Fields of Fire from seven
years ago to see if there was anything for me to build upon, but
it seems he spent most of the time ranting endlessly about
honor, professionalism and discipline. Understandable in its
own way, because it was the stupidity of the shadowrunners
we worked with that got us all nearly killed; were it not for
them, Matador wouldn't have been in the hospital for eight
months writing that little diatribe of his. Unfortunately, he left
little in the way of practical, useful information applicable in the
field. Honor means very little when one is trying to clear a
minefield, after all.
The first thing you should understand is that the type of
work that we mercs commonly perform isn't the same as the
kind of work you shadowrunners pull off. You rarely find us
pulling a corporate extraction in the middle of the sprawl, after
all. And the tasks and missions we perform call for different
tactical approaches and battle drills than what you in the shad-
ows may be used to.
Remote Security
Ever since extraterritoriality gave corporations the right to
arm themselves, the merc's bread and butter has been provid-
ing security for facilities, compounds and other corporate build-
ings in remote out-of-the-way places. The plain truth is that the
megacorps simply have too many places to guard and not
enough guards to watch them all. So they turn to us to pick up
the slack.
· Not enough guards? Three companies of Jaguars watching
Aztechnology's Seattle pyramid aren't enough guards? Sheesh,
I'm glad I didn't run into them when they were at full strength!
· Trixie
· It's called economy of force. While the Azzies were reinforcing
the barricades to keep out your skinny hoop, they were deplet-
ing garrisons in Tijuana, San Antonio and who knows how many
other facilities around the world.
· Arclight
Most corps like to keep their house units in high-visibility
public places in the big cities, so often the places we're asked
to protect are way out in the boondocks, especially in hot
areas where there's a brushfire war or guerilla insurgency tak-
ing place. Places like Siberia, Africa, South America or even
upper Saskatchewan. It's not uncommon to be dropped off at
a lab or mine out in the middle of nowhere, with the nearest
sign of civilization at least a few hours away by air. Since help
could be at least a day or more in coming, the important thing
here is to know how to be self-sufficient and tough it through
the worst situations.
If you're contracted to protect a remote facility, the oppo-
sition forces (or OPFOR, as they're sometimes called) come in
many varieties. Raids by shadowrunners or other mercs are
always a risk, but they only occur intermittently. More likely,
the type of enemy you'll see are guerillas, partisan forces or
paramilitary militias. Usually these forces are small and possess
inferior weapons, but the real problem is that they snipe at you
constantly from under cover with a lot of harassing fire and hit-
and-fade tactics. The important thing to remember is not to
break under all that harassment. Guerillas have an uncanny
sense of knowing when you've broken, and when that hap-
pens, they bum-rush you.
The other thing you can do is take the fight back to the
guerillas. Whenever we got one of these babysitting contracts,
we rarely spent the whole time hunkered down under cover.
Matador hated sitting still, so he sent patrols out into the sur-
rounding woods to flush out and light up the guerillas. That
way he sent the message who was the boss in the area, and we
hardly got any trouble afterwards.
· Picador forgot to mention about one other type of opposi-
tion: the non-metahuman kind. Ever since the Awakening it's
been a lot less safe to go into the woods, what with the wild
metacritters lurking out there. Sometimes the critters can be a
lot more frightening than the guerillas; I once took a contract
with Mitsuhama to protect one of their research labs in
Macedonia a few years ago, while the Balkan warlords were
having one of their usual spats. Recent shelling around Tetovo
had displaced some of the local wildlife, and a pack of those
three-headed Cerberus wolves decided to migrate south and
mark their new hunting grounds right where our lab was locat-
ed. I lost three buddies to the wolves before we were able to
exterminate them. Even now I still get the creeps when I hear a
wolf howl, even if it's only on the trid.
· Dio
. Sometimes on these remote security jobs, you're not hired
to keep intruders out, but to keep something in: for example,
prison work camps, POWs, paranimal holding pens, even
some corporate R&D labs in which work assignments are less
than "voluntary."
Depending on the type of inmates and your employer, the
rules of engagement can vary from camp to camp. Sometimes
your employer may forbid deadly force unless absolutely nec-
essary (for example, even recalcitrant corp chromedomes are
still expensive to replace). In other cases, your employer may
prefer you to shoot first and not ask questions later.
Oh, and just because you were hired to keep something in,
that doesn't mean you don't have to worry about outside intrud-
ers. As a matter of fact, simply because you're keeping someone
or something in (probably against their will), it's more likely that
someone from outside is going to come to spring them.
· Bishop Frost
Patrolling
Patrolling is similar to remote security, but on a bigger
scale. Instead of a single site, you're asked to protect a stretch
of land. It may be a district that's having problems with gueril-
las. Or it may be the border between two hostile nations. The
list of possibilities is endless.
· Or it may be important routes, like highways, railways and sup-
ply lines. Between Awakened critters and the general
Balkanization of the world order, a lot of routes have become
more vulnerable to attack. Heck, just recently the Pueblo have
been hiring mercs to patrol 1-10 between Palm Springs and the
Palo Verdes because of their brushfire war with the Anasazi and
other Mojave bandits.
· Punkrabbit
The rules of remote security also apply here; after all, if you
think about it, you're providing remote security on a larger
scale. Most contracts usually engage company or even battal-
ion-sized units, because of the size of the area being covered.
· Back in the day, when there used to be superpowers and the
United Nations actually meant something, a lot of patrolling
contracts would have been considered peacekeeping mis-
sions. Sometimes you're being asked by a local warlord or
banana republic to keep the populace quiet while their forces
are off fighting elsewhere. If that sounds like something you're
doing, a word of warning: if the warlord is asking you to keep the
peace, it means he's having trouble paying his own people to
do so. So what's to guarantee he'll be able to pay you? Caveat
emptor, and ask for some advance pay before you sign.
· Dancin' Hanson
If you find yourself working one of these contracts, I rec-
ommend treating the locals well and hiring a guide. Guides
know the lay of the land well, and they can show and tell you
things you wouldn't discern by reading a map alone. Like the
fact that the Barghazi Pass was mined during a battle four years
ago and still hasn't been fully cleared. Or that the Strietswald
Forest is home to wild packs of fenrir wolves who hunt at night.
Or that while the residents of Pak Tat may show their loyalty to
the warlord of Lanzhou, they really hate him and are secretly
aiding the warlord's enemies. Guides are worth their weight in
orichalcum, and you will only get a good, trustworthy one if
you earn the locals' respect.
Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance simply means scouting out a certain area
of ground to get some information. Sometimes you're just try-
ing to get a feel for the lay of the land, looking for key terrain
to take and defend, potential ambush sites, and lots of other
things you can't tell by looking at a map. Most of the time
you're tracking an enemy force, trying to determine which
units are there, what they're doing, how they're operating, any
habits and tendencies they favor and so on.
Reconnaissance missions vary in scope and duration, but
the types of missions we mercs get generally involve covering a
large region (a dozen square kilometers or more) for weeks or
even months, usually behind enemy lines. On these types of
missions, what you take along becomes critically important as
your opportunities to stock up on equipment and supplies come
few and far between. It's not so bad if your unit is mechanized or
motorized; at least your vehicles are the ones humping the load.
But if you're a foot-infantry grunt, better learn to live off the land,
because that rucksack gets really heavy really fast.
· For several years the Texas Rangers have been contracting
mercs to perform long-range recon patrols in the Aztlan-occu-
pied parts of Texas, and even a few kilometers southward
beyond the Rio Grande. All we were supposed to do was sim-
ply watch: which Azzie units moved in, their strength and train-
ing, who were the various unit commanders, strengths and
weaknesses and peculiar habits, et fragging cetera. That way, if
the boys at Fort Hood ever got the word to roll, they'd have the
intelligence edge over the Azzies.
· Riggs
· One interesting trend, especially among North American
mercs, is that mercs specializing in recon ops have been turning
to mounted recon-not on vehicles, but on horses! Horses can
carry more than your regular grunt, they travel farther and faster
in a day, and they don't have the heat, noise and radar signa-
ture of combat vehicles. One unit, the Desert Rangers, has even
gone so far as to develop reinforced saddle pintles, so they can
fire their heavy and automatic weapons while in the saddle.
· Flint
The one important thing to remember about recon mis-
sions is to keep quiet. The longer the enemy doesn't know
you're there, the easier it is to shadow them. And on the other
side of the coin, once they find out about you they'll change all
their plans, so those weeks spent out in the cold and rain
meant nothing.
Raids
If there's anything that mercs do that most resembles
shadowrunning, raids are probably it. Break into somewhere,
do something, then break out again. Pretty simple, no matter
how you cut it.
Well, that's where the similarities end. From what I have
seen from shadowrunners, shadowrunners favor stealthy tactics
when on a raid; sneak in, grab what they came for, and (hope-
fully) sneak out again. Shadowrunners prefer to beat defenses by
not alerting them to their presence. Their favorite tools and
weapons include silencers, invisibility spells and sleaze utilities.
With mercs, our tactics are different. Most of the targets
we hit are out in the wilderness, with backup forces at least
several hours' travel away. So instead of stealth, we go for sur-
prise and shock. Hit them hard, hit them fast, do our job and
beat feet before they can recover their wits.
. And when Picador says hit hard and hit fast, she does not
mean maximize the body count. What she means is to pound
them relentlessly, so as to break their wills. When the whole
world is blowing up around you, it's very hard not to turn tail
and flee. To put it in other terms, think of this as intimidation by
superior firepower.
· Roadblock
· Like a lot of shadowruns, some merc raids take place to grab
something that the other side wants. But that's not always the
case. The objective of a merc raid maybe to take out someone
or something: a fuel dump, an ammo transfer point, a certain
general and his command staff and so on.
· Scrap Iron
· And sometimes it's just to get a message across. A few years
ago, my unit was hired to raid a series of poppy farms near
Mandalay in Myanmar. Our orders were to leave all the facilities
and personnel intact (as much as possible), but to torch every
poppy and all the heroin derived from it. Turns out all those
poppy farms were owned by a warlord in the Myanmar interior
threatening to go to war with his neighboring warlord down-
stream on the Irrawaddy. The message was pretty clear: you
attack me, and I cut off your cash flow. The two made peace
pretty quickly.
· Duy uy Minh
Show of Force
A show of force is a diversionary mission. Rather than an
attack to seize an objective, a show of force accomplishes no
other purpose than to attract the enemy's attention to yourself.
The only reason to do so is to distract them, usually from an
assault or infiltration taking place somewhere else.
These types of job aren't very popular in merc circles. True,
deception and distraction is an essential part of tactics, but you
risk heavy casualties for no real purpose. Matador always
charged more for a show of force mission than a regular raid.
. | once took a contract to light up a UniOil facility near Seattle
almost ten years ago, while a shadowrunner team snuck into
another facility. I ended up losing more than two-thirds my com-
pany, including my best first sergeant, Johnny Roman Nose.
Anyone asks me to pull off a job like that again, I'm telling them
to take a dive into Puget Sound.

Desert Wars
It would be inconceivable to discuss mercenaries without
a mention about Desert Wars. After all, most of you wouldn't
even know about us if it wasn't for this little media spectacle.
I'm sure you've heard the story of how it began: back in the
day, two corp teams went to war in the Libyan Desert over some
tech prize. Each called in back-up, and before long a major bat-
tle was brewing. A media team got wind of the conflict, man-
aged to insert a trid crew into the middle and hit bonanza with
the ratings. The rest, as the saying goes, is history.
Since then, both the corps and the networks have been
paying mucho dinero for us mercs to fight each other or the
corporate armies in the North African wastelands. The prize
purses can score some big money and offer tempting incen-
tives for units just starting out. Especially tantalizing is the
Mercenary Challenge, which offers a prize purse in the millions
for the best two and further bonuses for taking on the mega-
corps' best teams.
In fact, the Desert Wars have gotten so popular that the
networks are spinning off two new Desert Wars series. The first
one will take place in the Gobi Desert, with the central broad-
casting headquarters located around Baotou, Inner Mongolia.
CBC and ABS are producing the series, which is set to air this
fall. From what I've heard, the networks have already put out
calls for units, and a few North African veterans are supposed-
ly on the ground there already.
. They're going to be in for a shock, then. Fighting in the Gobi
is nothing like the Libyan wastes. Out in North Africa, there's
nothing but sand as far as the eye can see, which makes it
prime tank country. The Gobi, however, is rocky terrain, and
that portion near Baotou has quite a few highlands and
mountains. This kind of terrain favors t-birds and helicopter-
borne air assault. If you get a gig out there, make sure you've
got some good air defense vehicles, like the Ruhrmetall
Falkener or Vogelhund.
· Reaper
. While the Gobi may be rockier and more uneven than North
Africa, it's not exactly Rocky Mountain T-bird country either. Me
and my wingman Szechuan were playing t-bird tag with some
mercs contracted to Shiawase. Szechuan went in to make a
bombing run on a few APCs in a low canyon. At the end of the
canyon Szechuan pulled up too early; just as he had cleared
the canyon walls, a laser from an overwatching Keilor assault
tank nailed him in the underside. The bastard scored a lucky hit
and hit one of Szechuan's interior rocket pods, cooking off the
rockets in there and blowing his T-bird apart.
· Hipot
. I think there's more to these Gobi Wars than just ratings. Some
folks I know in Manhattan tell me that CBC is the lead produc-
er, and Mitsuhama owns CBC. Mitsuhama, which runs several
mines in the Russian Far East, is pretty ticked at Yamatetsu, who
had just beat them out in securing some exclusive mineral rights
around the Gobi. Sounds like the Gobi Wars are just a screen for
some MCT sniping at Yamatetsu.
· Datura
· There's a hidden agenda, but it's not Mitsuhama's. Though
CBC is the lead producer, the original concept came from ABS,
who got CBC to front the costs in the partnership. From what
media wags have told me, Gobi Wars came on ABS's drawing
boards in late February-soon after the great dragon Lung
laired up on T'ai Shan in Shandong. And if you check the books,
you'll find that ABS is owned by ... Saeder-Krupp! Methinks per-
haps Lofwyr may be using the Gobi Wars to screen some sort of
power play against Lung.
· Black Knight
The second spinoff is set to broadcast somewhere a little
closer to all of you in Shadowland-as a matter of fact, practi-
cally in your backyard. EEX, an entertainment studio out of Los
Angeles, will be broadcasting some of the running battles tak-
ing place in the Mojave Desert between mercs, the Pueblo
security forces, desert marauders and some of the wilder beasts
living in the desert there. From some of the talk I've heard from
mercs out around Barstow, the Mojave Wars are being billed as
a "reality show," and aiming for grit and edge, as opposed to
the glitter and hype normally found in North Africa.
. And who owns EEX? Amalgamated Studios, which was
recently bought out by ... the Pueblo! Considering how much
trouble they've been having in securing the Mojave, it looks like
the Pueblo are trying to make the best out of a bad situation.
· Studio Tech
Safari
Safari-the hunt for big game. Every now and then there
comes up a call in the merc community for a job to go out into
deepest darkest Nowheresland to find and capture some
undiscovered species of Awakened metacritter (usually dan-
gerous). Alternately, the call comes up to exterminate a pack
of wild somethings that's been threatening a remote facility.
Either way, it's work for us.
More often than not, light foot-infantry units get these
missions over mechanized units; all the heat and noise vehicles
put out usually scares off the local wildlife. If you ever get one
of these jobs, I'd recommend getting a lot of high-powered
weapons. I don't recommend using any sort of anti-vehicle or
indirect fire weapons; most of these have a minimum arming
range, and critters, from my experience, have a nasty knack of
getting in way too close for comfort.
· If you ever get one of these safari or bughunting jobs, I'd real-
ly recommend taking along a few flamethrowers. For a long
time these things were considered tactically obsolete, because
the short range couldn't keep up with modern heavy
weapons. But metacritters don't play by conventional tactics,
and fear of fire seems to be a very common primal trait. It's no
surprise that flamethrowers made their comeback after the
Awakening and the appearance of all these metacritters.
· Recondo
· Just because paracritters don't observe the rules of warfare
doesn't mean they're dumb, either. You still need to use smart
tactics, or you may find yourselves being the prey instead. Our
platoon had been hired out to hunt down a pack of rabid
agropelters (you know, those psycho goblinized lab monkeys)
that had been terrorizing several Salish-Shidhe tribes in the east-
ern Council lands. Reading through after-action reports of Salish
Rangers who tried hunting them down earlier, we could tell that
brute force simply wasn't going to work; they simply scattered,
regrouped and counter-ambushed the Rangers when their
guard was down.
So what we did was split into two groups: flushers and trap-
pers. The trappers set up an ambush area, using the local
woods and plants to set up some Malayan tiger traps, pits, vine
nets, even some collapsing trees if they came from above.
(Agropelters have a wickedly good sense of smell, so we could-
n't use anything artificial.) Meanwhile we flushers combed
through the woods making lots of noise and letting off all sorts
of stink bombs, which drew out the agropelters to attack. When
they did, we fell back to the ambush area, and the agropelters
rushed in, setting off the traps, which caught them and held
them in place. With the agropelters pinned down and unable
to move, we had no trouble wiping them out.

THE ART OF WAR
Because the jobs we perform have different objectives,
time frames and big-picture scopes than what you in the shad-
ows may be used to, we approach our biz in a different man-
ner. Here's what you need to know if you want to work in our
world.
The Contract
For most shadowrunning jobs, your team is hired to per-
form one specific mission. You get the job, spend a few days
on legwork, and then make the run. After the run, you hook up
with your client, review the results or hand over the goods, get
paid and walk away. End of shadowrun.
It isn't like that in the merc world. While the shadowrun-
ner's world may revolve around a single job, ours revolves
around the contract. Sometimes the contract calls for our ser-
vices for a single mission, but in most cases the terms specify
a tour of duty for a given duration of time, like a month, three
months, six months or whatever. During that timeframe, we
may engage on several missions, battles, or engagements, all
the while serving under the same contract.
· Which makes employer trust all the more serious in our line of
work. When you're working for the same "Johnson" for months
at a time, you get to know their subtleties and quirks-and they
yours. Such intimate knowledge makes betrayal even more
painful. And considering how close-knitted mercs are, word
travels fast. So if you do pull a double-cross around mercs, you
may as well put a machine gun to your head, because some
other merc certainly will.
· Hangfire
Chain of Command
Just about all the mercs I've known used to come from
some military background, and they still maintain the old mili-
tary organizations and command structures. And with good
reason, too. There are no lone wolves in the merc community.
When you are out in the field with no other contact other than
the enemy, you learn to work together with your teammates.
With that in mind, I thought I'd give a quick primer on
basic military unit structures. Keep in mind that different coun-
tries (and even different merc units!) may have slightly differ-
ent nuances, so your mileage may vary.
Squad: No matter what army you're talking about-merc,
corporate, or national-the squad is still the basic fundamental
unit. Most grunt squads comprise of eight to ten people, most-
ly junior enlisted types led by a buck sergeant, while in mech-
anized units, a single vehicle crew of three to five (still led by a
sergeant) makes up a squad. Occasionally squads may split up
into two teams, but only on a temporary basis.
· Though most squads consist of junior enlisted, in merc circles
you'll also see squads of high-level NCOs (noncommissioned
officers, a.k.a. sergeants) or junior officers led by a senior officer.
Those kinds of squads are actually military advisors-they get
hired on by government or corporate sponsors to train militias or
Insurgents, provide tactical advice, and "report" back to their
clients how their pet armies are doing.
· Arctic White
Platoon: Take three to five squads, add a lieutenant (the
lowest officer level), and you've got yourself a platoon.
Platoons are the smallest unit that can realistically garrison a
compound, so the large majority of remote security contracts
negotiate terms in definition of platoon-sized units. If you ever
see a contract for a squad-sized unit it's likely to be for a small,
short-term mission, like a safari or a quick raid, unless it's an
advisor group.
Company: The company is the next level up, consisting of
three to five platoons and a mid-level commanding officer (like
a captain). Companies have their own internal support struc-
ture (cooks, mechanics, clerks, etc.), so they can stay out in the
field on their own for months at a time. Some of the smaller
merc units out there are actually company-sized units, most of
which are just starting out.
Battalion: A battalion is probably the biggest unit you're
going to find in merc circles. Consisting of three to five com-
panies, a battalion is run by a senior officer (like a full or lieu-
tenant colonel) and actually has its own command staff. It also
has a full company of support units and personnel, so it's self-
sufficient and can operate on its own almost indefinitely. The
large majority of merc organizations out there are actually bat-
talions. Only the big worldwide merc orgs, like MET 2000 or
Tsunami, are larger than battalion-sized.
· Rank is largely relative within merc organizations, since there's
no common system. Most mercs come straight out of military
service, so they usually take the rank they had when they left.
Once they sign in, though, anything goes. There are plenty of
stories of merc privates earning a field commission for combat
leadership and becoming senior officers. (Look at Picador, for
instance.) There are also plenty of stories of merc officers who
got busted to private nobodies after a major, contract-ending
hose-up.
· Raptor
· Some of the larger organizations, like MET 2000 and Tsunami,
do have formal training and promotion programs instituted to
train and promote officers and NCOs, even if you enlisted
straight off the street. Just like with the regular military, however,
getting into these programs requires a considerable amount of
bootlicking and hoop kissing. For example, your odds of getting
a promotion in Tsunami aren't very good if you're a kawaru (or
even worse, a gaijin), unless you know something you can hold
against the brass.
· El Desperado
Jacks of All Trades
Soldiering means being proficient at a lot of difficult tasks
besides fighting. This applies just as much for regular military
service members as it does for mercs. It's a common gripe
amongst soldiers of all stripes: to win in battle, soldiers have to
master many different skills, but there is never enough training
time available to practice all of them adequately.
Next to combat, the most important thing a soldier can
learn is to keep his head down and stay hidden. With the
advent of automatic weapons in the last century, being out in
the open is a surefire way to get a medal awarded posthu-
mously. This is particularly true for those assigned as snipers or
artillery spotters. Once the rounds hit their mark, it won't take
the other side long to figure out where they came from.
Almost as important as that is land navigation, the ability
to figure your way from point A to point B. You would think
that in this age of GPS and advanced autonavigation systems
no one would get lost in the woods, but our NCOs still get a
laugh when some green junior lieutenant gets lost on an exer-
cise. If you can't tell a draw from a valley or understand why
magnetic deflection matters, then all those fancy electronics
will do is make you more confused when you do get lost.
Whether you can find your way through the woods or not,
one very important skill to know is how to survive in the
wilderness. Unlike the sprawl, where you don't have to wan-
der more than a kilometer to find a Stuffer Shack or coffin
motel, these things aren't easily found out in the wilderness.
And between pollution and the Awakening, finding something
that won't kill you when you eat it, drink it, or hide in it is even
harder than it's been before.
. Most people think that toughness and physical endurance
helps your chances of survival. One of the most important things
you can do to improve your odds of surviving is not panic and
keep a clear enough head to remember how to do those for-
aging and sheltering tasks you have to. During my enlistment
with the CAS Army, I went through their grueling Ranger School
course. (In summary, twelve weeks spent in four types of hell.)
One interesting thing I remember is that a lot of the bigger can-
didates were more likely to drop out, because the larger frames
required more maintenance; troll candidates usually were
among the first wave of dropouts. The ones who did the best
were the team player types, who did what they were told to do.
despite being cold, tired, wet, hungry and generally miserable.

Information Warfare
Saying "Information is the only valuable thing today," is trite
and clichéd. Nevertheless it's the truth, both in the shadows and
on the battlefield. Since Echo Mirage, the Matrix has added a
new dimension to warfare for which tacticians have to plan.
Much as in regular military forces, Matrix warfare in merc
forces is pretty specialized and usually not seen in lower eche-
lon units. It's unusual to see deckers in merc companies or
lower, unless the company in question specializes in military
intelligence ops. A typical combat battalion sometimes has a
special team of deckers in their organization, and they loan out
individuals from the team to subordinate companies or pla-
toons as needed and available. There's no room for slackers in
a field unit, so merc deckers still must have basic proficiency in
firearms, survival and other basic soldiering skills.
· Mercs are too on-the-go to be tied down by bulky main-
frames, so merc deckers tend to be more offensive-minded,
loading up particularly on attack and sleaze utilities. Merc
deckers also generally double as senior technicians and elec-
tronic warfare specialists, so they're a lot savvier with the warez
than your typical shadowrunner decker.
· Seminary
. One job that merc deckers tend to draw a lot more than
usual is reconnaissance patrols. Not too surprising: when you're
getting info on the enemy, you cover all the angles including
cyberspace. Most shadowrunners think of combat deckers as
being good shooters, but the truth is that combat deckers are
better sneakers than they are shooters.
· Copperhead
Supertroopers
Strange as it may sound, cybernetic (and bioware) implan-
tation is more common amongst mercenary ranks than it is in
regular corporate or national militaries. Much of the reason has
to do with turnover-in your typical line units, most people
enlist for one term, maybe two, before getting out. Given how
much time and money is invested with cyberware, this high
turnover doesn't justify implantation in regular line units, sub-
sequently limiting it to elite and special forces.
In the merc world, however, more of us here are lifers than
not, so getting implantation is more justifiable amongst us. On
the other hand, don't expect to see many cyborgs or cyber-
zombies here. Unlike the corporate or national forces, we oper-
ate on a limited budget, so any cyberware tends to be the basic
garden variety.
. So if you happen to run into any mercs sporting beta- or
deltaware, consider a tactical retreat, because it means you're
dealing with the best of the best.
· Big Boa
. No, It means you're dealing with the most spendthrift merc units
out there. Let me tell you, our unit has little cyberware, and none
of it even alpha-grade. Yet we've consistently smoked MET 2000
and Tsunami hotshots regularly. How? By training hard, employing
sound tactics and making the most of lucky breaks. Despite what
the MET brass may think, you can't buy yourself a victory.
· Ballidou
Combat Magic
Nowadays, you can't talk about any sort of trade or pro-
fession without mentioning how it's adapted to magic's
appearance in the world. The merc trade's no exception.
Magicians are so useful for just about everything that you'd be
a fool not to have one in your unit.
The biggest mistake I've seen merc units make is using
their magicians as front-line fighters. A lot of their spells are
less effective against armored or mechanized forces, and once
they first start slinging spells, they draw enemy fire. ("Geek the
mage first" is as prevalent here as it is in the shadows.) You
would be better served using magicians in a supporting role,
for reconnaissance, astral defense or medical support. When on
the offensive, use magic as a special weapons team to take out
something you couldn't by conventional means.
. And besides, chances are that the other side has magicians
also. So until you take out the other side's magician, your own
spellslinger is going to be tied up providing spell defense and
other magical countermeasures.
· Warlord Gray
· Don't forget combat engineering. Magicians can dig up
whole trenches with a blink of an eye. In my last unit, we had
one of those aspected conjurer magicians who couldn't cast
spells, but could summon elementals. We used him to call up
earth elementals to dig out entrenchments, lay tracks for our
vehicles, build tank traps and even clear out minefields.
· TDC
One unusual trend I've noticed is that magicians seem to be
more prevalent in lower level merc units than they are in corpo-
rate or national armies. In those armies, they tend to concentrate
their magical assets at the brigade, division or higher levels, only
assigning them sparingly for lower units, typically one per com-
bat battalion. In merc circles, however, we rarely have those
large units, so magicians tend to get spread out more, frequent-
ly appearing at the company and battalion level. I've even seen
a platoon with its own staff mage, but that's really rare.
SITUATION REPORTS
I think I've ranted enough. You wanted to know about the
merc world the past few years, so I should cut to the chase.
MERC HANGOUTS
If you're looking for mercs, we tend to congregate a lot
around military bases, particularly army bases. Part of it's
because many of us are products of the army, and we like asso-
ciating with those who've shared the same experience. Part of
it's also for recruitment purposes. Veterans leave the services
every day, and most of them don't know what to do after-
wards. A lot of them end up with us.
· Since the Salish-Tsimshian border war flared up, there's been
a lot of buzz going around in the suburbs around Fort Lewis, par-
ticularly Tillicum and Stellacoom, as Johnsons on both sides of
the border have been hiring mercs left and right. This has made
the MPs on Fort Lewis a little jumpy, especially since both are
close to where General Colloton has her headquarters.
· TacFire
Lisbon
Ever since the beginning of the Eurowars, the capital of
Portugal has become one of the primary mercenary havens in
the world, if not the biggest altogether. After the action ended
during the Russian campaign, Alliance for Allah forces out of
Morocco staged an amphibious assault into Spain and Portugal
across the Straits of Gibraltar. With Portuguese forces deployed
in Central Europe, the Portuguese government and local mega-
corps hastily contracted dozens of merc units to defend against
the Islamic incursion and eventually repulse Alliance invaders
from Portuguese territory.
Since then, the merc presence in Lisbon has grown
thanks to ongoing hostilities in North Africa, not to mention its
relative proximity to the Desert Wars theater in what used to
be Libya. Additionally, the influx of Brazilian refugees fleeing
from the Amazonian takeover of Brazil have inextricably tied
Lisbon to conflicts in South America, particularly those around
the Amazon.
. Ah, Lisbon. That charming hellhole of cutthroats that I call
home. Not only is this the place to come to get the scoop on
wars from Caracas to Cairo, but it also boasts some of the
wildest and most decadent nightlife west of Berlin. There's a
reason the locals call it "A Cidade do Delinquo" (Sin City): night-
clubs, fight pits, bordellos and gambling dens line the dockside
areas and outlying regions.
· Flak Jack
Of course, mercenary contracting is not Lisbon's only
claim to fame. Tourism is also a major money maker, thanks
to Lisbon's eclectic mix of Iberian, Brazilian and Moorish cul-
tures. Thanks to the seaquake and flood that washed out most
of downtown Lisbon in 2021, the cityscape is an unusual mix-
ture of eighteenth century mansions and twenty-first century
glass towers.
The city also has a thriving smuggling trade going, dealing
with the Barbary Coast and Canary Islands, not to mention
Mediterranean smugglers from Malta, Greece and Lebanon. If
you're looking for black beetles from Maghreb, wild desert
paracritters from Africa, exotic telesma from Amazonia or mil-
itary electronics from Israel, Lisbon's a good bet to find it.
· If you're thinking about getting a cut of Lisbon's smuggling
scene, watch out for the Kussondulola Ghost Cartel. The
Kussondulola originated from the Galo Negro, an Afro-
European policlub, but their interest turned away from politics
towards organized crime. The Kussondulola control most of the
smuggling scene between Lisbon and Africa and they are ruth-
less. Their leader, Jah Soba, was apparently indicted for war
crimes in Angola several years ago.
· Sepherim
· Don't deal with Soba. Ever. He's persona non grata in Lisbon's
merc community, and with good reason.
· Flak Jack
Macao
As Lisbon is to the West, so is Macao to the East.
Considering that Macao used to be a Portuguese colony, the
symmetry is particularly fitting. Sitting on the mouth of the
Pearl River opposite from Hong Kong, Macao reverted back to
Chinese rule a few years after Hong Kong returned to China.
Like Hong Kong, Macao enjoyed special administrative status
after returning to Chinese rule, but unlike its Chinese-British
counterpart, did not attract a lot of big business interests.
Instead, Macao attracted other interests, particularly organized
crime, due to the legal status of gambling in its territory.
· Syndicate activity is still pretty strong in Macao. In addition to
gambling, the syndicates also have their fingers in Macao's
chip and flesh trade. Because of the stranglehold the Triads
have over the Hong Kong underworld, both the Yakuza and the
Rings moved to Macao instead. They still have to contend with
the local Macao Triads, though.
· China Doll
· Gunrunning and smuggling is also a notable trade in
Macao's underworld. Most of them are independents, but
quite a few smuggling operations are run by the Rings. The
smuggling is two way, with Russian and Chinese arms being
sold to Guangxi and Vietnamese pirates, and heroin and
Indochinese magical compounds flowing back to Vladivostok
and Shanghai.
· Mekong Michelle
Macao started becoming a mercenary haven in the late
twenty-twenties, during a border clash between the Canton
Confederation and the Guangxi nation, both recently emerged
from the rubble of China's collapse. Since then, the ongoing
recurrence of brushfire wars and civil disturbances in Southeast
Asia and amongst the Chinese warlords has kept Macao in
business. And with the recent withdrawal of the Japanese from
the Philippines, both the Huk and the Japanacorps have been
visiting Macao to look for reinforcements willing to entangle
themselves down there.
· Macao is a real rough-and-tumble territory, and I don't mean
that in a good sense. It always seems to be in the shadows of
Hong Kong, so its nightlife doesn't seem quite as lively. I really
don't understand why Combat, Inc. decided to move back
here. Hong Kong seems like a much safer place to do business.
· China Doll
· From what I've heard, Combat, Inc. didn't really have a choice.
· Johnny Hotel
· With the new Gobi Wars spinoff set to air for the upcoming
season, the merc activity around here has picked up quite a
bit. CBC and ABS negotiators have been spending a lot of time
in Macao recently. On the other hand, so have representatives
from the Henan neo-communists, as well as the Imperial
Kingdom of Beijing. I don't think they buy the Gobl Wars as a
purely media spectacle.
· Tai Ho Leng
Constantinople
Mercs tend to gather around merc havens like Lisbon and
Macao because they're relatively close to major conflict zones.
But in the case of Constantinople, it's located smack in the mid-
dle of one.
Formerly known by its Turkish name of Istanbul,
Constantinople used to be a part of Turkey up until the end of the
Euro-Wars in 2036. During that year, Mullah Sayid Jazrir, clerical
head of the Alliance for Allah, was assassinated while touring
Istanbul, and the Alliance collapsed. Turkey itself split apart,
between western ottomans seeking to form a secular state and
eastern fundamentalists trying to keep the Alliance alive. Istanbul
itself got caught in the crossfire until 2042, when it seceded from
Turkey, renamed itself as Constantinople and claimed the region
around the Bosfor Straits as an independent commonwealth. It
received immediate recognition from Ukraine, who sent warships
across the Black Sea to support Constantinople's claim, thus fore-
stalling any reaction by the other warring Turkish factions.
. The Ukrainians weren't the only ones pushing for
Constantinople's claim. During Constantinople's first few years
after independence, they got a lot of financial aid and military
contracts from Saeder-Krupp. Considering that S-K had just
acquired the Caspian pipelines tapping the Russian oil fields on
the other side of the Black Sea, they probably wanted to make
sure their tankers had secure passage through the Bosfor Straits.
· Felix
Even today, Constantinople maintains a precarious exis-
tence. The split between secular west and religious east in the
rest of Turkey still creates occasional flare-ups and clashes
between factions. Meanwhile in Europe, Bulgaria, Romania and
the Balkans have fragmented into quarrelling Muslim, Western
and Slavic enclaves. And let's not forget the nearby Middle
East and its perpetual Arab-Israeli antagonisms. Were it not for
the fact that so many mercs congregate in Constantinople reg-
ularly, it would have fallen back into chaos many years ago.
· Constantinople is an odd town to live in. As the name change
suggests, the region has undergone a Byzantine revival, but the
Muslim and Arabic influences are still around. Though Turkish still
remains the official language, the written alphabet has
switched from Roman characters to Cyrillic. Ukrainian is the sec-
ond most popular language, though many residents also
understand Greek and Russian as well.
· Zartan
· Though Constantinople is a nominally secular state, the
Orthodox Church wields a lot of influence in daily life. (No sur-
prise, since Constantinople was the Orthodoxy's birthplace.)
The Orthodoxy's return to its historical roots has raised concern
within the Vatican. Word is that the New Jesuits are trying to set
up a mission in Constantinople to see what the Constantinople
Orthodoxy may be up to.

The Outpost
The Outpost is an unusual mercenary haven. It has no
physical location, but rather exists solely on the Matrix. The
hardware is built on the old American AUTOVON system, a
network that connected American military posts across the
country and also NATO posts in western Europe. As the United
States withdrew from Europe and later broke up following the
Treaty of Denver, many military installations in ex-US territories
were shut down but the AUTOVON infrastructure remained
mostly untouched. (After all, why waste time digging up thou-
sands of kilometers of cable?)
For a long time the AUTOVON infrastructure lay forgotten.
until the early 2040s. Mercs in the newly-defined field of
Matrix warfare (most of them Eurowars veterans) decided to
set up their own haven and dug up all the records for the old
AUTOVON system. With a few well-placed calls around Europe
and North America, they managed to acquire several of the
more remote AUTOVON nodes (mostly for minor depots). A
few upgrades later, they created a distributed network, later
dubbed the Outpost.
Since then, the Outpost has become a primary virtual
haven for mercenaries worldwide. Here mercs deployed in
Johannesburg can swap war stories with counterparts in Fort
Lewis, while others search job lists for current and upcoming
contracts. One of the subprocessors, the War Room, features a
3-dimensional globe tracking various military conflicts (merce-
nary-related or not) around the world. But probably the most
popular feature is a virtual room called "The Range," where
merc deckers can hone their combat decking skills, either
against IC targets or against each other.
· Terms of service for using the Range forbid usage of any lethal
or deck-damaging utilities; after all, the Range exists for prac-
tice. There is a sub-channel on the Range, however, for grudge
matches where anything goes. The admins deny it exists, but
they turn a blind eye as long as they get paid off in advance.
· Kraker-Jack
. Man, I can't believe that rumor is still going around. The
grudge matches are a myth. End of story.
· Televiper
· Sure, you'd say that, being an admin and all.

BROTHERS IN ARMS
In the past half-century or so of wars, a few mercenary
organizations have managed to distinguish themselves in com-
bat and rise to prominence, rivaling even some of the world
powers. Here's a look at some of the top merc organizations
right now.
MET 2000
Based out of Hannover, Germany, MET 2000 is the largest
mercenary organization in the world, with several divisions on
assignment across Europe, the Middle East and Africa. With
major backers including the German confederate government,
the German defense manufacturer Ruhrmetall and Euro-indus-
trial giant IFMU, MET 2000 has the financial muscle to raise,
train and equip large mercenary battalions. It should come as
no surprise that they specialize in armored and mechanized
infantry combat.
Though MET 2000 is capable of worldwide deployment, in
reality the large majority of their work takes them to Africa, the
Middle East and the Balkans. They have had some tours in
South America and India, though those are few compared to
the other contracts. As part of their funding agreement with the
German government, they still have to maintain a standing
garrison in Germany as a national reserve. Consequently, most
of their service obligation is spent patrolling the border around
the SOX nuclear wasteland.
· They may have the biggest tanks and the loudest explosions,
but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're the best. Their
unofficial motto is "Tactics? Who needs tactics when you've got
advanced weaponry?" All that equipment and training may
give them the advantage on the battlefield, but if you put up a
decent fight and pull a surprise here and there, they'll fold like
a house of cards.
· Ballidou
. I'd expect you to say that, Ballidou. Still sore from that hoop-
kicking we gave you in Tunis last year? Just name the time and
place-we'll show up for the rematch and kick your hoop all
over again.
· METalhead
· | thought Matador's loathing of MET 2000 was simply a per-
sonal pet peeve, but from all the reports I read about Tunis, I
can see why Matador felt the way he did. You'd better hope I
don't find you've been in the Northwest when Matador went
down, or there'll be trouble the next time I'm in Lisbon.
· Picador
Tsunami
Tsunami is number two in size, but not by much.
Headquartered in Okinawa, Tsunami is also a worldwide orga-
nization, though they tend to favor Pacific theaters. Like
MET2000, Tsunami also has a sizeable amount of outside spon-
sorship, mostly from the Japanacorps. Unlike MET2000, they
tend to spend their venture capital more on chrome and
bioware rather than armored vehicles and heavy weapons. On
an individual level, a Tsunami merc is probably more danger-
ous than a MET2000 merc, simply because of all the implants
the Tsunami guy is packing.
· What I said about MET2000 I also say about Tsunami. They may
have flashy chrome, but that doesn't mean they're better. Too
often they rely a lot on chipped skills. That may be okay in ordi-
nary situations, but combat is hardly an ordinary situation. Skills
learned the hard way are a lot more reliable.
· Ballidou
· Because they receive a lot of backing from the Japanacorps.
it tends to dictate a lot of their policies. For example, Tsunami
employs very few metahuman mercs and their officer ranks are
completely human and mostly Asian. This has recently put them
In a bind, because the Imperial Regent has been pressuring
them to open up to metahumans. If they don't, the Imperial
government has implied they might revoke Tsunami's special
extraterritorial status on Okinawa.
· Akyna
10,000 Daggers
Based out of Constantinople, 10K Daggers was founded
a few years after Constantinople's independence by several
ex-Ukrainian officers and Turkish war veterans. Unlike
MET2000 or Tsunami, the Daggers don't have a lot of
advanced equipment. They make up for it by being experts in
their specialty: commando operations, long-range reconnais-
sance and other assorted black ops. These guys are particu-
larly masterful at night operations; I've heard they hire a lot
of orks and elves for their exceptional night vision. Take it
from me, these guys are real sneaky bastards; getting the
jump on them is very rare.
. 10K Daggers doesn't seem to have any major backers, but
they do seem to be pretty well off. Probably because they get
paid well for all those black ops they do. They do seem to have
a lot of influence within the Constantinople government, but
that's no surprise. Constantinople needs the Daggers more
than the other way round.
· Flak Jack
· Everyone thinks that Mossad was behind the hit on Ibn Eisa
(even the man himself), but I have to wonder if maybe the
Daggers might have done it and pinned the blame on the
Israelis. After all, Ibn Eisa was pushing for a united Islamic gov-
ernment, and that would include Turkey as well. That would def-
initely not sit well with Constantinople, who could possibly call in
a favor from the Daggers.
· Zartan
. I'll bet the Israelis are hoping that the Jihad is considering that
possibility too.

Combat Inc.
Originally headquartered in Hong Kong in the New
Territories, Combat Inc. recently announced that they were
moving across the Pearl River Estuary to nearby Macao.
Regardless of location, Combat Inc. is the top mercenary con-
tractor in the Pacific Rim, both on the Eastern and Western
Hemisphere. Their particular specialty is operations in
Southeast Asia and Australia.
· Combat Inc.'s relocation to Macao wasn't exactly voluntary.
They ran afoul of Wuxing back during the Orichalcum Rush,
when natural orichalcum was popping up all around. As fate
would have it, every time Wuxing tried to jump a new claim,
they found Combat Inc. troops already there on guard for their
various clients (namely Shiawase, Mitsuhama and the
Atlantean Foundation). After the fifth or so run-in between the
two, Wuxing sent a message to Combat Inc. that Hong Kong
wasn't big enough for the two of them.
. Johnny Hotel
. They may not have to worry about Wuxing for a while. Lately
they've been getting a lot of contracts in North America, both
for the Salish-Tsimshian border war and the Mojave war. There's
word they're also planning to enter into a bidding war with
Tsunami for some of the Peruvian border contracts as well.

BATTLEFIELDS
The world has changed a lot in the past few years. Some
hotspots have died down, while others have faded to the point
where, while both sides hate each other, actual hostilities don't
take place. On the other hand, new hostilities in new places
have arisen. Here's a list of the current mercenary favorites.
North America
Right now, there is no place hotter in terms of military con-
flict than the North American continent. The Salish-Tsimshian
Border War, possible civil war in the Algonkian-Manitou
Council, Saito's California campaign, Pueblo entanglements in
the Mojave or the continual Mexican standoff in Texas-there's
no shortage of work opportunities west of the Mississippi.
The Philippines
The recent withdrawal of Imperial Japanese forces from the
Philippines has left the region in a lurch. Without the Marines
to avoid, the Huk have unleashed havoc across the islands and
the Japanacorps in the region have come under fire from rebel
retaliation, forcing them to augment their security with merce-
nary assistance. It may be a long time before peace and order
return to the Philippines.
· Japanese apologist. We don't want your kind of help, you
hired murderer. We'll bring about our own justice!
· Tikbalang
· Justice? Don't you mean revenge? Where is the justice in
slaughtering innocent researchers and Filipino workers at
Renraku's marine lab on Leyte? At least when the Marines were
here, we had order. You Huk terrorists are no better than the
Imperial oppressors.
· Naing
The Yucatán
The Yucatán has always been a hot conflict zone, but
Aztlan's recent reversals of fortune have worsened the turmoil.
Despite their military presence, Aztlan forces seem to be a rout
away from full retreat. The rebels, however, aren't faring well
either. Though they're not being slaughtered wholesale by the
Azzies, they've still been unable to take advantage of Aztlan's
misfortunes. If anything, contract prospects for the Yucatán
campaign have increased on both sides.
· The pay may be better, but I am more resolute than ever
before about not accepting a Yucatán contract. From what
my magician friends tell me, the war has spilled over into the
spirit world, with toxics on one side, nature spirits on the other
and both the Azzies and the rebels caught in the middle. If I go
somewhere, I would like to have at least some assurance of
coming back spiritually intact.
· Arctic White
Peru
With the withdrawal of Japanese military forces from Peru
as well as the sudden flare up around the Nasca Lines, relations
between Peru and Amazonia have degenerated rapidly.
Amazonia has threatened to see that the Japanacorps operat-
ing in Peru follow the Imperial Marines in leaving South
America. Add to that increased activity from Sendero
Luminoso and the Ghost Cartels, and you've got a grab bag of
opportunities. Quite a few companies I've known have gotten
contracts to patrol the Peru-Amazonia border. Furthermore, the
bulletin boards of the Outpost have been stuffed with contract
offers from the various Japanacorps to protect their compounds
deep in the Peruvian jungles.
Africa
The "Dark Continent" has always been a ready source of
work for mercs. Ever since they started cutting loose from their
European colonizers, there's always been fighting going on at
one place or another on the continent. If anything, it seems like
magic's return has exacerbated the conflicts even more.
Recently, two significant events have lit up the continent
anew on the War Room globe. Down around Kenya, the mega-
corps were set and ready to build a mass driver at the summit
of Mount Kilimanjaro until spirits native to the mountain
attacked the corporate teams and put those plans to a halt.
Local warlords over the borders in Somalia, Ethiopia and
Tanzania have taken advantage of the chaos to cross the border
and raid corporate holdings in Kenya. Things just seem to go
from bad to worse for the corps and the Kenyan government.
· Sounds like a classic case of the schoolyard bully getting a
black eye. When the other kids see someone stand up to the
bully and win, they aren't afraid of him any more. If I was the
corps, I'd better put down the locals first, or else they're going
to be too preoccupied to worry about the mountain.
· Huey Short
The other event that's gotten Africa fired up took place on
the western end of the continent, in the ghoul nation of
Asamando. For a while Asamando had been sitting pretty, as
deposits of naturally occurring orichalcum started appearing
next to Asamando's hauls of gold, diamonds and other pre-
cious metals. But when the orichalcum veins started to dry up,
so did Asamando's dreams of glory. In May, the Asante Nation
started cracking down hard on the smuggling of metahuman
flesh into the Asamando Nation, claiming that the trade, traffic
and stockpiling of dead bodies posed a serious threat from
shedim possessing them.
Before you knew it, both sides had engaged in several
bloody border skirmishes almost bordering on war. For a
while it looked like the two would deadlock into another
stalemate, but a few months ago, Asamando forces inexplic-
ably pulled back and retreated within their borders. The
Asante now control the intervening countryside between the
two nations, but two attempts they have made to invade
Asamando have been repulsed. From what my friends in
Lisbon are saying, the Asante have put out a call for merce-
nary reinforcements for a third push.
. Thanks, but no thanks. I don't intend to become ghoul chow.
· /\ng3lph54r
· The Asante aren't the only ones looking for merc assistance in
this little war. DeBeers Omnitech has a refinery and processing
plant on the Volta, about halfway between Asante and
Asamando. DBO doesn't want to be taking any chances it can
afford not to.
· Flak Jack
· The one thing I found odd is Asamando's sudden unex-
plained retreat. Anyone got any ideas? Me, I think Asante's
warnings of the shedim threat are valid, and Asamando may
be taking it on the chin for it. And from what I've heard in
Lisbon, quite a few DBO execs looking for merc protection also
feel the same as the Asante.

Yakut (Siberia)
Ever since the Siberians took most of Siberia from the
Russians, it's been a near-constant skirmish between the two
forces along the length of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Both
sides made pushes to try to shift the borders, but neither side
has had success in rewriting geography.
Well, I don't know if that's going to change in the near
future. I do know that there's been a lot of new contracts float-
ing around Constantinople for merc work in Central Asia. Some
of them are for legit garrison work, but a few I've recognized
as front companies for the UGB Border Guards, as well as the
MVD. If I know the Russians, they're up to something. Consider
yourself warned.
· The word that's been floating around Kaliningrad is that the
UGB think that the Siberians have had some sort of internal
falling out. From the small databits we sussed out of the UGB sys-
tems, something happened last year that shook things up in
Yakutsk. That's all I've got; make of it what you will.
· Westend Girl
· I'll bet it's SURGE. All these Awakened folk go on bragging

oted as anyone else. Serves them right if they got a taste of their
own medicine.

TOOLS OF THE TRADE
If you're going to operate in the merc world, you have to
have at least passing familiarity, if not thorough proficiency, in
the equipment we use. Most people tend to focus on the guns
and explosives and overlook the other, less glamorous support
equipment. Big mistake. If you don't think about the field gear,
you won't even be in adequate fighting condition when the
shooting starts.
THE GREAT OUTDOORS
Fighting out in the field is nothing like running in the city.
Too many times I have seen shadowrunners equipped for a
mission like a walk in the city park, only to be taken out of
action not by bullets or fireballs, but by hypothermia, malnu-
trition or Montezuma's Revenge. Any time you go into the
wilderness for an extended time, you have to know how to
survive out there and prepare accordingly. It doesn't have to
wait for a trip to the Mojave, North Africa or Siberia; even this
evergreen haven called the Pacific Northwest can be deadly
for the unprepared.
Outdoor Equipment
Modern camping gear shies away from heavy, high-main-
tenance canvas and takes advantage of lightweight nylon,
polypropylene and Kevlar weaves. Electric fuel cell and
improved battery technology has not only resulted in quieter
field generators, but also compact power cells to improve
heaters, lights and other powered equipment. With the right
equipment, you can make a month-long patrol feel no worse
than a few days in the house.
Survival Tents: If you ever find yourself going to Siberia,
the Mojave or any other harsh environment, I would strongly
recommend you take these along. These single-person pup
tents come with a compressed gas cartridge, thus making the
tent self-inflatable by jerking the rip cord. Additionally, the tent
is insulated and contains a self-powered climate control unit
that can either heat or cool the tent (but not both, so you'll
have to choose beforehand). Most brands usually say the cli-
mate control lasts 48 hours, but with a little judicious rationing,
you can stretch it to about three times that duration.
. One other thing Picador forgot to mention is that these tents
also come with an emergency radio transponder that helps
search-and-rescue teams to locate them. If you're out in the
field on a recon or covert op, though, the last thing you want is
some emergency transponder giving your position away! As
standard procedure, our unit always disables all the emergency
transponders except one in the case of extreme emergency.
· Breaker
Rations: Forget the barely-edible canned C-rats and paraf.
fin heaters you see in those old war flatvids. Modern fielc
rations come prepackaged in hermetically sealed plastic, and
some of them are actually pretty
decent. (One of our sergeants actually
eats these everyday, even in garrison.
Yes, I think he's strange also.)
Additionally, practically all rations
contain their own internal heating ele-
ments, generally activated by expo-
sure to air or adding water into the
heating pouch. These heating elements
can also be used for other purposes,
such as hand warmers, heaters or fire
starters. Our company mechanic actu-
ally saves these up to dry off the
primer cells and ignition switches for
our generators and vehicles!
. Here's another trick some veteran
mercs know about ration heaters: the
water-activated
heaters produce
hydrogen gas when it reacts with water,
so these veterans crumble up the heat-
ing chemical and stuff it into a plastic
bag or bottle. Add a little bit of water,
and you've got yourself an improvised
explosive. Most of the time the vets use
these "bottle bombs" as a firecracker or
smoke bomb to distract the enemy, but
a few of the clever ones can whip up an
improvised grenade or mine with them.

Camouflage Equipment
Camouflage is a valuable art that is
often poorly practiced. Depending on
the circumstances, camouflage-patterned clothing and face
paint is simply not enough. Sometimes more specialized cam-
ouflage equipment may be required.
"Ghillie" Suits: Sometimes the most fundamental con-
cepts are the most effective. A ghillie suit is a poncho-like
cloak that drapes over the entire body. Unlike a regular pon-
cho, a ghillie suit has layers of cloth strips, netting, simulated
foliage and other assorted garnishings sewn across the fabric,
not to mention additional holes and straps for the wearer to
improve upon the pattern. All of these add-ons serve to oblit-
erate the body outline and makes a person practically invisible
amongst the terrain when lying still. Field snipers commonly
use this suit when they're in place and ready to shoot.
· Yeah, but the main downside to ghillie suits is that they make
it almost impossible to move around when wearing one. The
best you can do is a slow crawl, and you can forget about run-
ning in one of these!
· Longarm
· Not always, depending on the type of ghillie suit you're
wearing. Some adventure catalogs offer what's called a stalk-
er suit, as a "lite" ghillie suit. Okay, it's not as good as a full-
blown ghillie suit, but it does allow you to make a slow jog
while you're wearing one.
· Grognement
· If you can find one, get yourself a ruthenium poncho. It takes
the ghillie suit concept one step further and uses ruthenium
weaves to literally blend in with the environment. Furthermore,
the poncho doesn't have all those gewgaws attached to it to
slow the wearer down, but the poncho shape does smudge up
the body outline enough to be more effective than a sneak
suit. The only down side is availability: you're not going to find a
ruthenium poncho in your basic outdoor adventure catalog.
· Bateau
Camouflage Nets: Concealing yourself is all well and
good, but if your vehicle, bivouac or emplacement isn't also
concealed, it's not going to do you one bit of good. To cover
large objects or areas, mercs often use camouflage nets, large
diamond or hexagonal-shaped netting with synthetic leafings
and foliage sewn in between the gaps. Additionally, camou-
flage nets also incorporate painted metal reflectors and ther-
mal-baffling materials in their composition, so they're equally
effective against technological sensors as they are against the
Mark I eyeball.
. The biggest mistake I see made in the field with camouflage
netting is that soldiers often drape it over vehicles or tents, way
out in the open. Like that's going to help! You need to use poles
with spreaders (which come with every netting system) to hoist
it over the object you're covering, with at least half a meter of
spacing, so as to break up the object's profile.

Web Gear
Web gear: rucksacks, combat vests, load bearing harness-
es and other assorted belts, pouches, hooks and loops used for
hauling equipment. So basic that they're taken for granted, but
if you don't have it, you won't be able to take along the gear
you need. Even worse, if you have the wrong kind of web gear,
you could lose precious minutes rummaging for the specific
equipment you're looking for.
Generally speaking, you should configure your harnesses
for the specific mission. In our unit, we prefer combat vests that
have very few pockets but lots of pouch loops for hanging
ammo and gear pouches. That way, we can add or remove
specific pouches as necessary for the upcoming mission.
In our unit, we reserve rucksacks (sometimes known as
backpacks in the civilian world) for extended field missions.
Though they come in many sizes, our sergeants preach to our
troops to carry only a small ruck unless carrying necessary spe-
cialist gear. With a large ruck, the temptation is to overload it
with excess equipment, which slows you down in combat.
· One other thing to look for in a ruck: a quick-release assem-
bly on the shoulder and waist pads allowing you to drop the
ruck on the ground in a split second. Most military rucksacks will
have these, but you may not find it on a regular camping back-
pack in your general sporting-goods store. Believe me, when
bullets are flying thicker than tsetse flies in the air, you want to
get rid of that excess weight in a hurry!
· Dancin' Hanson
HELL ON WHEELS
Make no mistake, despite all the developments in the past
century, combat still comes down to the footsoldier carrying a
rifle. But in the past century or so, vehicles have become an
indispensable part of modern combat. They carry a lot more
equipment than your common grunt, get from point A to point
B faster, protect against weapons and the elements and pack
one hell of a punch.
When people think about mechanized warfare, they most-
ly fixate on tanks and t-birds, but in a lot of merc work, the pri-
mary vehicle workhorse is the infantry fighting vehicle. A lot of
our work involves getting up close and personal, mano a
mano, with the locals or with the enemy. You just can't do that
in a tank or t-bird. When you're trying to flush guerillas out of
the woods, a squad of infantry backed up by an armored IFV
mounting a chain gun works every time.
Drones are also an important asset. They can get into all
those places an IFV or even a jeep can't, but they're still resis-
tant to small arms and can carry those heavy weapons. They
also have a lot of drawbacks, too. Their decision-making is pret-
ty lousy, and their skills aren't all that great. You'd be best off
using them for laying down suppressive fire. Anything requiring
controlled precision fire should stay in the hands of your grunts.
. There's also the electronic warfare problem. A good jammer
will cut those drones off from your remote control network, or
even worse, turn your own drones against you. If you're going to
use drones, make sure you have good ECCM and encryption
protecting your network.
· MC Jammer
Artillery
It may not mean all that much to you in the shadows, but
to us artillery fire support is crucial. In national militaries,
artillery tends to be concentrated at high-level commands, but
given the smaller size of merc units, it's been finding its way
down to the lower levels, even as far as the company level.
. That's not always the case, but Picador's pointing out a trend
that's starting to be popular. Too often merc forces get burned
by their government or corporate clients, who promise fire sup-
port in the contract but always find some more urgent priority
when the fighting gets hot and heavy. A lot of mercs I know are
starting to clue in on the merits of having your own artillery,
answerable to no one but you.
· Colonel Cobra
One important rule to follow is not to stock up too much
on artillery forces. While it's invaluable when needed, battles
are still won and lost in the trenches. Most professional mili-
taries usually establish a fixed ratio of one artillery battery
(artillery term for company) supporting a maneuver battalion
(consisting of three or four armor or infantry companies), about
a 3:1 ratio. That's not a bad yardstick to follow, if you ask me.
Because of its sheer size and weight, most artillery
inevitably ends up as vehicle-mounted weapon systems. While
there are some portable mortar systems out there (like the M-
12), the firepower of even a massed platoon isn't sufficient for
anything but torquing off the enemy, in my opinion. On the
other hand, you don't want too heavy an artillery piece,
because mercs inevitably tend to get dropped into the most
inaccessible places. An airdrop-capable piece is highly sug-
gested. I would particularly recommend a heavy mortar or light
howitzer system (both about 100-120 millimeter caliber). Both
sizes are pretty suitable for company or battalion-level opera-
tions. Hell, if you've got nuyen to blow, you could even get a
section or two to support a platoon operation.
Improved Conventional Munitions: There are lots of dif-
ferent munitions available for heavy artillery, but if you ask
me, the best general-purpose, all around use shell would be
the improved conventional munition (ICM). When these
things are just above their intended target, they burst open in
midair, releasing hundreds of miniature submunitions that
scatter and detonate on impact. Unlike conventional high-
explosives, which create tremendous blast in the center but
only marginal concussive damage further out, the blast dam-
age is applied evenly across the same area. This makes it par-
ticularly useful for taking out formations, encampments and
other targets where you've got multiple soft targets spread
over an area.
. There's also another type of ICM available called the dual
purpose improved conventional munition (DP-ICM). The submu-
nitions in a DP-ICM shell are shaped charges, which maintain a
downward orientation by trailing a streamer behind them.
They're effective against unarmored or lightly armored vehi-
cles, but they don't do all that much against heavily armored
targets like a tank or t-bird.
· Molyneaux
FIRE IN THE HOLE
I suppose there has to be some basis to all the clichés
and stereotypes. Much as I hate to admit it, it is true that we
mercs handle explosives and demolitions work more often
than shadowrunners. Probably has something to do with this
delusional conceit about shadowrunning being a quiet pro-
fession.
· One of the first mistakes a novice sapper (demolitions spe-
cialist) makes is assuming that anything can be blown with
more explosives. While this is generally true, there are two things
working against this. First, big explosions have big side effects;
too much collateral damage can sometimes be worse than
mission failure. Second, no matter how much you can haul, you
will never have enough explosives to do the job. Being a good
sapper means getting the most damage with the least explo-
sives.
· Jackhammer
Bangalore Torpedo: A bangalore torpedo is a pretty use-
ful tool to have for clearing minefields, short of having a com-
bat engineer squad in direct support. Consisting of ten solid
explosive cylinders, about 1.5 meters long and only a few cen-
timeters in diameter, these sections are screwed together to
the appropriate length, slid into a minefield and then detonat-
ed, clearing a path approximately half a meter wide free of
mines, concertina and other antipersonnel obstacles.
· Picador overstates the bangalore's capability slightly. While
the explosive core of the bangalore has improved over time, so
have the resistance of many mines and concertina wire. If
there's one thing that these things are absolutely brutal
against, however, it's monowire. For all the cutting power it has,
monowire doesn't have a lot of resistance to shear stress.
· Drake
· Maybe so, but bangalores are still pretty useful if for nothing
else than their improvisation value. Come on, we're talking
about a one and a half meter pipe bomb! The threads on the
ends of each section are compatible with plumbing pipe, so
you can intersperse with ordinary pipes to create a gap in the
explosion. You can even substitute bangalores for regular pipes;
on one extraction job we had in a chemical plant, we were
able to infiltrate the site the day before as a maintenance
team and replaced several sections of piping with bangalores.
When we made our run the next night, we detonated the ban-
galores behind us on our escape route, which tied up the
guards and allowed us to make good on our getaway.

Claymore Mine: This basic fragmentation mine is still a
mainstay among combat forces around the world because it's
so simple to use. All a soldier has to do is set it in the ground,
sight it ("Front Towards Enemy") and set the blasting cap. Then
when the enemy walk into the kill zone, all that's required is to
squeeze the detonation clacker. Furthermore, the blasting cap
uses a standard voltage, so a resourceful soldier can improvise
to make a tripwire or hook up to a basic proximity sensor.
Claymores can even be daisy chained with others to increase
the area of effect.
· Just make sure you're either under cover or a good distance
behind the claymore when it goes off. These things have a
nasty backblast Inside of 16 meters.
· MacDoog
Cratering Charges: These things are heavy, but they're
great for tearing up big holes in the ground. Though it weighs
in at more than fifty kilos, most of it is taken up by the heavy
rocket charge. To use these things, you set up the tripod stand
and sling the rocket charge into the harness. Once it detonates,
the rocket launches directly into the ground and burrows about
2-3 meters before the time-delay fuse sets off the main charge
deep in the ground, resulting in a giant crater between 6 and
8 meters in diameter-very useful for tearing up large sections
of roadway and creating tank traps.
. And if you can find enough construction material to turn it on
its side, also very useful for busting through reinforced barriers
and walls.
· Cherry Bomb
Detonation Cord: Though hardly seen outside of combat
engineering or civil demolition circles, det cord is a very basic
staple of demolition operations. Basically, det cord consists of a
flexible fabric tube filled with high explosives. The real advan-
tage, though, is that det cord is engineered to transmit the det-
onation wave very rapidly, even faster than ordinary electrical
wire. This makes it instrumental if you've got some really com-
plex demolition set-up going; you can't afford to wait even the
split section delay between electrical wire and det cord.
Mine Detection Gear: Mine detection gear has changed a
lot in the past half century. With the advances in plastic explo-
sives and semi-conductive polymers, ordinary metal detectors
are practically obsolete. Modern mine detection gear involves
some sort of spectrographic analyzer that "sniffs" out explo-
sives, aided by some sort of ultraviolet or high-radiation cata-
lyst to encourage outgassing. It's not as accurate as modern
security scanners, but it's a lot more portable, and a hell of a lot
better than crawling on the ground probing with a long stick.
GAME INFORMATION
This section provides game information and rules for using
the material presented in Soldiers of Fortune. Included in this
section are rules and statistics for new equipment and infor-
mation and suggestions for gamemasters interested in running
a Shadowrun merc campaign.
RUNNING A MERCENARY CAMPAIGN
Running a merc campaign is substantially different than
an ordinary shadowrunner campaign. Besides the generally
higher caliber of weaponry involved, a mercenary run takes
place among different surroundings and circumstances than
a normal shadowrun.
The major difference between merc runs and ordinary
shadowruns is the relative scarcity of human contact during
merc runs. Most shadowruns take place in a city or other
urban sprawl so shadowrunners almost constantly interact
with other NPCs, whether for legwork, obtaining gear or ser-
vices or regular daily interaction. Mercs, on the other hand,
spend most of their assignments in the field and so only see
other people on an occasional basis. This can become a chal-
lenge for gamemasters, since roleplaying interaction is signif-
icantly reduced.
A helpful tool gamemasters may use is to play up the sus-
pense of any would-be encounters, even those that turn out to
be false alarms. A lot of combat missions consist of long, bor-
ing hours of feeling stressed-out waiting for something to hap-
pen, punctuated by brief moments of frenzied activity when
something actually does happen. Mercs on a mission are out in
the field mostly by themselves and in most cases do not want
to run into anyone else. So whenever something happens,
gamemasters should play up the suspense of a would-be
encounter. Is it the enemy? Have they spotted the mercs? Are
they moving in to attack? Or is it just some damn deer skipping
through the woods?
Contracts
Merc work revolves heavily around the contract between
the merc's unit and his employer. Unlike normal shadowruns,
which generally involve a single job or mission for a limited
duration of time, a merc contract can span from several weeks
to several months, and during that time there may be multiple
separate missions the employer may require the merc to per-
form. In a merc campaign, a contract can serve as a story arc
or mini-campaign, tying several separate adventures together.
Guide Contacts
A guide is a special type of contact unique to merc cam-
paigns. Guides are local residents who know the lay of the land
intimately and can help a merc unit function in unfamiliar terri-
tory. Guides can often be more valuable than simple map read-
ing; guides have an intuitive feel for the land and know things
that wouldn't appear on a map (like the types and habits of
local flora and fauna, attitudes of local villagers, and so on). In
some cases, a guide can warn of danger, simply by telling that
a particular location doesn't "feel" right. Guides will often have
the Sense of Direction Edge and possibly also the Home
Ground Edge (see pp. 24 and 18, respectively, SRComp).
Guides can also be helpful when it comes to dealing with
the locals. They speak the language, but more importantly,
they're from around here. In the natives' eyes, if the guide has
chosen to work with these strangers, then maybe they aren't all
that bad after all. A guide can also help introduce merc char-
acters to other local contacts, if necessary.
Uses: Rural contact, can help with navigating an unknown area,
interacting with local residents, information and intelligence on
activity in a rural region.
Places to Meet: Local villages or towns in the region.
Similar Contacts and Connections: Smugglers, scouts, mercs,
tribal people, nomads.

NEW EQUIPMENT
The following gear can be found in the possession of mer-
cenaries around the globe. Though shadowrunners sometimes
make use of it, many of the munitions are too "heavy" for stan-
dard shadowrunning purposes.
Vehicle Weapons
Heavy Mortar: The heavy mortar is a heavier, vehicle-
mounted version of the M-12 Portable Mortar System (p. 26,
Cannon Companion). As with all mortars, the heavy mortar
lobs a 100 millimeter-caliber projectile at high arc; with its
extended range, heavy mortars are used almost exclusively in
indirect fire mode.
Heavy mortars have a Weapon Value of 4. Each CF of
ammunition storage holds 20 mortar shells. A heavy mortar
can fire a maximum of 1 round per Combat Turn, regardless of
the number of actions available to the firer.
Light Howitzer: The light howitzer is the lightest of
artillery cannons, with a caliber ranging between 90 and 110
millimeters. Light howitzers are used exclusively for indirect
fire support, but their relatively low fire arc gives them better
range than mortars.

Light howitzers have a Weapon Value of 6. Each CF of
ammunition storage holds 10 howitzer shells. At least 2 CF
must be dedicated to ammunition storage.
Ammunition and Explosives
The following ammunition types are available for both
heavy mortars and light howitzers. Shells are not interchange-
able between systems; they must be designated as either mor-
tar or howitzer shells when purchased.
Antipersonnel Shell: This fragmentation shell is very
effective against troops out in the open. Apply the rules for
flechette ammunition (p. 116, SR3) to this round.
Anti-vehicle Shell: This smart shell homes in on vehicles
and fires an explosively-formed penetrator when in proximity
of the vehicle. They use the anti-vehicular ammunition rules.
High Explosive Shell: This is a standard explosive shell,
designed for general mass destruction.
ICM Shell: The improved conventional munition (ICM)
mortar round dispenses small submunitions when above its tar-
get. When this round explodes, apply the same damage code
on all targets within a 20-meter radius of the impact point.
DP-ICM Shell: The dual-purpose improved conventional
munition (DP-ICM) is based on the ICM, except that it uses
shaped-charge submunitions effective against vehicles. As
with the ICM round, the DP-ICM inflicts the same damage
code on all targets within a 20-meter radius of impact.
Vehicles do not reduce the Power or Damage Level when
attacked by a DP-ICM round, but they do gain the benefit of
their full Armor rating.
Jammer Shell: The jammer shell doesn't contain explo-
sives, but instead carries a payload of jammers and ECM for
electronic warfare. The jammer shell can be set to jam standard
radio communications (see Jammers, p. 291, SR3), sensors (see
Electronic Countermeasures, p. 138, SR3), or rigger remote
control networks. Jammer shells have a Rating of 4 and a Flux
of 8. They affect a spherical area with a radius equal to 2D6
meters times the number of successes generated on the
Gunnery Test, plus 10 ([2D6 x successes] + 10); systems out-
side this radius are unaffected. Jammer shells affect all trans-
missions of its type, whether friend or foe.
Seeker Shell: Seeker shells are sophisticated rocket-like
devices capable of homing in on a target marked by a laser,
microwave or radar target designator. Seeker shells enable the
character using a mortar or howitzer to take advantage of tar-
get designators for indirect fire (see Indirect Fire, p. 99, Cannon
Companion). Every mortar or howitzer shell listed is also avail-
able as a seeker shell.
Solar Shell: The solar shell aids in night maneuvers by cre-
ating a bright white flash that burns for 5 minutes, making the
area brighter than full daylight and making it difficult for any-
one in the immediate vicinity to see.
When the mortar strikes, everyone looking in the direction
of impact suffers a +8 target number modifier for any vision-
required Success Tests (including combat). Reduce this modifi-
er by -1 per 10 meters from the point of impact; flare com-
pensation reduces the modifier by 2. This effect is reduced by
-2 per full Combat Turn.
The bright light produced by the round will negate all vis-
ibility modifiers for darkness out to a 100-meter radius, but
anyone looking directly towards it will suffer a +4 glare visibil-
ity modifier (+2 if the viewer has flare compensation). The
round will burn out after 5 minutes.
Smoke Shell: These rounds deploy a 30-meter radius
smoke cloud that lasts for 4 minutes. This smoke obscures
standard vision; apply vision modifiers to relevant tests (see p.
106, Cannon Companion, for smoke rules). The IR variant pro-
duces smoke with hot particles that obscure thermographic
vision as well.
Firearm Accessories
Ammunition Pouches: Ammunition pouches are weath-
er-durable pouches that can be easily attached or detached to
combat vests or equipment harnesses. Gamemasters may use
them to limit the amount of ammunition readily available to
characters. A pistol pouch holds two pistol or SMG clips, a rifle
pouch holds three rifle clips, while a shotgun pouch holds

twenty shotgun rounds. Each ammunition pouch takes up one
harness slot.
Combat Vest: A combat vest is a custom-designed vest
made for attaching equipment and ammunition pouches for
ready access. Gamemasters may use combat vests to limit the
amount of ammunition and equipment carried. Combat vests
possess twelve harness slots and may not be worn in conjunc-
tion with security or military grade armor.
Load-bearing Harness: A load-bearing harness consists
of a large belt and suspenders worn atop field gear.
Gamemasters may use harnesses to limit the amount of ammu-
nition and equipment carried. Load-bearing harnesses possess
eight harness slots and may not be worn in conjunction with
security or military grade armor.
Explosives
Bangalore Torpedo: A bangalore torpedo consists of ten
sections of explosives formed into a solid 1.5-meter cylinder.
Any and all sections may be screwed together to form a longer
length of detonation. This creates a lozenge-shaped impact
zone centered along the length of the torpedo. This is particu-
larly useful for bypassing barriers, by drilling a hole and sticking
the torpedo through to the other side.
Claymore Mine: A claymore mine is a fragmentation mine
that is so simple to use that it is standard issue amongst sol-
diers and mercs alike. A claymore mine primarily affects all tar-
gets within a 60-degree frontal arc. Reduce the Power of the
claymore against targets within the blast radius who are out-
side the 60-degree arc by half (round down).
Cratering Charges: A cratering charge consists of a tan-
dem explosive suspended on a tripod. When detonated, the
first charge drives the explosive into the ground. The second
charge detonates the buried charge, creating a large crater.
Used against roadways, it creates a crater with a diameter of 5
+ (1D6 + 2, round up) meters and a depth half the diameter.
Additionally, it tears up the ground in an additional radius
equal to half the crater's diameter around the crater's rim; treat
as uneven ground for movement purposes. Ground vehicles
attempting to drive over or around the crater must make a
Crash Test to avoid falling into the crater.
Detonation Cord: Detonation cord is a flexible fabric tube
filled with plastic explosives. Det cord is well-known for trans-
mitting explosive shockwaves very well, even faster than elec-
trical wire. If used as an explosive, detonation cord has a dam-
age code of 12S equidistant along its length.
Mine Detection Gear: Mine detection gear consists of
spectrographic and radiological analyzers configured to detect
explosives, particularly the plastic explosives commonly used
in mines. Mine detection gear uses the same rules as chem-
sniffers (p. 90, SRComp), but increase their rating by 1 when
trying to detect mines. Against all other explosives, reduce
their rating by 1.
Survival Equipment
Camouflage Nets: Camouflage nets protect vehicles,
encampments and other large objects or areas. People and
objects underneath a set up camouflage net receive a +4 mod-
ifier against Perception Tests, and a +2 Signature modifier
against sensors. Camouflage nets come in the shape of 10-
square meter diamonds. Setting up a camouflage net takes 5
minutes per diamond involved.
Camping Gear: Camping gear consists of tents, sleeping
bags, canteens, mess kits and other tools necessary for living
outdoors in relative comfort. Having adequate camping gear
on hand for all characters reduces the target number for
Survival Tests (see p. 106, Target: Wastelands).
Equipment Pouches: Equipment pouches consist of
weather-durable pouches that can be easily attached or

detached from combat vests or equipment harnesses.
Gamemasters may use them to limit the amount of equipment
readily available to characters. A small pouch contains approxi-
mately 5,000 cubic centimeters (about 100 ECU, or 0.04 CF),
while a large pouch holds approximately 12,500 cubic cen-
timeters (about 250 ECU, or 0.1 CF). A small pouch takes up one
harness slot, while a large pouch takes up two harness slots.
Field Rations: Field rations are a tremendous improve-
ment over the measly ration bars in a basic survival kit, since
they consist of complete, filling meals preserved in hermeti-
cally sealed bags. Additionally, field rations in the 2060s
incorporate their own integral heater pack, which ensures
that meals are always hot. Having adequate rations to feed all
characters reduces the target number for Survival Tests (see
p. 106, Target: Wastelands).
Ingenious characters may use the heater pack in a field
ration to create an improvised explosive. To do so, make a
Demolitions Test against a Target Number of 4. If successful,
the character creates a "bottle bomb" explosive, with a Power
equal to 3 plus the number of successes (maximum Power 10),
a base Damage Level of M, and a Power reduction of -1 per
half meter. This "bottle bomb" explosive may only be triggered
either by impact or by heat.
Military Rucksack: A military rucksack is a backpack espe-
cially designed for mercs and soldiers. Gamemasters may use
them to limit the amount of equipment readily available to
characters. A small rucksack holds approximately 15,000 cubic
centimeters (0.2 CF), while a large rucksack holds approxi-
mately 65,000 cubic centimeters (0.5 CF). Military rucksacks
employ a quick release mechanism that allow a character to
ditch it quickly; doing so requires only a Free Action.
Unslinging them normally requires a Complex Action.
Civilian versions are available without the quick release
mechanism and cost only half the listed amount.
Self-inflating Tent: A self-inflating tent is a single-person
pup tent equipped with a gas charge for self-inflation.
Additionally, it contains its own integral climate control unit,
good for 48 hours. A character may increase the duration by
making a Survival (4) Test. Each success increases the climate
control duration by 12 hours, for a maximum of 144 hours (6
days). A self-inflating tent counts as a full set of camping gear
for a Survival Test, and the Climate Control modifier applies as
long as the tent's climate control is functional.
NEW VEHICLES
The following military vehicles may find use in a merce-
nary setting or campaign.
BAE-Alvis Agincourt Mortar Carrier
Under Britain's regimental modernization program in
2058, the Ministry of Defense contracted BAE to build a new
mortar carrier for their armored and mechanized infantry regi-
ments. In response, BAE's Alvis subsidiary unveiled the
Agincourt, one of the first few armored vehicles to incorporate
an electric fuel cell engine.

Eurocopter Tiger
The German and French Tiger, long since the typical
European combat helicopter, has begun to show its age. Its
outmoded design has seen it phased out of all but a few
armies. The approximately 1,800 models from the last series
(2007/A4, built from 2027 to 2034), however, are still flight
capable and have made their way onto the open market. Most
are in use with corporate troops that are limited by small bud-
get allocations.

some impressive trial runs, the BMV-1 had exposed thrust vec-
toring ports, making them notoriously easy to detect and tar-
get on aerial scanners, and resulting in heavy casualties
amongst Russia's airborne forces. The BMV-2 corrected most of
the BMV-1's fatal flaws and later went on to serve in the Russian
military until the 2050s. Though retired from active service
amongst the Russian military, the BMV-2 can still be found
among many merc forces and Third World governments
around the world.

most of the Hellhound's secondary armament in favor of eight
Vogeljäger SAMs. Ruhrmetall retained the main gun, the

assault tank from Ruhrmetall. Though the base design originat-
ed during the Euro-Wars, even today the Keiler is still a worthy
segment of ground forces. Standard armament includes a
medium railgun and choice of combat laser or HVAR mounted
in a micro-turret atop the main turret. ECM and other combat
electronics are available at extra charge.

It never ceases to amuse me that the same corps that find it so necessary to support and uti-
lize a thriving shadowrunner subculture are also consistently devising ways to deter shad-
owrunners-and making a profit off it, of course. It's been a while since we here on
Shadowland have taken a look at the latest schemes and tech the corporate security boys
have prepared for us. So when this 2063 catalogue from that Motor City security firm found its
way into my mailbox. it was a natural choice for this SOTA update. A lot of this is old news, but a
refresher course never hurts, and there's enough new data to pay attention to-the state of the
art waits for no one in the shadows. It's oriented toward the corporate management crowd and
gated community association set, of course, so flip on your corpspeak filters.
I've thrown in two little somethings after the catalogue to balance the perspective. First is a
piece from Grey Knight, an Ares colonel who doesn't mind giving us plain talk on how security
specialists like himself pull all of these security devices into a working system. Second is an exposé
on the tricks and methods that B&E experts use to bypass all of this drek and get the goods any-
way.

CORPORATE SECURITY
Welcome to Knight Errant's Security Catalogue, 2063! In the ever-evolving world of strate-
gic asset protection, corporate managers must keep pace with advances in security in order to
keep unauthorized visitors to a minimum. Criminals slow down for no one, but Knight Errant is
always one step ahead of the technology curve, providing our customers with the very latest in
intrusion prevention and detection technology. The new year brings some exciting new prod-
ucts in our Barrier, Sensor and CCSS Infrastructure product categories. Also this year, we offer
expanded Integration Services to advise our customers how to construct the security plan that
fits your budget and needs, in addition to training your staff and administration in security pro-
cedures. Knight Errant still offers the highest quality staffing solutions to provide you with all of
your security needs!
· Ugh. I know half of you are probably asleep already, but did
anyone catch that bit about fitting your budget? Aside from
metahuman sloppiness, that's the weak link in the corpsec
defense. Most corps don't have wads of cred to blow on nova
electronics and gadgetry, much less maintain it all regularly or
update it to counteract the latest shadowrunner tricks. The bot-
tom line counts, chummer. On the flip side, most of the places
that we really, really want to get into will splurge for the big, nasty,
shadowrunner-killa systems. It's never easy, eh?
· Murphy
PHYSICAL SECURITY
The foundation to every good security system is construc-
tion that helps prevent criminal elements from accessing your
facility. No single system alone can thwart unwanted intrusions,
but when combined with Knight Errant's expertise in installation
and training, your facility can deter most, if not all, criminals
from their illegal aspirations. Perimeter fencing, exterior and
interior lighting, specialized exterior and interior wall construc-
tion, security doors and a variety of locking mechanisms meld
efficiently to create a barrier to both the criminal element and
wayward employees.
Landscaping
Your security plan should take into account the local geog-
raphy outside your facility. If Nature fails to provide defensive
measures, Knight Errant can. Space permitting, lakes, tank traps,
and artificial hills and gullies can be added to keep intruders from
getting close. These features can be used to conceal gun ports,
drones, sensors, tiger-pits and tripwires. Unrestricted clear-fire
zones can also be constructed for increased access control.
Fencing
The first segment of Knight Errant's security plan is a good
perimeter. Chain link fences provide an optimum price-perfor-
mance point for perimeter defense in a variety of roles. The abil-
ity to see through the chain link fence to the area beyond your
facility is a good deterrent for mischief-makers, allowing security
to keep an eye on anyone approaching the facility.
Knight Errant fencing is manufactured from premium high-
quality alloy or electrically conducting densiplast. The spacing
between links is optimized to prevent even slighter metahumans
from using the links as footholds. Standard fencing stands 3.5
meters tall, and we recommend a bottom clearance of no more
than 2 centimeters from the ground. In particularly sensitive
areas, the bottom of the fence should be buried underground to
impede both wildlife and criminals, with at least 3 meters
remaining above ground level to impede taller metahumans
from easily climbing over the top. Culverts are added to prevent
washout channels from developing underneath the fence.
Extra defensive features can be applied to Knight Errant
fencing, such as concertina or barbed wire. Attached to the top
of the fence at a 45-degree angle away from the facility to be
protected, "razorwire" provides a significant deterrent to anyone
attempting to climb over the fence. Monomolecular wire can
also be employed at high-threat areas as a more effective deter-
rent to intrusion. All wire can also be electrified, and Knight
Errant will even hook it up to a separate power line from the
fence in case saboteurs disable the line servicing the fence itself.
Low power levels serve as an adequate warning, but lethal volt-
age should be used with care due to legal concerns. Finally,
proximity tripwires can be applied to detect bypass attempts
and trigger active security measures.
· Monowire is a "deterrent?" Is that corpspeak for "No fraggin'
hands left?"
. Left Hand Lucky
· Watch that electric wire-some corps use a switchable volt-
age. It's low when you first cross the fence, easily overcome with
a rubber mat. But on the way out, after you've tripped an alarm
or three, it'll fry you.
· Highwire
Walls
Knight Errant offers a wide selection of exterior walls, from
inexpensive plasticrete to intermediate concrete to the expen-
sive steel-reinforced concrete. Exterior walls can be constructed
with varying thickness to meet your specific needs, up to and
including defense against terrorist car-bomb attacks. Concentric
walls with staggered entry points are suggested for greater
security.
· Ares Industrial sells plasticrete under the Plascrete brand name.
There are several knock-off versions, mostly from PacRim compa-
nies, which are much easier to climb or demolish. Some cheaper
plasticrete will actually dissolve if sprayed with the right solvents,
just like Plastisteel-7.
· AI
. Staggered entry points means no ramming through the high
security gates, and no easy burn-rubber-at-high-speed escapes.
And they're not kidding about defending against explosives-KE
uses angled wall bases and even blast plating in the real high-
end stuff. Nothing ruins your day faster than the shockwave from
a few kilos of shaped C-12 being blasted right back at you.
· Drive-By
. Luckily, employees tend to have reservations about working in
environments that resemble prisons, so a lot of corps skimp in this
area. But the smart ones just pretty it all up with flowers and sculp-
ture and scenic landscaping.
· Midnight Gardener
Interior wall construction does not need to conform to the
same standard as exterior walls. Knight Errant utilizes 1 cen-
timeter ballistic weave lined wallboards that minimize collateral
damage from a firearms violation. This provides excellent pro-
tection to both equipment and personnel.
· Note which one comes first.
· Seenik
· Hey, at least they're honest. Rescan the stats on that wallboard,
though. Add in both sides of the wall and that's 2cm of ballistic
weave plus however many centimeters of insulation, pipes, duct-
work and wiring. It might as well be made of plasticrete for all the
effect bullets will have on it.
· AI
Lighting
Proper exterior illumination is an often overlooked but
essential part of security. Knight Errant offers six styles of light-
ing, covering a range of tasks and areas of the light spectrum.
. Lights? What's the point of this junk?
· Farkman
· The second rule of not being seen is knowing how others can
see you. How a corp lights up that research lab will influence how
you disguise your entry.
· Highwire
All of the following styles come in handheld, portable flood-
light and fixed floodlight assemblies. Some are also available in
weapon-mounted varieties.
Polis™ Incandescent: Perfect for task and ornamental
lighting.
Citizen™ Fluorescent: Energy-efficient corporate and busi-
ness lighting.
Vibrance™ Gas-Discharge: Long-term, high-wattage exte-
rior lighting.
Daylight™ Halogen-Quartz: Premiere high-wattage light-
ing for both indoors and out.
Nightshot™ Active Infrared: Unobtrusive security lighting
for augmented vision and sensors.
Spectra™ Ultraviolet: Forensic and security lighting, perfect
for catching dye-marked trespassers and locating fingerprints
and biological evidence.
· Watch out for those Daylight lamps. Some sadistic fragger
had one of these concealed in a room next to the access
panel I was cracking. When a sensor was tripped (hey, I didn't
do it), this little slitch came on and blinded me despite my flare-
comps. Good thing my buddy dragged me out; I was still see-
ing spots a week later.
· 3i Blind
· Active infrared lights work both ways. Trolls and dwarfs will see
the place like daylight. And what sammie worth his salt doesn't
have a thermo package with his cybereyes?
· Highwire
· Want to hear a neat trick? Infrared works on a different part of
the spectrum, right? Well it just so happens that certain surfaces
that aren't reflective to normal vision are reflective on the
infrared spectrum, so they work like a mirror-but only if you have
thermographic vision. I found this out when we hit a facility that
had lined every corner with infrared-reflective boarding. All of the
guards had thermo, so they could see us coming from around
the corner. Luckily, we had a troll in our team who picked up on
this real fast and used it to her own advantage.
· Angler
Exterior lighting should be placed within the perimeter of
the facility, targeted away to give security advance warning of
potential intruders. Properly placed exterior lighting can deter
intruders from approaching restricted areas.
Lighting Switches
Security lighting can be controlled with several mecha-
nisms: photoelectric, timer switches, electronically operated or
manual switches. Area effect lighting is best enabled via photo-
electric switches, which will turn them on when the ambient
light reaches a certain level. This provides some of the more
powerful lamps with the long warm-up time they need.
Timed switches can also be utilized on exterior lighting but
suffer the disadvantage of susceptibility to tampering via control
circuits and/or power loss. These switches are best utilized in
conjunction with more discreet lighting technology around areas
that have a regular schedule of activity, such as a loading dock
illuminated by a timed incandescent lamp for delivery hours and
continuously lit by an active-infrared lamp. Electronically operat-
ed switches can be controlled either via a secured Matrix con-
nection or by the recommended closed-circuit simsense system
network.
Electronic switches are flexible, able to be pre-programmed
to activate on certain conditions or activated on command by
security, but can be subverted by hostile deckers or riggers.
Electronic switches are best utilized on emergency lights or to
indicate a security violation, and can be tripped automatically or
by remote security command. Manual switches are the most vul-
nerable to tampering; they require the most intervention to acti-
vate and are best used on task-specific lighting, such as guard-
operated floodlights, indoor lighting and handheld lamps.
. You can deck electronic and timed switches that are
hooked into the Matrix. Of course, the real trick is finding which
host has them slaved to it. Not all switches are connected to
the public grid.
· Highwire
Windows
Windows are a common security flaw that tend to draw
those bent on mischief. Knight Errant solves this problem by
securing windows and their frames with alarms and damage-
resistant materials.
In addition to ballistic and armored glass, polycarbonate
glazing is also available to reinforce windows. All glass varieties
crumble to prevent injuries from flying shards and can be outfit-
ted with wire mesh to hold the glass together even if the win-
dows is broken. All glass windows can be one-way coated
(opaque to the outside) to prevent the magical targeting of per-
sonnel inside your facility
Knight Errant also offers transparent polymer and laminated
polymer window designs that offer the breaking resistance and
stopping power of armored glass with a lighter weight.
Photovoltaic densiplast is also an option, so that windows can
easily be switched from transparent to opaque.
Doors
While a room with no access points would be completely
secure, employees need physical access to places that must be
secured with other means. Knight Errant offers a variety of secu-
rity doors to fit your needs. Security doors are installed to pro-
tect key rooms and at key junction-points to compartmentalize a
facility during a security breach.
All exterior access doors are constructed to open inward, to
protect the hinges from being compromised and the door
removed. Emergency egress doors are weighted and balanced
to open with minimal effort, and are also wired to the security
system to warn of unauthorized access. All secured doors are
constructed of solid, high-quality stainless steel with a single-
body stainless 16 gauge steel frame.
"Pocket door" construction is also available, where the door
retracts into the body of the wall instead of swinging in or out.
These doors are ideal for laboratory environments where floor
space is at a premium.
Transparent, laminated, bullet-resistant polymer can also be
applied to doors, enhancing your protective needs. We also offer
photovoltaic densiplast so a door can go from opaque in any
number of colors to transparent.
HVAC
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
provide essential environmental controls, but also pose a serious
security hole. To prevent criminal cockroaches in the ductwork,
all vents should be too small to allow access to the system.
Knight Errant's Airwall™ system can be installed within ductwork
to sterilize the air flow with microbe-killing UV light, automati-
cally preventing the spread of airborne pathogens.
When attached to a CCSS network, an HVAC system can
automatically be blocked off in certain places to prevent the
spread of incapacitating gases used to disable intruders.
Circulation fans can be controlled via CCSS to provide precise cli-
mate control to multiple independent rooms.
· Cockroaches, nice. It just makes your day to know what the
corps think of you. Corp sentiment aside, there are still entry
points that a body can fit into. Main ventilation shafts in large
buildings can even fit some orks. Just watch out for those circu-
lation fans.

TECHNICAL SECURITY
Sensor devices are the eyes and ears of any security system.
No security system is complete without integrating the latest
advances in security technologies. Switch alarms involve passive
detection of movement through an area. Area sensors detect
changes in the state of an enclosed space. Biometric Recognition
Technology measures human features to detect unauthorized
persons. Embedded Sensor Technology is the very latest in secu-
rity technology, using laminated piezo-electric composites and
hot new nanotechnology to make the walls your sensors. High-
visibility fake sensor devices can also be used to distract mal-
contents from the true security systems.
Switch Alarms
Switch alarms are a general class of unobtrusive, passive
sensors, designed to detect intruders and trigger alerts without
the intruder's knowledge. Knight Errant offers a complete
selection of alarms, including the time-tested entry-point alarm
circuit, capacitance "proximity" wire, pressure pads and laser
trip beams. Intruder alarms can be connected to traditional
alarm systems, warning klaxons or a CCSS system for truly
silent alarm protection.
Window and door alarm circuits consist of a conductive
metal or polymer embedded in the glass of a window or frame
of a door. When the window or door is closed, the circuit is
active. Once the window or door is opened, the circuit is cut,
triggering an alarm condition.
· Circuit alarms are cake to crack. Slip a bit of foil across the con-
tacts, use a shim of conducting metal, whatever it takes. All you
need to do is keep the contacts together long enough to get in
and close it behind you. You do close doors and windows behind
you, don't you?
· Highwire
Capacitance wire, also known as proximity wire, detects the
electrical charge of a metahuman body. Specially calibrated cir-
cuits link the two ends of the wire. When a metahuman enters
the range of the wire, the electrical charge of the trespasser's
body induces a change in the current across the wire, triggering
an alarm. These are often wired into perimeter fences to trigger
cameras or active security measures.
Pressure mesh/pads are precisely calibrated air bladders
completely hidden under or within tile, carpeting or other floor-
ing. When activated, the system senses the weight of a metahu-
man walking on top of it. The weight displaces the air in the blad-
der and triggers the alarm, also reporting the weight of the indi-
vidual(s). Similar versions use piezo-electrical tiles or metal con-
tact strips rather than air bladders.
· This weight measurement aspect can trip you up. We once
scoped a target site and determined that they had guard dogs
roaming the halls. Ok, we figured that meant all we had to do
was take out the pups. They wouldn't have any tripwires to worry
about, since the dogs would set them off, right? Wrong. The dogs
were all under 50 kilos, so the trip pad ignored them. But when
we waltzed in, each easily over 75 kilos, we set the fraggin' alarm
off.
· Daisy
Laser trip beams utilize directed laser light to complete a
circuit. When an intruder interrupts the circuit, an alarm is trig-
gered. Knight Errant sells only the highest-quality, modern laser
trip beam systems, each designed to measure the power of the
laser beam across its path. If the level drops below a certain
threshold, such as would occur if a criminal redirects the beam,
an alarm is triggered. These laser beam systems also work only
on certain wavelengths; any introduction of wavelengths outside
the approved set will trigger an alarm.
· Watch out for the "laser mazes," folks. Every bounce is part of
the system, so if the beam doesn't hit each and every mirror, the
alarm goes off. Nothing's worse than setting up an elaborate mir-
ror system, keeping the length exactly right, only to have the
alarm go off anyway.
· Highwire
Area Sensors
Area sensors cover entire rooms by their nature, monitoring
state changes in a sealed environment: motion, temperature,
sound/vibration or air pressure. Knight Errant recommends area
sensors as ideal in laboratories and containment facilities where
no employees are present; otherwise they are thrown off by the
presence of authorized individuals.
Motion sensors use infrared technology to detect changes
in the ambient temperature of a room. Motion detectors do not
have the resolution to form a visual image, but they will pick up
any movement in their field of view. They are best combined
with a temperature sensor so that enterprising criminals cannot
override your heating system to raise the ambient temperature
of a room beyond the sensor range of the motion detector,
which would blind it.
· Remember, the H in HVAC stands for "heating." If you can gain
control of that, you can control those temperature settings.
· Mother
Sound sensors utilize extremely sensitive microphones
to detect vibrations. They can be programmed to ignore
sounds like a ringing telecom, gunfire, thunder and earth-
quakes. For maximum efficiency and to avoid false alarms,
they should be monitored via CCSS system by a Knight Errant
trained security rigger.
· Think about these for a second. Sure, it can be programmed to
ignore gunfire, but it doesn't say that it will ignore all gunfire. Say,
for example, all security all carries the same kind of weapon, and
these little buggers will ignore only that kind. You go shooting your
favorite Warhawk in a place that issues Brownings, and you're

Air pressure sensors monitor barometric changes in a
closed environment. This kind of sensor is most efficient in a lab-
oratory environment where certain conditions have to be main-
tained and the door is not opened often. This is an excellent sen-
sor to maintain the integrity of a sealed area.
· Ignore for a moment how hard these systems seem to be to
crack. If you can measure how much air is supposed to flow
through the room from the HVAC system, you can slip in through
the ductwork. It's a dirty, smelly, cramped business, but if it's the
only way, get crawling.
· Highwire
Pheromone scanners detect the pheromones secreted from
metahuman glands by sampling the air. Criminals with
pheromone-boosting augmentations will get quite a surprise
when they try to infiltrate a facility that uses these unobtrusive
biometric scanners!
· Oh, they are so not kidding here. We didn't even see the slag-
ging sensor when cracking open a research lab. Our decker's
got the maglock popped open, I'm watching the hall and our
elven sammie is ready to kick open the door. Only problem is he
has tailored pheromones and they're pumping out enough
"scent" or whatever to light this sensor up like a Christmas tree.
Next thing I know, drones are dropping from the ceiling and I hear
the pitter-patter of security feet. A real close one.
· Drowned Rat
· They've been trying to incorporate ways to use pheromone
scanners for biometric access control, but the systems aren't
sophisticated enough yet to identify individual users-unless they
are used in conjunction with tailored pheromones or scent
glands, but that's an expensive modification to force your
employees to get.

Cameras and Visual Sensors
Standard security cameras can see across multiple spec-
tra of light. They range in size from the obvious full-sized
model (an intruder deterrent due to its visibility) to concealed
pinhole cameras.
Infrared sensors have been used since the last century to
detect body heat. Police departments were the first to adopt
widespread use of infrared technology in locating criminals.
Knight Errant now brings to you a mature infrared product that
will see through darkness, available in a variety of styles. Passive
infrared sensors can produce an image in black and white, with
white signifying hot spots. Thermographic sensors can overlay a
colored heat gradient to a standard infrared display, providing
an extra level of heat differentiation.
· Fires and other large heat sources can drown out other heat
signatures. Of course, blazing infernos tend to attract attention,
so I don't recommend them as appropriate "distractions" unless
your goal is collateral damage.
· Poker
Low-light, or light amplification, sensors take ambient light
and electronically increase it to produce an image. Low-light
sensors have a distinctive green hue to them.
· Bright lights cause glare on low-light sensors, and exceptional
spikes can burn out the sensitive optics.
Ultraviolet sensors pick up light beyond the range of visible
light, less than 400 nanometers. Only the near ultraviolet spec-
trum is of any use to security planners; the farther ranges of the
spectrum require too much energy and have only minimal ben-
efits in observing intruders. UV sensors are commonly used to
locate marker dyes and movement in conjunction with FAB astral
Intruder detection systems.
Ultrasound
Ultrasound, while not a light-based sensor, fills a similar role
in security planning. Ultrasonic pulses detect movement within
its operational range and sophisticated dedicated processing
units translate the reflected sound into a wireframe model of the
movement. Ultrasonics are not fooled by spells that render crim-
inals invisible to light-based sensors.
· Some of those ultrasonic sensors can do more than track you.
Our team was prowling through a research facility in never-you-
mind when one of those bad boys went from "track" to "disable."
It flooded the room with enough noise that our adept was on the
floor clutching his head. Me? I got to see my breakfast again in
an unpleasant fashion. Not what I'd call an elegant security sys-
tem, but we did go home empty-handed.

Weapon and Control Scanners
Personnel sensors are designed to scan people entering
your facility in an unobtrusive manner and alert security person-
nel to contraband equipment and modifications.
Magnetic Anomaly Detector (MAD) systems have been in
service for decades and are quite capable of detecting even the
smallest of weapons. MAD systems can easily be installed in
doorways or arches, with the archetypal freestanding archway
still employed for psychological purposes. The MAD unit creates
an electromagnetic field; passing a firearm or other ferromag-
netic material through it creates an electrical charge. The induc-
tance and resistance of the scanned object is compared to metic-
ulously created files on common and exotic weapons and items,
providing security with a match. Hand-operated scanners can
also be employed to provide close inspection of a person should
a full unit not provide the resolution required.
· Lots of runners forget that their nice new ceramic gun has a lot
of metal in it. Specifically, in the bullets. Tip to the newbies: use
caseless Hi-C densiplast cartridges in that ceramic gun.
· Faisal
Chemical sniffers sample the air in order to detect the
particles given off by the nitrogen-rich propellants in firearm
cartridges and explosives. The volatile nature of a criminal's
weapons works against him, and the chemsniffer units can be
mounted unobtrusively in doorways just like a MAD unit. A
handheld unit is also available for point inspection of people
and items.
· Plastic baggies-they're not just for your novacoke stash any
more!
· Redeye
· Wiseacre narcotics references aside, hermetically sealing your
weapons and ammunition in plastic isn't a bad way to avoid
chemsniffers. But eventually you will have to remove the bags in
order to use them, and that means any wandering chemsniffer
will scream.
· Highwire
. Be careful about wandering through one of these right after
a firefight. Even if you've ditched the shooters, your hands and
arms will be caked with residue from all the lead you forceful-
ly propelled. The chemsniffer may pick up on that, and the
cops have a chemical dropper that will reveal the residue on
your skin. You may not have any contraband, but they'll hold
you for questioning and may try to connect you to any unex-
plained incidents.
· Grip
Cyberware scanners utilize a dual-scan technology to pene-
trate the metahuman body. Ultrasonic and magnetic resonance
scanning combine to see both soft tissue and dense structures
within the body, revealing all but the most advanced cybernet-
ics. Advanced processors match the patterns revealed by the
scanner to a database of modifications, classifying the threat
level for security personnel. Extensive modifications are not
always illegal, even under corporate bylaws, so Knight Errant can
offer its identity and permit matching service to authenticate
registered cybernetics.
· "Identity and permit matching service?" Since when do KE and
the Star play nice-nice together?
· Razor Rick
· Since there was profit in it. Lone Star charges a per-access fee
and Knight Errant turns around and charges their customers a
higher per-access fee. It's all nice and cozy, so don't get too
cocky. Cross the Star and Knight Errant might just know all about
you already.
· X-Star
. Luckily, current cyberware scanners cannot detect bioware,
but I hear Knight Errant (and others) is working towards a scanner
that will do just that.
· Biomatic
Maglocks
Locking mechanisms are the backbone of all security sys-
tems. Modern maglocks will resist almost any attempt to force
them open by physical means and have become the standard for
high security needs. Maglocks can be combined with any num-
ber of keying mechanisms, from biometric sensors to the latest
in physical and electronic key technology.
Maglocks use powerful electromagnets to secure a strike
plate. The advantage of this system is both the incredible power
with which maglocks attach and that they can be completely
electronically controlled and monitored.
· The disadvantage is that they are dependent on power to
operate. Though a power loss will not cause maglocks to auto-
matically open, it will render them inoperable. The magnet locks
inside either the frame or door, just like an old-style deadbolt. So
cutting the power won't get you in, but it keeps security con-
tained while you force your way through the door.
. Tony Two-Chins
All basic maglocks come with either magnetic keycard
access or proximity card access, both of which can be pro-
grammed via a master security station. Swipe cards and data-
jack-accessed memory strings can also be used as keys.
Key Locks
In 1861, Linus Yale Jr. invented the pin-tumbler lock, which
reigned supreme as the most pick-resistant lock available. Over
two hundred years later, modern pin-tumbler locks are a hybrid
dimple-cylinder design, utilizing the full 360 degrees of the
cylinder's surface with an arbitrary number of pins. Home secu-
rity cylinder-pin locks use five to ten pin positions, whereas secu-
rity locks can employ dozens of pins.
· If you're not an expert lock picker, try getting your paws on an
actual key for a sec or two (through subterfuge, sleight of hand,
or however you can). Make an imprint of the key in a wax mold
case, and use that imprint to create a copy. Viola, you're in.
· Charlie
An advanced feature of cylinder-pin locks is the ability to
accept a transponder in the tip of the key. When inserted into the
lock, the lock reads the transponder, allowing the key to be rotat-
ed and the pins activated.
· These can still be a problem, even with auto-pickers. Knight
Errant has some nice toys to pick these locks with, but good luck
in getting your hands on them.
· Highwire
Biometric Recognition Systems
Biometric recognition technology uses the metahuman
body as the key to open locks. When paired with maglocks,
biometrics provide the state-of-the-art in lock technology.
Biometric systems read certain characteristics from a metahuman
body and match them against an electronic database of autho-
rized users in order to grant or deny access. Common identifica-
tion mechanisms are fingerprints, palm prints, voiceprint and
retinal prints.
Fingerprint and palm print biometric scans work on similar
principles, scaled to either a single metahuman digit or the entire
hand. Modern finger/palm print scanners not only take a high-
resolution image of the finger/hand, but also measure the elec-
trical properties of the biological sample, verifying that the user
is indeed alive. No longer can criminals mutilate your employees
as an excuse to bypass your security.
Voiceprint analysis is an even more sophisticated method of
biometric recognition. The characteristics of the authorized
employee's voice will be measured against an encrypted bench-
mark. Voice-stress analysis and keywords pre-programmed into
the system can also determine if the employee is being coerced
Into providing his or her voice.
· If you're going to supply a recording of a voice, make sure it's
both high quality and your speaker has enough bass. Nothing's
more embarrassing than hitting "play" and hearing a tinny ver-
sion of the mark's voice come out. I've never been happier to do
remote work than when something like that happens. Don't
skimp on the recording equipment if you have to break a voice-
print scanner. Money saved can get you dead.
· Kan Opener
Facial recognition is another mature biometric scanning
technology. Developed in the late twentieth century, facial
recognition was widely used to match faces of known criminals
at sporting arenas and other high-profile terrorist targets with a
massive public presence. The advantage of facial recognition is
that it is completely non-intrusive; the user simply stands facing
the sensor as it renders an image of the facial structure using a
harmless laser. The resulting three-dimensional map. is com-
pared against the authorized user database, granting or denying
access as appropriate. More advanced scanners use thermo-
graphics to scan heat patterns under the skin or ultrasound to
map the facial bones and teeth.
· Facial scans were a joke when they were first introduced, pro-
ducing loads of false negatives and false positives and consis-
tently missing the people they were supposed to catch. Today
the tech has improved, but it's still lousy and not worth the price.
I guess it makes the straights feel safer, though.
· Clyde
Retinal scans are one of the most tested and secure bio-
metric scans available. Painless and quick, a laser scans the reti-
na, providing an accurate match to a known profile. Temperature
sensors around the scanner can determine if the eye has been
removed from its owner. Cybernetic retinal duplication is not
only highly illegal in most nations, but it is also imperfect and
detectable by Knight Errant's proven scanning systems.
· Yeah, sure. And they work great against nanite retinal tailors
too. (Snicker.)
· Conjunctivitis
Knight Errant's research and development department is
pleased to announce new advances in biometric scanning for our
customers, pushing the state of the art in biological recognition
systems to new levels. Knight Errant now offers three new bio-
metric technologies: pheromone scanners, DNA/cellular scan-
ners and breath scanners.
Cellular and DNA biometric recognition examines the
genetic material of a user. A small sample is taken after a palm
print scanner verifies that the user is alive and matches a base-
line biometric print. Cellular scans match the major histocompat-
ibility complex, the cellular fingerprint found on the sample
extracted via thumb pinprick. DNA scanning takes longer but is
much more comprehensive, taking several minutes to match the
sampled DNA to a database of authorized personnel. These
scanners can be made to look exactly like a plain palm print scan-
ner so that criminals will not know their DNA will be collected.
This can prove invaluable for later forensic investigation.
· Cellular scans don't actually decode your DNA. Instead, it
examines the "fingerprint" on the exterior of cells. This is more
unique than a finger or palm and less time-consuming than full
DNA checks.
· Doc X
· Even if you deck their records to get your own DNA on the
authorized list, you can be sure that the corp has already made
a backup or two. You can always try to intercept the authoriza-
tion request real-time, but I seriously doubt any corp putting cel-
lular scans on a door will use weak Matrix security on the autho-
rization database.
· Kan Opener
Breath biometric recognition measures cellular material
exhaled from the person into a specially calibrated membrane
sensor. Sampling the aerosolized cellular material in the vapor
from a hard exhale, the breath sensor filters out extraneous
material, such as prior meals and stray bacteria or viruses. The
sensing membrane is automatically cleansed after each use with
a pulse of ultraviolet light.
· Frag. I knew It. They can tell what you had for lunch.
· Silent Sam
. How useful is this, actually? There can't be too much
"aerosolized cellular material" in your breath. Pathogen transmis-
sion requires a vector, usually mucus coughed up from the lungs.
And gastro-intestinal "fumes" aren't going to provide enough
uniqueness for any kind of identification, especially since they
vary with what you had for lunch (thanks, Sam).
· PhDee
· Never mind that, all you need is a coffee mug that your autho-
rized user recently used. Grab the epithelial cells from it, replicate
some DNA with a portable microPCR, add to aerosol pump and
spray at sensor. Voila!

Embedded Sensor Technology
Advances in piezo-electrical composite materials have
brought about a revolution in security design. The creation of
embedded sensor, or "smart wall," technology allows unparal-
leled flexibility in design and execution of security monitoring.
Smart walls can load several different sensor technologies in
virtually limitless configurations. Utilizing the latest in nan-
otechnology to shrink down sensor size, Knight Errant offers
motion, air pressure, chemsniffer, pheromone and pressure
pad sensors. Nanotechnology removes the need for large
macrotech sensors, distributing the entire sensor across the
piezo-electrical composite.
· This gives me serious willies.
· Donjon
. You're not the only one. I keep thinking back to old runs and
wondering if this is the reason some of them went south for no
apparent reason.
· Highwire
The nanotech versions of these sensors differ from their
macrotech cousins. Lacking the large heat-sensing "eyes" of
normal motion sensors, the nanotech version utilizes a brand-
new capacitance-infrared hybrid. The nanotech air pressure
sensors utilize a sensitive nanotech membrane sandwiched
inside a piezo-electrical mesh; when the air pressure in the
room suddenly drops or increases, the membrane will distort,
causing an electrical charge to be generated in the mesh.
Chemsniffer sensors are actually small nanomachines spread
across a smart wall that sample the air for the same volatile
chemicals as the macrotech chemsniffer does. Pheromone sen-
sors embedded in piezo-electrical walls remain functionally
similar to their normal counterparts, incorporating minimal
amounts of nanotechnology to reduce the depth of the sensor.
Pressure pad sensors are embedded in the floor, like their
macrotech cousins. Since they can be ultra-thin, however, nan-
otech trip pads can be embedded in nearly any kind of floor-
ing, from metal to simulated wood.
. Now there's no doubt in my mind. Donjon, remember the
Whitehall facility?
· Highwire
. Now that was a freakshow. Not a single visible security device,
and we looked both before we went and while we were there.
And yet, security seemed to be all over us like stink on drek. They
definitely had some of those smart walls in there. We were lucky
to get out alive.
· Donjon
· Agreed. Time to get to the docs to check and see if they
tagged us.
· Highwire
Embedded sensor technology is designed for a closed-circuit
simsense system; normal displays cannot handle the amount of
information and degree of control that the system requires. These
systems require a significant amount of training and infrastructure
investment. The top of the line does carry a high price tag, but
also brings exceptionally high quality of security coverage!
. Fortunately, being reliant on CCSS gives this tech some serious
drawbacks. There are many ways to compromise a CCSS system,
and if the rigger can't sense the alarms, then no one's the wiser
about your presence.
· Kan Opener
Containment and Neutralization
In the event that your security is compromised, the first pri-
ority is to contain and/or neutralize any intruders and potential
threats. Knight Errant presents a range of products to detain,
incapacitate or otherwise handle intruders.
Doors, windows and other access points can be fitted with
steel or ballistic-polymer shutters that slide down and lock into
place when an alarm is triggered. Likewise, strategically-placed
gates can be deployed to trap intruders within an area where they
can do no harm. Other restrictive measures, such as laser or
monowire mazes, can also be triggered for detention. These
defenses stay in place until a security override command is
issued.
To neutralize active intruders, gas delivery systems can
shunt knockout gas into the compromised area, incapacitating
the criminals without causing collateral damage. The area can
then be ventilated and opened so security can arrest the inter-
lopers. Net guns and taser systems are also an option.
For extreme cases, gun ports capable of utilizing an assort-
ment of weaponry can be strategically positioned within walls,
landscaping or other features. Optimal placement will ensure
that intruders do not spot these ports in advance and that the
guns can sweep across a wide field of fire and eliminate multiple
targets at once.
· Watch out for those ceiling ports. Too many runners forget to
look up!

CCSS INFRASTRUCTURE
The glue that holds modern security systems together is
a closed-circuit simsense system. Adapted from the vehicle
Interface, rigger protocols were extended to cover building
fixtures. Managing all of this data is no easy task, but fortu-
nately Knight Errant has the gear to make all of your systems
function as one. Interconnects are the nuts and bolts that link
a CCSS system together.
Junction Switches
Junction switches serve to connect CCSS fiberoptic lines
together to form high-density fiber "trunks." Every device tied
Into the CCSS network does so through fiberoptic cable. In
order to maximize system bandwidth, Knight Errant offers its
Constellation line of CCSS junction switches. Available across all
price ranges, the Constellation line offers a number of configu-
rations for the bandwidth needs of your network.
The Constellation-IV switch offers a maximum of sixty-four
fiber connections, with two dedicated "uplink" ports to connect
either to another junction switch or a master access point. The
midrange Constellation-III switch offers thirty-two ports and a
single uplink port. For value-mindful customers, the
Constellation-Il switch offers sixteen ports, allowing for fifteen
device connections and one uplink to either a switch or master
access point.
The Constellation line of switches provides the ultimate in
expandability and redundancy. All models offer redundant
power supplies and processors, both of which are hot swap-
pable-meaning less downtime for your network! On-the-fly
firmware updates mean your system never misses a beat and
always stays up to date.
Routers
The Hermes line of CCSS routers is a new addition to Knight
Errant's CCSS lineup. Taking a cue from the advances in recent
cybernetics, Hermes routers create a composite CCSS signal
from several CCSS-enabled security devices. Combining several
security cameras, each sensitive to different wavelengths of
light, can create a CCSS picture visible across the entire light
spectrum. Not limited to just cameras, the Hermes line is fully
programmable, allowing security planners to decide how much
of each "channel" to display at will. They may also send custom
alerts to the CCSS operator based on interlinked events, such as
an air pressure drop combined with a spike in temperature.
The programmability features of Hermes CCSS routers are
accessible via a Kronos master access point. Router code can also
be written on a cyberterminal and uploaded via Hephaistos aux-
iliary ports in case of a hardware failure. All Hermes routers are
expandable as well, with healthy upgrade options in processing
power available immediately from Knight Errant.
Access Points
Knight Errant offers two styles of CCSS access ports to best
suit your needs. The Kronos line of master access points features
maximum bandwidth and responsiveness for corporate security
riggers, with the ability to control all linked security devices,
from doors to drones. Kronos offers a full range of LCD and plas-
ma displays for non-rigged security personnel, a remote-control
network bridge for remote drone control, and additional DNI
interfaces for backup personnel or in case of hardware failure.
Standard features include an integrated cyberterminal worksta-
tion for logging. After a security event, forensic evidence of
unauthorized entry can be examined in detail and the CCSS sys-
tem can be fine-tuned to close any discovered loopholes.
Auxiliary access points provide a valuable debugging tool
for any CCSS system. Due to their complex nature, a CCSS sys-
tem can often develop strange and unexpected behavior that
cannot be diagnosed properly from a command center's master
access point. Fortunately, debugging such a system can be made
easier by utilizing the Hephaistos brand auxiliary access points.
Auxiliary ports connect directly to both the master access port
and a segment of the CCSS network, such as a Constellation-IV
switch. This allows for local debugging of severed trunks and
misconfigured devices.
. The catalogue doesn't mention them, but there are also CCSS-
controlled security displays and intercoms that let the security rig-
ger display things for his more mobile buddies. Augmented secu-
rity guards can receive images and data straight into their heads
from the sec rigger. It's frightening to see such a system in action,
especially when they're gunning for you.
· Highwire
Matrix Interlinks
The Poseidon line of CCSS-Matrix interlinks provides a
seamless upgrade path from older Matrix-based security sys-
tems to CCSS security systems. Depending on the level of inte-
gration that your security system requires, the Poseidon
Interlink can be configured for one- or two-way communication
between systems. If your legacy network includes only passive
devices, a one-way Poseidon Interlink is right for you. But for
more complex devices, a fully two-way Poseidon Interlink will
fit your security needs.
Poseidon Interlinks carry Knight Errant's top of the line
encryption products, providing safe and secure communications
between all of your devices. Poseidon Interlinks can also be pro-
grammed to generate local traffic logs and forward them to a
Kronos master access point.
. Why anyone in this day and age would use Matrix-based
physical security is beyond me. These devices completely com-
promise a perfectly good CCSS network by allowing a decker
to inject false signals. Encryption to the CCSS system doesn't
equal signal integrity.
· Leggy
MATRIX SECURITY
Matrix security is largely based around architecture and
intrusion countermeasures. Proper use of these will provide the
necessary security on access points while not burdening systems
used for everyday work. Important hosts and networks should
not be connected to the Matrix, or should at least be linked only
through timed, teleporting and tiered access. Security deckers
should be used to provide on-the-spot investigation and
response to any intrusion. Matrix systems are vulnerable to
physical intrusions, and should be secured behind locked doors
with restricted access.
To access the full line of Knight Errant Matrix security prod-
ucts, visit our Matrix security host.
MAGICAL SECURITY
Conventional physical and technical security has no effect
on astral intruders, and modern security systems must guard
against the use of subversive and destructive magic. As
described in our magical security host, Knight Errant offers an
impressive range of astral and magical countermeasures in
addition to the services of trained magicians and mundane
magical specialists.
Spirits and Paranormal Guard Animals
Judicious use of spirits and paranormal animals can make a
tremendous difference when securing a facility. Knight Errant
offers an assortment of bound spirit and astral response services
at affordable prices. Paranormal guardian services come with
many associated costs (for training, feeding and handling), but are
an active, effective and unexpected resource to deploy against
intruders. For the complete line of Knight Errant's paranormal and
spirit licensing, services, products, training and specialists, visit
this host.
· A lot of corps balk at using paracritters. Remember that news
story about the hell hounds that sparked a fire and burned the
facility they were guarding down? There are too many horror
stories like that floating around the Matrix-guard critters eating
employees, destroying costly equipment, turning clients to
stone, escaping into the surrounding neighborhood and terror-
izing the yuppies, that sort of thing. I should know, I invented
some of them <display_grin>.
· Fisher
. Not all security firms are that circumspect about using para-
normals. And if you're on extraterritorial turf, the rules go right
out the window. Cockatrices, plasma and devil rats, oh my!
· Crazy Leon
Astral Barriers
The most effective astral intrusion passive countermeasures
are astral barriers such as wards, biofiber or guardian vines.
Wards are available in several forms (basic, alarm, polarized and
masking) and are ideal for protecting critical, high-security areas.
For the cost-conscious, biofiber and guardian vines can accom-
plish the same task.
Fluorescing Astral Bacteria (FAB)
Astral intrusion detection has become even easier with
our latest line of FAB injectors and containment units. Strain-I
bacteria is injected into secure areas in gaseous form. It pro-
vides excellent marking of astral intruders, fluorescing in the
ultraviolet spectrum when an astral form passes through the
cloud. Dual-natured strain-Il acts as a living astral barrier when
placed into nutrient suspension inside containment units; any
astral intruder will be trapped within a room surrounded by
FAB containment units.
. You'll note they don't mention Strain-III. You're not going to
find Strain-III outside of Chicago or extraterritorial grounds; the
UCAS classifies it as a Class C Controlled Substance. That's "bio-
logical agent of mass destruction" for the legally impaired.
· Faisal
Spellcraft
Knight Errant provides a range of options for integrating
anchored and quickened spells into your security scheme.
Quickened detection spells are a subtle method of identify-
ing or locating intruders, while security personnel can be
trained to utilize anchored barrier or other spells as emer-
gency magic support. Quickened illusion spells are also ideal
for fooling mundane criminals or concealing access points or
other features.
· This sort of thing is prohibitively expensive, so you're not likely
to see it often. Most corps have more cost-efficient methods of
providing magical security.

Fiberoptic Observation Network
A security magician's best friend, Knight Errant's
Prometheus system is a self-contained, non-electronic, fiberop-
tic-based observation network. This network extends a security
magician's visual line of sight, completely unencumbered by any
electronic devices. Now you can utilize your magician's spell-
casting capabilities from a well-protected area, rather than risk-
ing vital assets on the front line.
The Prometheus system employs high-precision refracting
cameras to collect the maximum amount of light. Precision-
ground lenses focus the light into zero-G-manufactured fiberop-
tic cable, preserving much of the original light intensity. To
counter potential light loss, it is highly recommended that Knight
Errant Daylight quartz lamps be installed to provide sufficient
light. These cameras can be attached to a manually operated
prism-mirror system, allowing the security magician to alternate
between cameras with the turn of a dial. The last component is
a goggle system that takes the image from the fiber and feeds it
to the mage's eyes.
· Scary system, neh? It should be, but for all the advantages it
supposedly grants, there are some very serious drawbacks.
Those refracting-light cameras are very good at drawing in
enough light that a mage 250 meters away can actually see
you, unaided by electronics. That also means he can see the
laser you shine in there or the Nova spell you drop on the cam-
era all the better.
· Firefly
. Also, If you can darken the room even just a little bit, you can
make it that much harder for the mage to target you with a
spell. The system relies on having more than normal office light-
ing. In semi-darkness, the usefulness of the system is negligible.
· TechWiz
· Properly trained security mages can deal with even those
adverse conditions; it's just more work to do so, and no system
worth its salt relies on the Prometheus alone.

PERSONNEL SERVICES
The weakest link in any security plan is metahumanity itself.
Any security plan can be compromised by improperly trained
security personnel or undermined by unscrupulous employees.
Knight Errant minimizes this threat with two types of services:
quality security staffing and personnel security.
Knight Errant offers the services of experienced, trained,
high quality security personnel for all of your needs. Our world-
class standard security officers can be contracted for site securi-
ty, perimeter patrol or emergency response. Matrix specialists
can monitor your private networks for vulnerabilities and intru-
sions, and security riggers can coordinate all aspects of your facil-
ity's defenses. Security magicians can astrally patrol or respond
to alarms from remote locations, or provide active magical
defenses on site. Our executive protection specialists offer the
best bodyguard, defensive driving, information control and
threat analysis and prevention services money can buy.
Knight Errant can also bring years of experience to your
doorstep with staff screenings, internal investigations, counter-
intelligence operations and security awareness trainings. For
more details, visit our personnel security host.
INTEGRATION
The best security devices and personnel in the world won't
amount to much if they are not coordinated, maintained and
deployed properly. In conjunction with Ares Security
International, Knight Errant provides consulting services to assist
you in strategic location scouting, security plan design, installa-
tion, personnel equipping and training and repair and mainte-
nance. Proper execution of security planning is what separates a
compromised facility-with potentially millions of nuyen in loss-
es-from a secure facility that produces the hottest new killer
product on the market.
PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
by Grey Knight
If you're still reading this far in, I think it's safe to say you're
not a drooling razorboy who's just interested in the latest toys.
You want to know your odds when facing down your next job,
and knowing how it all works together is the way to do that.
Since I occasionally hire freelancers like you, I'd rather have
competent professionals working for me than Anonymous
Ganger #3. So here is a condensed version of the training lecture
I've given several times. No B&E tips, though. For those, you'll
have to register for the full course like everyone else.
FENCES AND WALLS
The bones of any system are the barriers. Modern security
design shouldn't be obsessed with building "castles," but rather
places where the risk is greater than the reward of getting in.
Anyone can blow down just about any wall given enough explo-
sives, but then he's just made a large target of himself and put
everyone on high alert. The real idea behind fences and walls is
containment. Properly laid out fencing can seriously hamper any
entry or exit and give security time to neutralize your intruder,
who then gets to meet someone like me.
Getting in is always easier than getting out. Usually security
doesn't know you're making the attempt, otherwise you'd have
a lot of inconvenient guests hanging around. The solution to
making your exit is planning. Know your escape routes-and
you'd better have more than one-and make sure one of them
is clear when you need it. When the drek hits the fan, as it
inevitably will, you do not want to be improvising an out.
· And for Dog's sake, bring the tools appropriate for the obsta-
cles you are going to face. Wire cutters will not help you if the
walls are plasticrete.

LIGHTING AND DOORS
If you've ever had to get by a locked door, you know how
hard it can be when there's a spotlight on you. This isn't by acci-
dent; security designers know that illuminating a door is better
than keeping it in darkness. Your best bet in a situation like this
is to find a way to trick the light into not shining on you; if you
break the light, congratulations, you've just tripped an alarm.
Knowing what kind of lighting is being used can significant-
ly increase your chances of success. Corps love to save money,
so they like to use sodium- and mercury-vapor lamps. A power
interruption can give you a window of several minutes before
those lights come back on, and any backups won't have the
power of the mains.
DOORS AND LOCKS
A door is only as good as its lock, or so the saying goes.
Matching the level of security needed to a door is no mean
task. Overzealous security designers can seriously impair the
ability of employees to perform their tasks. Standard
cardreader and proxcard maglocks are more than enough for
everyday use. And putting the top of the line lock on a wood-
en door defeats the purpose of the lock if any chiphead can
kick the door down.
Key locks have their place, and can often be used very suc-
cessfully. Not too many runners expect to see a key lock-some
have never seen one until it's far too late to bring a lockpick
along. The proliferation of automatic lockpicks makes the use of
keyed locks problematic, as they can defeat most modern keyed
locks in seconds. Also, the physical keys have the bad habit of
being copied or "lost." Physical keys should not be relied upon
as the sole locking device for anything considered high security.
MAGLOCKS AND SENSORS
A maglock by itself is of no use. While a security rigger can
tell if a lock has been compromised, how can security make an
accurate assessment of the threat level? Do you have an armed
squad of shadowrunners making off with priceless research or
just Mr. Smith from the Engineering lab holding a door open too
long while he tries to score with Ms. Jones? Wise security plan-
ners use redundant devices to cover high-security areas with
overlapping coverage. Don't just put a visible-spectrum camera
on that maglocked door; use a thermal camera and pressure pad
in front of it as well.
Research and Development labs are prime targets for cor-
porate espionage; this much is not news to anyone. Taking a
cue from our Matrix-based security brethren-especially the
ultra-paranoid data havens-"killing jars" are the tool of choice.
Physical security killing jars use two or more sets of locks and
sensors to grant access to restricted areas. In order to access
the second lock, you have to open the first and enter a con-
tained area. This alone discourages many would-be intruders; if
they fail to overcome the second lock, they are now trapped in
a small place. Depending on corporate security directives,
once a killing jar is activated, neutralization methods can range
from soft (keep perpetrators alive) to hard (run a search on the
leftover genetic material).
SENSOR PLACEMENT
Placing sensors in the right places can make the differ-
ence between tracking everything that moves within your
facility and chasing your tail while looking like bumbling idiots.
Overlapping, intelligent placement of sensors will be of more
use than filling every corridor with every type of sensor imag-
inable. If you cover an area with either thermographic or
infrared sensors, use active infrared lighting and temperature
sensors as well. The infrared lighting will light up the area like
day and the temperature sensor will alert you to an increase in
ambient heat. If you use FAB-UV, place ultraviolet sensors at
different angles and use a Hermes router to generate a more
accurate map of astral activity. Most importantly, though, is to
not place sensors in places where authorized personnel will
continue to trip them. This only generates false positives,
wastes security riggers' time and will lead to security person-
nel ignoring future alerts in that area.
The new embedded sensor technology, while a hot product
that has a lot of promise, is not a panacea for all security con-
cerns. The enormous expense of smart walls should restrict its
use to high-profile targets only. Acceptable locations for smart
wall technology are executive offices where unobtrusiveness is a
virtue or clandestine research facilities where maintaining a low
profile is mandatory. Avoid the mantra of "more is better;" the
truth of quality security design is that intelligent placement of
sensors and barriers will beat most shadowrunners, especially
when paired with trained personnel.
SECURITY PROCEDURE TRAINING
Without training in security procedures, all of the latest toys
are worthless. You might as well fax your most secret plans right
to your competitors if your security is asleep at the switch, baf-
fled by what to do or still reading the manual on all those gad-
gets you bought. Security training is what makes a well-
designed system operate at peak efficiency. Trained individuals
know how to utilize the security system for their benefit, inter-
polating the data from the system to find intruders even when
the sensors can't locate them. A trained operator will know the
difference between a mechanical failure and a sabotaged device.
Security procedure training includes hardware familiariza-
tion, containment and neutralization techniques, basic forensic
procedures and data interpretation methods. An entry-level
course will focus primarily on the first three, whereas more
advanced training will focus on interpretation, system design
and security evasion and subversion techniques. Detailed train-
ing on subverting and evading security systems is available only
to select employees and contractors.

COST CONCERNS
Some customers fall into the "penny-wise, pound-foolish"
trap of security system design and skimp on necessary security
measures. They then complain to you when their cost-saving
measures cost them their proprietary data and fat bonus checks.
Insufficient infrastructure means insufficient data, which will
starve security of what it needs most. That said, there are many
cost-conscious means of securing a facility. False cameras,
dummy units and the like can be used as visible deterrents to
malicious behavior. While some crazed cultist tries to disable a
fake camera, your real security can observe and detain the
offender.
Conversely, a customer who wants to implement Daylight
quartz lighting in every office, EST along every hallway and
Hermes routers for every two light bulbs needs a lesson in eco-
nomics. Overkill is just as bad for security as undercutting; an
information glut requires more interconnects to support it and
more brains on wires to interpret it. Systems can be, and often
are, complex; that is the nature of the beast. The elegant solution
that covers the facility with the least amount of complexity nec-
essary is in the best interests of both the security provider and
their customers.

the security field advocate not to sell customers whatever they
wanted and instead focus on intelligent design planning. And
then he ran us through CQB drills, CCSS hardware demos and let
the mages in the group try out one of those Prometheus units.

TRICKS OF THE TRADE
by RoofRat
"Thou shalt not steal"-thus sayeth the Eighth
Commandment. Since a little bit of misappropriation became
very much taboo, people have been looking for ways to protect
what's theirs from those of us who said "No to Number Eight!"
If you check all the gadgets and doodads designed to keep the
modern asset relocation specialist away from people's stuff, you
wonder why we even bother trying! But as a friend of mine
always says, there's no such thing as an unbeatable security sys-
tem. For the proud owner, it all comes down to percentages-
building a security system that will stop all but the cream of the
professional crop from getting their grubby little mitts on your
prized possessions.
This poses a problem for all us freelance security consultants
who aren't necessarily the aforementioned cream. It can take a
veritable arsenal of gadgets, innovative and dangerous moves
and quite a healthy dollop of luck to get the job done. So, as a
favor to a friend, here're a few little tricks that have worked for
me during my career as a wealth redistribution agent. Hopefully
they'll help tip the scales in your favor against the latest greatest
security devices-for a couple of months at least, until they
come up with new gadgets to keep us away. And then we'll
come up with new tricks ...
So, you're visiting somewhere uninvited. The first thing to
put a damper on your day is a great big fence around your tar-
get. The absolute first step is to check if it's electrified; it sounds
obvious, but do not forget. Some electric fences, if they have
enough current going through them, will hum or tick with an
electric pulse. Unexpected wires or black boxes on the fence
supports are a dead giveaway, as are unusual chemical deposits
on the metal link. Or you could just push a teammate against the
wire and see if he goes bzzzt.
If the fence is electrified, toss a large rubber mat over the
top for insulation. Of course, more often than not the top of the
fence is festooned with pretty coils of razorwire aimed at turning
you into so much ground beef. This is not a good thing. I often
use my kevlar mesh security blanket layered over the top of the
razor wire, which allows me to scramble over relatively
unscathed. If you have magical support, a Levitate spell is obvi-
ous-but a tunnel under the fence from a kindly earth elemental
is subtler. Or, for the minimalists, paying a large troll 50¥ to
throw you over the fence works nicely if you know how to land
on the other side. The last three methods nicely bypass electric-
ity and razorwire in one fell swoop ... of course, if you're lucky
enough to be an adept you can just cheat and jump the fence.
Be wary of fences with naked fence poles extending a foot
or more above the fence proper. This is a neon sign saying
"Monowire This Way." Really, the only guaranteed way of deal-
ing with monowire is to cut it with a laser or heat cutter. Even if
you're not sure, run a laser cutter over the space just to be safe.
A word of warning though: if the monowire is high-tension, it
can lash out like a whip when it recoils from your cut-so keep
your head, hands and loved ones out of the way.
The fence was the easy part; the typical perimeter zone is
full of security patrols, guard animals, random sensors and
inquisitive elementals. The best strategy against guard patrols is
"don't be where they are." Do your homework, find out their
patrol routes and timing and plot your course accordingly. Guard
dogs can be trickier; I've found that a couple of water balloons
full of cat urine lobbed in opposite directions can keep them
occupied long enough for me to sneak past. Be careful where
you throw, though, because mis-throws that hit security guards
in the head are good for comedy value but bad for job security.
Illusion magic comes into its own here, too; well-placed
phantoms can have guards and dogs chasing their tails for valu-
able minutes, and illusory noises-over-there can help you evade
detection if they get too close. Just make sure your magical pal
checks carefully for magical security. A fire elemental that wants
to give you a hug or a watcher spirit with a penchant for tattling
can put a crimp in your well-laid plans. If you don't have a mag-
ical pal, get one; as far as I'm concerned, any place without mag-
ical security probably isn't guarding anything worth stealing.
Another danger inside the perimeter of most facilities is the
sneaky little devices that can be stuck anywhere, just waiting to
catch the unwary intruder. They are not the easiest things to
spot. Be on the lookout for things that are out of place; wires at
the base of trees, bushes that seem too strategically placed and
have little black nodules at regularly spaced intervals, plants that
give off way too much heat and any raised patches of ground.
When you finally reach the building, the first thing to do is
look for an entry point that isn't illuminated by a shaft of light
from heaven. Always check for cameras or other devices like
motion sensors near your entry point and try to take these out
first if they pose a risk of detection. It doesn't matter how well lit
a door is if no one is actually watching you try to open it. The
"burglar's tux," or ruthenium polymer jumpsuit, is the best way
to remain unseen, even in highly illuminated areas. These things
may be expensive, but if you have the means, I highly recom-
mend picking one up.
Dealing with a locked door can be tricky when under pres-
sure, so it's best to have a few aces up your sleeve to get in fast
and unnoticed. A maglock passkey will get you in the door fast,
but it has a tendency to mess up the lock and that may alert
security that all is not well the next time they open the door. If
possible, take down one of the guards and snag his passkey. This
works well if you are familiar with the security personnel's pro-
cedures, as you may know how long it will be before Joe Security
has to report in and what happens when he doesn't.
If the lock looks too hard to crack, then go for the hinges. If
the hinges aren't an option, you can always try for the wall beside
the door. If it's plasticrete, you can't do much short of breaking
out the thermite lance, but if the walls are of softer materials then
a good laser cutter might get you in. Another option is targeting
a window instead of a door. I've found that you can get some nice
solvents that will make light work of a perspex window in a short
time, and glasscutters are pretty self-explanatory.
If the doors and windows are too hard or too well lit, then
it's time to look for another way in. As my name suggests, my
particular preference for unlawful entry is the roof. A good set of
climbing gear and a grapple gun can have you on the roof very
quickly, if you know what you are doing. If the target building
has nearby neighbors of similar stature, you can get to the roof
without having to disturb the perimeter security at all. A nifty
trick for dealing with devices on the roof is to beg that shaman
friend of yours to summon a storm spirit to lightning strike the
little suckers into oblivion or to take down power lines to the
building or on-site generators. Of course, it can be easier to have
a decker buddy cut the power from the Matrix ... but the storm
spirit does it so much prettier. A nice little rainstorm can also do
wonders for limiting visibility for cameras and heat sensors.
If the building is non-extraterritorial, then it has to have
plans filed somewhere with authorities (though keep in mind
they may have made changes since the plans were filed). My
suggestion is to find a copy of these plans and locate the crawl
spaces or ventilation ducts for the building, which can be an easy
entry point with minimal security. If you are not claustrophobic,
there is usually enough space inside the roof of most buildings
to fit the most cunning affluence adjustment broker. Many ceil-
ings are a lot less sturdy than walls, so once you have navigated
to your goal via the blueprints, it is often an easy task to cut your
way down from the roof and claim the prize.
I could go on for days and days spewing forth a plethora of
tidbits for all of you budding (and not so budding) midnight
movers out there, but I'm not going to. A lot of the fun in what
we do comes from learning on the fly. Dangling upside down by
a rope over the two trolls with miniguns and leashed barghests,
saying to yourself "Shoulda seen that loose roof tile," is what this
job is all about. It's called experience, and everybody earns it dif-
ferently. So go forth into the night, use my tricks if you want, or
have fun finding your own. Just get out there and nick some stuff,
and hope the Eighth Commandment was only a suggestion.
GAME INFORMATION
This section provides information on using the various secu-
rity systems described above in a Shadowrun game.
Gamemasters should carefully tailor the toughness of security
systems to the storyline and style of play. Overcoming them
should require a combination of dice-rolling and roleplaying.
Security systems should be reasonably challenging to shad-
owrunners-perhaps even a serious threat to their lives-but an
insurmountable fortress that shadowrunners cannot breach will
not be fun for anyone. The gamemaster should always be careful
to include kinks and flaws in a security system that clever shad-
owrunners can discover and exploit.
The following rules include material previously issued in
Security Systems, pp. 232-237, SR3 and also pp. 89-90.
SRComp, so that a gamemaster can find all of the information in
one place. It also expands on them with new complications and
new methods of bypassing security.
In any case where rules presented here contradict rules in
another sourcebook, use the rules here.
FENCES
Fences can be climbed (see p. 44, SRComp), or characters
can cut through them with a pair of wire clippers (p.293, SR3),
at a speed of (Strength + 2, round up) in meters per minute.
Sensors can be attached to fences to detect attempts to scale the
fence. The most typical are capacitance wire (p. 97) and
sound/vibration sensors (p. 99).
Wire
The Wire/Tripwire Table (p. 96) provides Perception Test tar-
get numbers for characters to notice different fencing wire. The
Wire Damage Table (p. 96) provides Damage Codes for charac-
ters that grab, walk or run into wire. Impact armor offers one-half
(round down) protection against this damage. Cutting the wire
with wire clippers requires a Strength (6) Test. Monowire only
requires a Strength (5) Test to cut, but if the loose ends are not
secured, a Quickness (6) Test is required to avoid being hit by
whipping monowire that inflicts 10S damage.
Electrified Fences/Wire
A character who touches an electrified fence or electrified
wire takes 4D Stun damage as if from a Shock weapon (p. 124,
SR3). The character must also succeed in a Body (6) Test to
remove her paralyzed hands from the fence, or she will contin-
ue to take 4D at the end of each Combat Turn. A character
knocked unconscious will take one last 4D zap before her mus-
cles relax and she slumps to the ground.
To bypass electrified fencing/wire, characters can either cut
the electricity to the fence/wire or just risk damage and directly
cut the fence/wire. Proper insulation can reduce the electricity's

power, and levitation or other methods of not being grounded
renders the person immune to damage. Remember that holding
on to a pair of clippers, which then touch the electrified
fence/wire, counts as grounding yourself.
Sensors that measure the current flow and resistance
through the fence/wire may guard electrified fencing/wire. At
the gamemaster's discretion, the sensors may detect if the
fence/wire is cut or if a character is electrified on it.
WALLS
Walls can be climbed (see p. 44, SRComp), or characters can
try to break through them with explosives or other tools (use the
rules for Barriers, p. 124, SR3). See the expanded list of Security
Barrier Ratings. When trying to blow up a section of wall, use the
rules for Blast Against Barriers, p. 119, SR3. If the wall holds, the
blast may be redirected or channeled (see Blast in a Confined
Space, p. 119, SR3).
Some shoddily constructed plasticrete walls can be dis-
solved into a mass of goo with the right solvents, like Plastisteel-
7 (p. 113, M&M). These brands look just like properly construct-
ed walls, so only diligent legwork can reveal the existence of
faulty plasticrete. Inspection of the wall will reveal nothing with-
out a Chemistry or Engineering (8) Test.
Tunneling
For the patient, one method of bypassing a wall is to tunnel
underneath it. Tunneling only works on natural substances like
soil, loose rock and sand-concrete, metal and plastic hybrids
must be broken through using their Barrier rating.
Tunneling characters must make a Body Test against the tar-
get number given on the Tunneling table (p. 96). Apply a +2
modifier if the digger's tools are inadequate. The amount of
material they can dig out each hour is equal to the Amount list-
ed times their successes. Civil Engineering skill (p. 104) may be
used as a Complementary skill.
For deep or long tunnels, characters must make a Civil
Engineering Test against the same target number per day to
avoid a collapse. At the end of a tunneling project, the project
leader can make an Open Civil Engineering Test. The result is
the effective Barrier rating of the tunnel's walls, indicating the
tunnel's structural integrity against explosions or magic. If a tun-
nel wall is breached, the tunnel collapses.
LIGHTING
Incandescent, fluorescent and halogen lights all turn on and
off instantaneously. Due to the heat generated by halogen lights,
prolonged, direct exposure to the bulb can cause flammable
materials to ignite. Gaseous-discharge lamps take five minutes
to warm up fully. Once hot, mercury-vapor lamps take ten min-
utes to relight, while sodium-vapor lamps take fifteen minutes.
Active infrared lamps provide sufficient illumination for both
thermographic and infrared sensors.
Ultraviolet lights emit both in the ultraviolet and the blue end
of the visible light spectrum. People exposed to high levels of
ultraviolet light for several minutes or more, however, can suffer
from burns on unprotected skin, glare if not wearing amber-tint
protective glasses or flare compensators and other unpleasant
side effects. Ultraviolet lamps can also be used in forensic work,
as they reveal biological and mineral traces that are invisible
under white light.

Light switches can be subverted with two

Each takes a base time of 30 seconds, modified
by successes.
DOORS AND WINDOWS
Doors and windows are often wired with
alarm systems that will alert a security system
if the door is opened improperly. In order to
bypass such a system, a character needs to
make a Perception (alarm rating) Test to locate
it, and then an Electronics (alarm rating) Test
to disable it with a base time of 5 minutes;
apply Build/Repair modifiers from p. 95, SR3.
To batter down a door, follow the rules for Breaking
Through, p. 125, SR3.
Glass windows can be scored and cut with a proper glass-
cutting tool. The tool's rating must be equal to or greater than
the Barrier rating of the window's material. A tool laser (p.15,
M&M) can also be used against windows with a Barrier rating of
10 or less.
Climbing in a window generally requires an Athletics (2)
Test, though windows at odd heights or angles may require an
appropriate Climbing Test (p. 44, SRComp). Depending on the
size of the window, some characters (especially orks and trolls)
may have trouble climbing through (or simply may not fit).
HVAC
Heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems
are an often-overlooked part of security design. Industrial HVAC
systems may use ductwork large enough for a metahuman to fit
inside (though orks and trolls simply might not fit). Crawling
through ductwork is a laborious process, and a character can
only move his Quickness in meters per minute. Characters may
often encounter fan units in the ducting, which require an
Electronics (4) Test to disable and an Electronics B/R (4) Test to
remove. Fans may also be alarmed in the same manner as doors
and windows.
Large main circulatory fans cannot be removed by charac-
ters and must be disabled so the character can pass through the
stopped blades. If a character sticks his hand, falls, or is otherwise
forced into a working fan, that character will suffer 4M Physical
damage from ductwork fans and 8S from main fans.
Some facilities employ an air duct "cooking system," an
ellipsoid section of ductwork with reflective surfaces that
scorches passing air with UV light, killing most airborne
pathogens and preventing their spread through the facility.
These UV furnaces pose no hazard to metahumans that pass
through, and they can be disabled with an Electronics B/R (4)
Test and a base time of 1 minute.

SWITCH ALARMS
Switch alarms are mechanical or electronic systems
designed to be "tripped" by intruders, triggering an alarm.
Switch alarms can be set up so that they automatically trigger
more active security measures when they go off.
The Wire/Tripwire Table (p. 96) lists the target numbers for
Perception Tests to notice various types of alarm systems.
Capacitance Wire
Capacitance or proximity wire has a range of only 2 meters,
but it will detect any living body that enters that range. The
drawback is that capacitance wire cannot distinguish between
metahumans and animals.
Trip Beam Systems
Lasers or beams of high-intensity conventional lights serve
as the equivalent of trip wires when fired across an area at a
detector. Mirrors or reflectors may bounce the beam around an
area before it reaches the detector, thereby increasing the
amount of space covered and also creating an intricate web that
player characters will find difficult to navigate. Interrupting the
beam triggers an alarm.
Trip beams can be either obvious, placed as a visible deter-
rent, or invisible. The target number to notice a trip beam (or at
least the emitting devices) is on the Wire/Tripwire Table (p. 96);
apply appropriate Visibility modifiers (p. 232, SR3). Note that
smoke will enhance the visibility of the beam, rather than reduce
visibility. The old trick of spraying an aerosol into the area pro-
tected by the beam(s) to increase their visibility still works (apply
a -1 modifier), but at the gamemaster's discretion may trigger
certain sensitive alarm systems often found in environmentally
controlled interior areas.

To bypass trip beams, a character can make a Quickness Test
against a target number devised by the gamemaster (4 and up),
depending on the extent of the beam coverage. Characters will
find it impossible, however, to bypass some trip beams in this
manner. Emitters and reflectors can be constructed to reroute the
beam(s), but to do so requires knowledge of the system in
advance, a steady hand and luck. A player character trying this
tactic under the best possible conditions (possession of the trip
beam's design schematics and plenty of time to study them)
must make a successful Quickness (8) Test. The target number for
this test rises to 12 if the character has only a picture of the sys-
tem, and to 16 if the character has neither a picture nor the
design schematics. The base time for coming up with a scheme
and the necessary equipment to bypass a trip beam is 1 week.
The most common method of bypassing a trip beam is to
create a proxy beam by aiming additional emitters of the
appropriate type at the detectors. When the character breaks
the trip beam, the proxy emitter sends sufficient beam wattage
to the detector, fooling it into thinking everything is fine. One
proxy emitter is required for each detector used by the trip
beam. Setting up the proxy beam requires a successful
Reaction (6) Test. If the test is unsuccessful, breaking the trip
beam triggers the alarm.
Laser trip beams can also be configured to emit a damaging
laser pulse. If the beam is broken and an alarm is triggered, such
a laser beam will inflict a 10M wound (reduced by half Impact
armor, round down). The
laser's effectiveness and
Power are modified via the
conditions outlined on p.
30, CC.

use wire or contact switch-
Pressure Pad
es, which can be avoided
or tricked and cut. To trick a
wire, the character must
place the exact current into
the receiving end while maintaining the tension; this requires an
Electronics (4) Test and a Reaction (4) Test; if one character is
performing both actions, apply a +2 modifier to each.
Characters can use a simple string with a weighted bit to
test an area for mechanical tripwires; the string will hang on the
tripwire without setting it off if the character makes a successful
Quickness (4) Test.
Pressure Mesh and Pads
Pressure mesh and pads are weight-triggered sensors usu-
ally concealed beneath the ground (pressure mesh) or flooring
(pressure pads). The sensitivity of these pressure devices may
differ, however, especially in areas where patrol animals or
drones are used. The less sensitive the device, the easier it is to
avoid tripping it.
The target number to notice a mesh or pad is given on the
Wire/Tripwire Table (p. 96). After a character has stepped on a
pressure mesh/pad, make a second Perception Test against the
same target number, with a -2 modifier. If the test is unsuccess-
ful, the character trips the alarm. If the test is successful, the char-
acter knows he or she is stepping on a pressure sensor and can
try to remove the pressure before it exceeds the device's sensi-
tivity. To accomplish this, the character must make a successful
Reaction Test against the appropriate sensitivity level (see the
Pressure Sensor Sensitivity Table), plus the character's natural
Body Rating. Apply a +2 modifier if the character is running.
CAMERAS AND VISUAL SENSORS
Sensors are sometimes placed to be obvious and easily seen,
to act as a psychological deterrent for criminals. Other sensors are
hidden, so as to catch intruders unaware. The Perception Test tar-
get number to notice sensors is based on their Concealability. At
the gamemaster's discretion, sensors may be camouflaged or dis-
guised as other objects, increasing the target number. Cameras
may also have microphones attached, allowing security guards to
overhear conversation and sounds in their vicinity.
Shining a bright light at video cameras and other visual sen-
sors will inflict glare Perception Test modifiers (+2) on any char-
acter attempting to see through them.

Low-Light
Low-light sensors amplify
visible light and some portions
of the very near infrared to pro-
duce an image. Colors are usu-
ally lost in the green-tint
image, but high-rating state-of-
the-art low-light sensors retain
some of the color of the origi-
nal, albeit very muted and
washed out.
Bright, directed light can
burn out light-amplifying sen-
sors. To target a sensor with a laser requires a Laser Weapons
Test, just like ranged combat. Sensors can also be targeted with
spells that utilize the elemental effect of Light (p. 52, MITS). If a
number of successes are scored exceeding the sensor's rating,
the sensor is burned out and useless until repaired. Otherwise,
the sensor is merely dazzled; apply a +4 modifier to any
Perception Tests made via the sensor.
Thermographic
Thermographic sensors detect emitted heat signatures in the
far infrared and convert them into a visible image. Infrared sensors
work in the near to mid infrared range, which is generally reflect-
ed infrared light. All colors are lost in thermographic and infrared.
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet sensors cannot generally detect anything in the
visible spectrum, and are useful only when there is a source of
ultraviolet light, such as FAB or UV lamps. Ultraviolet sensors are
also useful for detecting characters or objects that have been
"tagged" or marked with UV-sensitive dye.

character may move only half a meter per
turn when trying to avoid detection.
Characters who want to move faster (1
meter per turn) must add +3 to the target
number of the Opposed Test. Characters
who move faster than 1 meter per turn
automatically set off vibration detectors.
Pheromone Scanners
Pheromone scanners detect the
pheromones a metahuman body releases
into the air. They are primarily useful in
detecting people who have hidden them-
selves by technological or magical means
from more mundane security devices. Pheromone scanners can
distinguish between metahuman and animal pheromones, but
are not yet accurate enough to pick out an individual. In order to
pick up the scent, the scanner rolls its rating against the charac-
ter's or animal's base signature (6 for most metahumans, 5 for
trolls-see p.104, CO),
modified by various cir-
cumstances (see table).
AREA SENSORS
Area sensors monitor a specific contained area (usually a
room or hallway) for environmental changes.
Motion Sensors
Motion sensors usually transmit an ultrasonic field and react
to changes in the
field when someone
enters the area.
Simple ultrasound
detectors (see p.

Magnetic anomaly
detectors detect metallic substances. In order to detect a
weapon or other metal item, the scanner rolls its rating against
the Concealability rating of the weapon or item-any success
detects it. Note that visual Concealability modifiers from lined
coats and so on do not affect this test, as they have no effect on
the magnetic field. MADs can also detect etcher taggant nanites
with a Rating (3) Test.
Chemsniffers
Chemical detection systems analyze molecules in the air,
and are specifically designed to detect explosives or ammunition
propellant. To determine if a chemsniffer detects explosives or
ammo, make a Rating (10) Test, modified as per the Chemical
Detection Modifiers Table. One success is all that is needed to
detect the explosives or ammunition.
Some facilities may
use pheromone scan-
ners as a biometric key
for maglocks, though
this is only applicable
for users with tailored
pheromones or scent

SCANNERS
The following rules

scanners.

Characters may also move faster (2 meters per Combat
Turn) by using an ultrasound emitter/detector (see p. 293, SR3)
to spook or confound the sensor. To do so, make an Opposed

Apply a -1 modifier for each half meter slower than 2 meters per
turn the character moves.
Sound/Vibration Detectors
Vibration detectors are small microphones affixed to doors,
fences, windowpanes, floors, and so forth that pick up noise or
vibrations from movement and transmit them to a computer for
analysis. If a shadowrunner knows that a sound/vibration detec-

Cyberware Scanners
Cyberware scanners use ultrasonic and magnetic scanning
to pick up implants. When used on a character with implants,
make a Rating Test against the appropriate target number from
the Cyberware Scanner Table. Extra successes beyond the mini-
mum required produce more detailed information on the cyber-
netics detected.
TUMBLER LOCKS
To pick old-fashioned tumbler locks, a character can use
lockpick tools, an autopicker or improvise with some wire. If the
character is using an autopicker, simply make an Opposed Test
between the autopicker and lock ratings. If the autopicker wins,
the lock is opened. Using an autopicker takes a base time of 10
seconds; successes reduce this period.
To pick a lock by hand, the character makes a test using
Lock Picking skill (see p. 104) against the lock's rating. Apply
appropriate modifiers from the Build/Repair Table (p. 95, SR3).
Manual lockpicking takes a base time of 60 seconds, modified
by successes.
Transponder-Embedded Keys
Transponder-embedded keys have a calibrated resistor in
them that completes a circuit in the lock. In order to pick a
lock requiring one of these keys by hand, an electronics kit is
needed to generate the appropriate electrical characteristics.
This requires a successful Electronics (Lock Rating) Test at the
same time the lock is picked. If the same character is picking
the lock and calibrating the electrical feed, apply a +2 mod-
ifier to both tests.
MAGLOCKS
Maglock "keys" can be physical (keypad, swipe card,
proximity card, memory string) or biometric (see below), or
any combination thereof.
Maglocks can be wired into and controlled via a facility's
Matrix system (making them vulnerable to deckers through
the Slave subsystem) and/or a security rigger CCSS system.
Maglock systems often log all usages, keeping track of
the time, date and identity of each user.
Removing the Case
The first step to bypassing a maglock requires the charac-
ter to first remove the case and access the maglock's elec-
tronic "guts." To remove the case, the character must make a
successful Electronics B/R (Maglock Rating) Test, with a base
time of 60 seconds, reduced by successes. Failure simply
means the character has not removed the case. If all else fails,
the case can be smashed or shot off; treat the case as if it has
a Barrier rating equal to the maglock rating. Overzealous
attempts to break the case may harm the electronics inside.
Anti-Tamper Systems: Some maglock systems come
equipped with anti-tamper systems, rated between 1 and 4. In
order to bypass the anti-tamper circuits, compare the dice roll
from the Electronics B/R Test made to remove the cover to a tar-
get number equal to (maglock rating + anti-tamper rating). If this
target number was not achieved, then the alarm was triggered.
It is possible to remove the case but still trigger the alarm.
Re-Assembly: After the character has tinkered with the
maglock's insides, the case can be re-assembled so that it is not
immediately noticeable that the maglock has been tampered
with. This requires the same test as removing the case, but note
the number of successes-this number is the target number for
any Perceptions Tests made if the lock is specifically examined
for signs of tampering.
Hotwiring Maglocks
Any maglock can simply be "hotwired" in order to circum-
vent it. To hotwire a maglock, the character must first remove
the case (see above). The character must then succeed in an
Electronics (Maglock Rating) Test with a base time of 60 seconds.
Apply appropriate modifiers from the Maglock Hotwiring Table
(p. 101). Failure triggers an alarm.

Keypads
Maglock keypads can be accessed with a valid passcode. If
the characters can somehow obtain the passcode, they can eas-
ily enter (though it may change on a frequent or random basis).
Keypads can also be bypassed with a sequencer (see p.
293, SR3) that brute-forces the maglock by quickly running
through passcode combinations. To use a sequencer, the case
must first be removed (see above). Make an Opposed Test
between the sequencer and maglock ratings. If the sequencer
wins, the lock is bypassed; extra successes reduce the 10-sec-
ond base time. If the maglock wins, an alarm is triggered. In
the case of a tie, the full 10 seconds pass, and a new opposed
Test must be rolled.
Memory String
Encrypted code strings can be stored inside a user's
headware memory or data lock cyberware. The user jacks in to
the maglock, which then verifies the code's authenticity. To
bypass such a system, the code string in a valid user's head
must be accessed and decrypted. Once the string is discov-
ered, it can be encrypted and stored inside another character's
headware memory.
Proximity Cards
Proximity cards contain a particular electromagnetic pattern
or micro-range radio beacon. The maglock detects the card
when it comes within range, which can be anywhere from a few
meters away to swiping the card up against a reader. Proximity
cards are favored because they are quick.
Swipe Cards
Swipecards usually carry identifying information in a bar-
code or microchip. The card must be swiped through a card
reader for the user to pass. Swipe card maglocks can be
bypassed with a maglock passkey (p. 293, SR3). Using a passkey
does not require removing the case; the passkey is simply slot-
ted in the reader and an Opposed Test is made between the
passkey and maglock ratings. If the passkey wins, the lock is
bypassed; extra successes reduce the 10-second base time. If
the maglock wins, an alarm is triggered. In the case of a tie, the
full 10 seconds pass, and a new opposed Test must be rolled.
BIOMETRIC SCANNERS
Biometric systems work by measuring a "print" (finger, reti-
nal, voice, etc.) from the user and checking the measured print
for matches in a database of authorized prints. This means bio-
metric scanners almost always have a Matrix or CCSS connec-
tion. Because the print-matching takes place in a remote data-
base, biometric scanners tend to be harder to bypass. If the char-
acters can access the database (whether by decking or other
means), they can modify it to include their own print records as
authorized personnel. This is a risky route, however, as the sys-
tem will retain their records and log what they accessed (unless
those records are also modified later).
Breath
Breath scanners rely on exhaled particles. In order to get
enough particles for the scanner to use, the person needs to
cough into the sensor. The particles are then filtered and genet-
ic material extracted from the saliva and mucus contained in the
exhaled breath. That material is then analyzed like a DNA scan-
ner (below). In order to fool such a system, a sprayer must be
used to deliver a sample of the correct genetic material to the
sensor preserved in a specially formulated enzyme bath. The
sample has a Rating 8 starting from when it leaves the body; this
rating decreases by 1 point per half hour; if a Preserve spell is
used, it loses 1 point per hour. The enzyme bath can be synthe-
sized in a chemistry shop with a Chemistry (4) Test and a base
time of 8 hours. If not kept chilled, the enzymes will degrade,
losing 1 point of rating per half hour.
Cellular and DNA
Cellular and DNA scanners collect a sample of the user's
cells (usually off the finger/palm, though occasionally mouth
swabs, hair suction or other methods are used). Cellular scanners
examine the "fingerprint" of the cell's exterior. DNA scanners
extract DNA from the cells, amplify it and then compare it
against a profile stored in a system. Either way, the sample is
reduced and analyzed, making it unsuitable for a material link.
"Dead" cell samples from an authorized user can be used
to fool cellular/DNA scanners; make an Opposed Test between
a Rating 8 and the scanner rating. Cells lose 1 rating point per
half hour; if sustained by a Preserve spell, the rate drops to 1
point per hour.
As an additional layer of security for DNA scanners, autho-
rized users can be required to carry marker taggant nanites (see
p. 95, M&M). When the scanner performs genetic testing, it also
checks for the appropriate nanites.
Facial Recognition
Facial recognition scanners use imaging lasers, thermo-
graphic and/or ultrasonic waves to map a person's face. These
are one of the least intrusive, but also least accurate, biometric
recognition systems. Facial recognition systems are useful not
just for letting authorized people in, but also for identifying
unwanted people and keeping them out.
Prosthetic makeup and biosculpting can be used with vary-
ing degrees of effectiveness against facial recognition; using
either requires a Success Contest. The facial recognition system
makes a Rating (4) Test; apply a +2 modifier if the system is pick-
ing faces out of a crowd.
A character trying to avoid recognition makes either a
Stealth (4) Test or a Disguise (4) Test (see Disguise skill, p. 104)
if using prosthetics, while a character using make-up and pros-
thetics to pass as someone else makes a Disguise (6) Test.
If a character has undergone cosmetic surgery (p. 146, Man
& Machine), the facial recognition scanner must succeed in a
Rating (8) Test to not be fooled; apply a +2 modifier if the char-
acter has the Natural Look surgical option.
Finger and Palmprint
Finger and palm print scanners work by passing a laser over
the finger or palm and comparing it against a database of autho-
rized prints. There are several methods that can be used to
bypass them.
A finger or palm still attached to its living owner always
works properly for a print scan. Actual fingers or hands, removed
from the owner, may be used, but require an Opposed Rating
Test between the digit/hand and scanner. Removed appendages
have a rating of 8, but lose 1 rating point per hour after being
removed. Proper care of the appendage, such as casting a
Preserve spell on it, can slow the rating loss to 1 point per 3
hours. Note that some advanced systems detect the electrical
resistance of the hand to determine whether the appendage has
been severed or not. These guidelines also apply to the use of a
finger or palm still attached to a dead person.
If a sample of the original finger/palm print is obtained, there
are several methods to duplicate the print. First, nanite fingerprint
mappers may be used (p. 92, M&M). Second, a synthetic glove-
like membrane (a "sleeve") can be created with a cellular glove
molder. Third, a laser-etched polymer coating can be applied
directly to the hand; this has the advantage of counteracting the
loss of conductivity. The polymer loses its effectiveness the longer
the hand is used, at a rate of 1 rating point per hour (double this
rate in the case of climbing, fighting or other exertion).
If any of these synthetic prints are used, make an Opposed
Rating Test between the scanner and the fake print. If the print
wins, access is gained. If the scanner wins, an alarm is triggered.
On a tie, the system requests a re-try.
Retinal
Retinal scanners use a low-powered laser to examine the
retina. Both retinal duplication (p. 300, SR3) and nanotech retinal
tailors (p. 94, M&M) can be used to trick retinal scanners. Eyeballs
liberated from their original owners are useless with retinal scan-
ners. Eyes still in the head of a dead person can be used, make an
Opposed Test between a Rating 8 and the scanner rating; these
eyes lose 1 rating point per half hour. If the head is preserved with
a Preserve spell, the rate drops to 1 point per hour.
Retinal systems can be dangerous to intruders. If a security
rigger triggers an active alert, the laser's output can be increased
to lethal levels against unauthorized users, dealing damage as
the Ares Redline (p. 30, CC) bypassing any armor and resisted
by unaugmented Body.
Voiceprint
A voiceprint scanner samples a speaker's voice with a
microphone and matches the voice pattern. Characters can
defeat voice scanners by coercing an authorized user to speak,
but such systems often have keywords (known to authorized
users) that will automatically trigger an alarm if spoken.
An audio recording of an authorized user's voice can be used
to bypass voiceprint scanners, if the recording is good enough.
Make an Opposed Test between the rating of the scanner and the
rating of the recorder used to record the voice. The system that
generates the most successes wins. Ties produce no results for
either system, and the recognition system repeats its request for
a response. Accessories to the voice modulator cyberware (p.
301, SR3) can also be used to mimic or playback a voice record-
ing in order to bypass such systems (make the same Opposed
Test as described above).
For additional security, voiceprint scanners may require the
user to speak a specific passphrase.
SMART WALLS
Using "embedded sensor technology," smart walls are virtu-
ally indistinguishable from normal walls. The nanotech-devised
sensors they contain are incredibly hard to detect: Concealability
of (8 + sensor rating) per unit. All sensors in a smart wall unit must
be of the same rating. Range of the wall unit is per sensor and tied
to the rating of the sensor. All Smart Walls must be connected to
a CCSS system, utilizing one router per wall unit; a central router
unit ties together all wall units. Getting by smart walls is the same
as for any other kind of sensor, if you can identify the sensors.
CCSS INFRASTRUCTURE
The closed-circuit simsense systems used by security rig-
gers are described in detail on p. 45, R3.
Access Points
As described on p. 49, R3, the first step to subverting a CCSS
system is to tap into it. To crack open a CCSS-linked device, fol-
low the same procedure as removing maglock cases (see p. 100).
CCSS devices may sometimes be fitted with anti-tamper circuits.
If the character can find a master or auxiliary access point,
she does not need to crack open the casing nor is a dataline tap

necessary-the rigger can simply jack right in. The master access
point for any CCSS system is the control center, where the on-
duty security rigger can be found. There are no extra security fea-
tures to a master access point, so it must be secured as any other
room. Auxiliary access points allow roving security riggers to
both debug equipment faults and provide backup to the prima-
ry security rigger. Both master and auxiliary access points pro-
vide direct access to the CCSS system, and auxiliary access
points are usually heavily disguised, secured with locks and
under scrutiny by the system.
Matrix Interlinks
CCSS-Matrix interlinks provide a means for CCSS systems to
control Matrix-based security devices. One-way interlinks only
allow communication from the Matrix system to the CCSS system
and are useful for monitoring legacy Matrix security devices. Two-
way interlinks allow full communication between the Matrix and
CCSS systems. An interlink must have a rating equal to the encryp-
tion level of the CCSS system to translate the Matrix signals.
Integrated Control Centers
Integrated control centers combine the CCSS control center
with a Matrix-interlinked secured cyberterminal, Prometheus
fiberoptic observation network (p. 91), multiple display screens
and redundant jackpoints. Integrated control centers cover
CCSS, Matrix and even magical security all in one place.
ACTIVE SECURITY MEASURES
There is a vast array of active security measures that can be
deployed to deal with intrusion threats-too many, in fact, to
describe them all here. In addition to trained security guards,
patrolling drones, automatic gun-port systems and paranormal
animal or cybered guard critters, a few specific measures are
described below.
Gas Delivery Systems
Because timing is everything when determining the effec-
tiveness of a gas-dispersal system, the gamemaster should use
the following rules to determine how quickly the gas spreads,
how quickly the characters notice it (if at all) and how quickly
they can take action.
Dispersal systems can fill an area of 30 cubic meters in one
Combat Turn (3 seconds). No simple way exists to determine
exactly how quickly the gas spreads, but the following guide-
lines should serve in most cases. Gamemasters should feel free
to make any on-the-spot modifications necessary.
The gas will spread at a rate of about 10 cubic meters
(roughly 2 meters high, 2 meters wide, by 2.5 meters deep)
every second. Approximate this by having the gas spread 10
cubic meters each Initiative Pass, up to a maximum of 3 Initiative
Passes per Combat Turn.
The gas starts spreading at the end of the Initiative Pass in
which it was triggered, and always goes last during each
Initiative pass. Characters who have Delayed Actions may make
a Perception Test at the time of exposure to recognize the pres-
ence of the gas by rolling a number of dice equal to their
Intelligence against a Target Number of 10, using the appropri-
ate Perception Test modifiers. Characters equipped with a gas
detection system (see p. 293, SR3) may be alerted by their gear.
See p. 250, SR3, or pp. 117-121, M&M, for details on var-
lous gases and how they will affect characters.
Note that gas-based security systems are difficult to detect
and react to, and give players little or no chance to deal with a
bad scene. Gamemasters should always try to provide the play-
ers with some sort of solution to a situation. No-win is no fun.
Nanotech Taggant Gas
Nanotech taggant gas is an odorless, colorless gas contain-
ing nanotech taggants (p. 94, M&M). The taggant gas is deliv-
ered via a spray tank, gas grenade or gas delivery system
(above). Exposed characters inhale the taggants through their
respiratory system.
Any character who breathes within the taggant cloud is
exposed to the nanites. Nanite loss is also a reality with taggant
clouds. To determine the percentage of nanites inhaled, use the
following formula: (character Body - air filter rating) x 5 percent.
For every full Combat Turn of continued exposure, increase the
amount by (Body) percent. Once inhaled, treat the taggants as a
regular free-floating system (nanite loss of 3 percent per day). If
the character has any sort of blood filtering cyberware or bioware,
nanite loss is escalated to ([filter rating + 1] x 3) percent per day.
MATRIX SECURITY
With the introduction of CCSS systems in the early 2050's,
companies have moved security for buildings off the Matrix and
onto dedicated systems. There are still some legacy systems,
however, used because of the low cost. Security devices
attached to a Matrix host are accessed by successful Slave oper-
ations. Intrusion countermeasures can be utilized to protect
slaved devices, such as Scramble IC sitting on a security camera
or Sparky IC monitoring a security door's slave node.
Matrix security is described in detail on pp. 199-230 and
237, SR3, and p. 110-123, Matrix.
MAGICAL SECURITY
Astral security is described on pp. 88-91, MITS.
Fluorescing Astral Bacteria Devices
Fluorescing astral bacteria (pp. 90-91, MITS) is a form of
astrally-sensitive (Strain-I) or dual-natured (Strain-II) genetically-
engineered bacteria. FAB can only be used in a security context
if applied with special equipment.
Strain-I FAB is deployed from container tanks via injector
nozzles into sealed areas as an odorless, colorless gas. When an
astral form passes through the area, the FAB dies and fluoresces
UV light. UV sensors can detect this light and trigger an alarm
that an astral intruder is present.
Strain-Il is held in nutrient solution inside FAB containment
units sandwiched between walls, creating an astral barrier.
Prometheus Fiberoptic Observation Network
Spellcasting through the fiberoptic network is more difficult
than standard spellcasting. For every 50 meters of distance the
observation camera is from the security mage, a +1 modifier to
the Sorcery Test target number and +2 modifier to the Drain Test

target number are added. Also, because of the extreme depen-
dency on the available light, all target number modifiers due to
insufficient lighting are doubled. Only spellcasting can be
accomplished through the Prometheus; spirits cannot be com-
manded or conjured, nor can astral perception be used. It is
unwise to cast elemental manipulation spells through this sys-
tem, as they take a direct physical path from caster to target
(i.e., through walls, cubicles and everything else in between)-
which would be spectacular, but messy.
The Prometheus Fiberoptic Observation Network has a
maximum range of 250 meters.
NEW ACTIVE SKILLS
Players will find the following new skills helpful when deal-
ing with security systems.
Disguise (Intelligence)
This skill covers the use and creation of prosthetic makeup,
wigs, false beards, and so on to alter a person's appearance, usu-
ally for entertainment purposes or to evade notice. This skill
should not be confused with hiding, which is the province of the
Stealth skill.
Defaults: Intelligence attribute
Specializations: Cosmetic, Theatrical, Trideo
Lock Picking (Quickness)
The Lock Picking skill governs the ability to defeat mechan-
ical locks. Use of this skill requires appropriate (or at least impro-
vised) tools and is useless against maglocks, though it can be
used as a Complementary skill with Electronics (Security
Systems) against mixed electronic/mechanical systems.
Defaults: Quickness Attribute
Specializations: Cam, Dimple-Cylinder, Pin Tumbler,
Safecracking, Wafer, Water
Security Systems (Specialization of Electronics)
This specialization of the Electronics skill (p. 88, SR3) covers
the ability to operate and understand all forms of electronic secu-
rity systems and the devices used in them. The Build/Repair ver-
sion covers installation, testing and repair.
NEW KNOWLEDGE SKILLS
One drawback to using realistic, high-level security systems
in a Shadowrun game is that the players themselves are often not
as well-versed in how security systems work and how they can
be circumvented as their characters should be. This is where secu-
rity-oriented Knowledge skills come
into play. Players can use their charac-
ter's Knowledge skills to evaluate secu-

they can use to get around them-infor-
mation the players might not know, but
that the gamemaster can provide if a
successful Skill Test is made. Likewise, if
a character is in risk of running afoul of a
security system simply because the
player doesn't know better, the
gamemaster can ask for an appropriate
Knowledge Skill Test. If successful, the gamemaster can warn the
player about what the character is doing wrong in light of the
character's skills. The target numbers for these tests should be
determined from the Difficulty Numbers Table, p. 92, SR3.
Civil Engineering
Civil Engineering is the science of excavation, tunneling and
building structures. Characters skilled in this can design, plan and
oversee projects dealing with the removal of earth and stone
and the correct building of structures. It can also be used to spot
a structure's weak or strong points, or as a complementary skill
to Demolitions (p. 88, SR3) to minimize collateral damage in a
building when using explosives.
Specializations: Tunneling, Commercial Construction,
Home Construction, Industrial Construction, Excavation
Security Companies
This skill represents a character's knowledge of companies
that are wholly or partly security service providers. It covers
information on how these companies operate, the types of secu-
rity they can provide, common equipment used, the quality of
services and general information on what to expect when
encountering them, whether through legitimate means or not.
Specializations: By company
Security Design
This skill allows a character to design and/or implement a
security system. It can also allow a character to follow and pre-
dict the layout of a specific security system through observation.
It can also be used as a Complementary skill for Perception Tests
to spot hidden security devices or other security features.
Specializations: Closed Circuit Simsense, Matrix, Magical,
Physical, Corporate, Military, Private Home
Security Procedures
Security Procedures represents the character's knowledge of
standard security protocols and philosophy. This skill may be
used as a Complementary skill when dealing with security per-
sonnel to represent the familiarity with the jargon and general
security activities employed. It can also be used as a
Complementary skill for Perception Tests to spot hidden security
devices or other security features. Finally, Security Procedures
may provide an understanding of what response a security sys-
tem may take towards an intruder or alert.
Specializations: By company, Government, Military
'know, sometimes I've been accused of being humorless; cynical; maladjusted and even
overly serious. And that doesn't even touch the heartfelt missives that grace my virtual
doorstep every time I jack in. After a while, you begin to get the message.
My response to this unwarranted criticism is that shadowrunning is a serious business. If you
don't respect the dangers inherent in this livelihood, you're likely to end up as another statistic
in the daily newsfax Lone Star blotter. All the same, that doesn't mean I don't have a bead on
the lighter side of life. I can have a good time as well as the next guy. I've got my fave com-
bat biker team (Go Wolves!). I like to watch hoops once in a while. Hell, I even caught a con-
cert last month. And you'd be amazed how many trid/sim rentals I go through in a year.
It was during one of these recent relaxing culture binges that I realized that modern enter-
tainment had as much right to be in this file collection as the latest wizzer tech toys. If you have
trouble keeping pace with the state-of-the-art in electronic gizmos, the rate of change in the
music, fashion and art scenes (to name just a few of the cultural arenas our society dabbles
in) will leave your head spinning in the dust.
To highlight that concept, I've linked into a few mainstream datafeeds to commemorate
the year that was (and to look ahead to what 2063 might have to offer). To those that haven't
tried it, the entertainment industry is a boiling place for shadow work. I know many happily
(and regularly) employed individuals who don't work for any other Johnsons and prefer it that
way. Where else can you rub knuckles with the stars of stage, trid and 'Trix and get paid for it?
Not to mention the chance to make a rep that'll cast shadows across every screamsheet and
trid screen in the world.
The articles here are straight out of NewsNet and its myriad of different, yet still plastic, fla-
vors. I've left them pretty much intact, which includes the lovely ads (all residual subliminals
removed) and all that crap. This is for the benefit of those who don't get out much.
Comments, suggestions and other similar commentary can be posted after each article.
If you've got something useful, put it up. And remember, the posts here could be fiction-any
resemblance to persons living or dead may be purely coincidental. Play at your own risk.

CRITIC'S CHOICE: TOP TEN ALBUMS OF 2062
From MusicNet hostzine, Hans Grassler reporting
2062 saw an influx of popular new artists rise to challenge
the old guard, just as a few music legends returned from the
grave to shake their fans down once again. In no particular order,
here are my top ten picks of the year:
1. Talking In Circles by Andrea Frost. This stellar solo album
by Frost shows an edgy, yet ethereal, side of the famous
Concrete Dreams singer. When asked if Concrete Dreams
would be returning, Andrea flashed an enigmatic smile and
said "Wait and see." We're waiting, Andrea.
2. The Mother of the Sea by Shield Wall. After both creative
disagreements within the group and Jay Keith's three-
year recovery from a near-fatal auto accident, the long
awaited rock opera finally hit the stores in 2062. It's a
masterpiece, and the current tour is equally breathtaking.
Don't miss this one.
· Did anybody pick up on Shield Wall's "difficulties?" A friend of
mine was in the car that hit Jay K, and it wasn't an accident. It's
only too bad the idiot didn't take to the scare. The next time
won't be so gentle.
· Jackhammer
. Wow. What an utterly ineffectively way to claim glory for
something you didn't do.
· Aunt Acid
· Jackhammer is on the money. Expect Jay Keith and his band-
mates to start having some "accidents" next month. He pissed
off the wrong people with his "artistic integrity." If he hadn't stole
half the current album from Moira Thornton without credit, he
might not be having these problems.
· Concrete Dreamer
3. Time to Die by CrimeTime. This verbal ork stylist from
Vladivostok has taken the music world by storm. Time to
Die is a primal slice of synth-hop playfulness and candor,
with the grimy edge of the sprawl in every cut. His
European tour kicks off in February.
. Look out for CrimeTime to burn bright for the next six months,
then burn out altogether. Chiphead tuskers from Russia ought to
know better than to piss off the Vory for the fun of it. When he
comes home to find out what happened to his family, he's going
to crack faster than plasticrete under fire. Should be fun.
· Giorgio
4. Playing House by Erosthesia. The veteran band known for
championing alienated groups is turning to a new topic: the
Saito occupation of San Francisco. Inspired by events in their
old stomping grounds, the Haight natives are at their best
in this album. They've traded their usual deeply layered
sound for a hard minimalist arrangement that's as raw as
their lyrics and doesn't pull a single punch.
· Scrap that drek. If I want social commentary. I'll visit a SIG and
listen to people whine. You want to hear a real band, head over
to Grid Snap tonight. The Silicon Surfers are playing. Now that's
some real music, man.
· Bull
"The Best Ork Decker You Never Met!"
· Chummer! I can't believe you like the Surfers, man! They sold
out to the corp years ago-and here I thought you had taste.
Another role model, down in flames.
· Traveler Jones
· Both of you are drekwits-you don't know what you're miss-
ing with Erosthesia. And Jones, the only thing that's sold out is
your fixer to Lone Star.
"Shades of Oriental pleasure / steal across the streets / a
plague of suits and geishas / bloody hands pull up the sheets."
Erosthesia-A Plague of Shadows.
· Fan Addict
5.
Body Rhythms by Eddie Mwabe. This Rio de Janeiro native
lays down a sensual feast, with bio-synth rhythms woven
through South African and Amazonian-influenced instru-
mentals. A passionate and erotic treat.
6.
Elektron Welle by Synaptic. The bleeding-edge of Electron
Wave, these German artists have rendered up a funky, frac-
talized fiesta of sound, taking their recent sabbatical in the
PCC grids and turning that into this nova-hot album. Extra
cuts are available on their host. Check it out at Seattle LTG
206-MOBIUS.
. It's amazing that they can spare the time between their pay-
data raids on some of the local corps. That hit they made in the
PCC has both GridSec and the G-men closing in. Hell, even I'm
just waiting until the bounty gets high enough to make it worth
my while before I send the data downwind.
· Anon
. Funny name. If you knew half of what you think you do, you'd
never have dared to mention it in public. Or maybe you're just
that fried. Either way. I look forward to overlooking your obit in
the daily Shadowland "Stupid Runners Who Bit It" section. Ta.
· Earl Grey
7.
Who Calls the Nightbird Home? by Ghost Bear. This group
out of the Sioux Nation has harnessed the traditional
rhythms of their tribal ancestry and combined them with a
high-tech, high-energy trek through the Sioux Legend of
the Flute.
8.
Áltiú by Deirdre. This audacious young woman from the Tir
both embraces her elven heritage and reaches out to the
rest of the world with her debut album. The hottest cut, "Tell
Me What You Want" makes use of lyrics in both English and
French with a Sperethiel descant over the top, creating a
shimmeringly rich and surprisingly clear sound.
· Dierdre's little more than a front for the Tir. She's the latest "Oh
look, we're really friendly Elven Lords and Ladies“ drek to be
sent touring around by Surehand.
· Tulkas
· Well, what can you expect from Surehand's illegitimate
daughter?
· Spes
· Screw that, she's running for Rinelle. Just because Daddy is
Surehand doesn't make her automatically Daddy's Little Girl.
Especially after Surehand canned her mom after their affair was
over and let the two of them rot in the slums of Portland.
· Parsifal
. You believed that, did you? She's smarter than I thought.
· Spes
9. White Crowz by Plastosapiens. This CAS group knows no
limits. Fueled by the smoky voice of Chantelle Taylor and
driven by synth-bassist Johnny Bale, this album takes the
traditional sound of New Orleans's jazz clubs and turns it on
its ear with an Asian/Haitian infusion that can't be stopped.
· In other news, Plastosapiens is doing a wide-scale casting call
for runners. Seems they're tiring of the iron hold that BMG has on
them, and "contract disputes" are in the planning stages.
Available now, at a local fixer near you.
. Neon Wraith
. Y'know. Wraith, if that wasn't you saying that I'd be going out
of my way to show it up for the bulldrek it obviously is. As it is you,
however, I'll just have to wonder-how did BMG arrange to hire
you?
· Chantuse
. Why. Ms. Taylor. Didn't realize you knew your way around.
Kudos, fair lady. If you do find yourself in need of my services as
a fixer, you have but to ask.
· Gideon
10. Blazing in the Night by Melody Tyger. The follow-up to her
double-Orichalcum album, Fearful Symmetry, Dunkelzahn's
favorite recording artist has delivered a stunning perfor-
mance yet again. In a change from her previous style, this
album's cuts deal largely with meta-sexuality and genderfi-
cation issues, instead of the larger social commentary we're
used to hearing from her.
. If you want the real cutting edge of music, you won't find it
here. Every name on this list ranges somewhere between rock
star and idoru. The real groundbreaking music is in the under-
ground, in the drekhole clubs and back-grid hosts where "cul-
ture" isn't automatically associated with "credstick."

BANDWIDTH: ENHANCED PERFORMANCE
by Indra Kelly, MusicNet
These days, you can't go to a concert without being over-
whelmed by the special effects budget. The days of small inti-
mate performances in a large concert setting are long gone, and
spectacle rules the stage. Fireworks, trid screens, illusions: these
are the standard tricks of the trade, so well known that they're
only considered the basic accoutrements these days. So with
those ideas rapidly falling into the "yawn" category, how can a
performer really set herself apart?
Various groups have tried different tactics. The Silicon
Surfers are well known for their Matrix concerts, where individ-
uals can jack in and really experience the music first hand. But
what about acts that aren't so Matrix-savvy?
SIM-CASTING
In the latest tour by the nova-hot new group Hemlock, the
band held their kick-off concert in Albuquerque, in the PCC-an
odd choice until you consider the venue. They played at the
University of Pueblo, where the concert hall was wired so that
each seat had sim capability (a common capability for a theatre
showing indie trid and simsense features, along with academic
sims for group immersion learning).
As they played, a simultaneous partial sim-feed went out,
raw and uncut from the performers via cyber simrig implants.
For the audience, the sim was overlaid on top of their physical
senses, with no RAS override to limit movement or expression.
A masterpiece of emotion and adrenaline, the rave reviews and
unforeseen demand for tickets caused the band to add another
two performances in what's ordinarily considered one of the
smaller stops on a NA tour, as well as selling out the rest of their
debut tour.
The same technology has been applied to a dozen new
bands, all on the Ersatz! label. A few of them are even going for
a pre-recorded simsense show, designed specifically to enhance
their music and carry their message.
· Hey, did anyone notice that Ersatz!'s vaunted "simulcast sim
feed" has been showing up in shows by Aurica/Pollux artists?
Guess it wasn't that bleeding-edge, huh?
· Buzz
· Actually, I understand that A/P is suing Ersatz! for stealing their
tech. This one ought to be interesting.
· Legal Beagle
. As always, this has its less-than-savory side as well. One of the
most promising new bands in Seattle, Chip Truth, "broke up" only
months after signing with Ersatz !. The reality is that their lead
singer and songwriter, Doug Z, died on the operating table after
a forced implantation of the cyber simrig hardware, leading the
label to liquidate the other members to keep it quiet. Three oth-
ers on the label have died in the last year in similar tragedies-
all replaced within a couple months at most, or else the band
disappeared all together. Seems they're not bothering to ask
the band members if they want the equipment or not.
· Connie Connoisseur
.Doug Z isn't dead. He's hiding out while a street doc tries to
put his brain back together. Seems the hardware they're using
isn't exactly top-grade. I've been given to understand that
they're even handing out second-hand rigs-surprising, for a
"respectable" label like them. Especially since they're angling
for a buyout by Yamatetsu.
· Nuyen Nick
· Hey, they're just being good corporate citizens. Didn't your
mama ever teach you to recycle?
· Scag
· Something else to keep in mind: Although you're working on
a partial feed transmission, it's still the emotive track the audi-
ence is receiving-i.e., the addictive one. These can be pushed
up into California Hot range pretty easily, not to mention
beyond. A nice thing if you want to get a loyal following, or
maybe include a special message in with your entertainment.
And no recordings to catch you up later.
· Mixmaster
COFFIN CLUBBING
Another new trend is reflected in Seattle's latest club,
Psychlone. Psychlone is the first and largest of a growing num-
ber of "coffin clubs" popping up in some of the UCAS's larger
cities. It's taken a lot of years for high-profile scandals to die
down, like the band Eight Immortals and their magical audience
manipulation, but spurred on by all the magic-related hype sur-
rounding the Comet's return, Awakened entertainment is finally
enjoying a long-overdue resurgence.
The club itself looks pretty unremarkable on the surface: the
large open dance floor fronted by a small stage and surrounded
by a few tables don't look too strange, though the rows of cozy
cubicles prominently lining the walls might give the unwitting
non-magical visitor pause.
On the astral side, however, the club is transformed. This is
how it works: guests pay a cover charge and receive the key to
a "coffin"-similar to those found in coffin hotels, but cleaner and
more nicely appointed. Once inside, they lock themselves in and
leave their bodies, joining the astral crowd on and around the
dance floor. Lucius Kellraven, the club's owner and manager,
hires magical and occasional mundane acts, choosing them not
only for talent and popularity but for the sheer emotion they put
into their music. The level of energy that goes pumping through
here in the astral is incredible, giving Awakened patrons an
experience that no mundane club could hope to rival. The
younger magical set is buzzing about the new club, and reserva-
tions are considered a must. Psychlone is rapidly becoming the
hottest Awakened scene in Seattle, something that has the mon-
eymen buzzing too.
· Coffin clubs are a good place for astral meets-everybody's
so busy experiencing the music that they don't pay any atten-
tion to your little group off talking in the corner.
· Silicon Mage
· Something they didn't mention in the article is security. Coffin
clubs employ powerful wards to ensure no one gets in without
paying, and equally powerful bouncers-usually a mix of magi-
cians and spirits-to deter anyone from causing trouble. A club
in Boston barely averted a scandal a few months ago when a
group of shedim spirits tried to take over some unoccupied
bodies. Since then security has been a particularly high priority.
· Winterhawk
o I've heard that if you're a VIP (that is, if you pay enough) you
can leave your body somewhere else and they'll let you
through the wards.
· Serena
· Doesn't this strike anybody as a bad idea? You're going to go
astral and leave your body under someone else's wards in the
care of people you don't know? No thank you.
· Prickly Pear
· Hmmm. You're right. Permit me an evil cackle as I ponder the
possibilities.
· Faust
TOP TEN TRIDS AND SIMS FROM 2062
From Simphile Matrix Zine, John Digles reporting
2062 was a record-breaking year, with Dragonsclaw break-
ing the three billion nuyen barrier in home and box office
receipts, and each of these top-ten grossing over one billion.
1. Dragonsclaw, an ArtHaus PolyPOV sim starring Elise
Nirveau and Benjamin Beals. The year's hottest action-
adventure flick. Set in the Ukraine, a team of field operatives
from the CAS and UCAS must stop a dragon gone mad and
defuse the nuclear bombs set in its lair before it destroys the
planet.
***
· | understand that Elise Nirveau's getting a little tired of both
ArtHaus and ol' Benji. Seems that 12 sims together is enough for
her taste, but they won't let her out of her contract. And Benji's
a bit ... possessive.

2.
Stardust and Angelwing,
a Dreamcatcher Studios sim star-
ring Angela Bower and Sharise
D'Anjou. A family film for all ages
and an instant classic. A dysfunc-
tional corporate family is taught to
love again through the intervention
of two heavenly spirits. *****
3.
Dearly Beloved, a sim
from GTC Productions, starring Sir
Anthony Taylor. A reclusive elven
mage dies and comes back from
the dead, possessed by an evil spir-
it. Driven by unholy lust, the crea-
ture sets out to claim the mage's
former love, reborn into the body
of a beautiful young woman.

4.
Eclipse, a PolyPOV sim
from DeMeKo starring Matthew
Keller, Evanna Ni Berran, Kurt
Tusker, and Kelly Esperanza. A
space station faces attack by a mys-
terious group of saboteurs as the
crew races against time in an effort
to divert a comet headed for the
Earth. ****
5.
Flat Beer and Moonpies,
a blockbuster indie trid starring
Alex Gracchi, Danylle Kayne, and
Elian Eagle Feather. A young man
from rural Texas faces the choice of
pursuing his dreams of a career in
music or accepting his responsibili-
ties and taking over the family busi-
ness. *****

Streets of Rage, a new
Yamatetsu Productions PolyPOV

editing old sim recordings and press footage until they can get
her back.

7. Corp Script, an "indie" trid from ABS, starring Patrice Kim
and Leon Sobieski. A young corporate secretary falls in love
with a down-and-out thief and rehabilitates him, landing
him a job as a lounge singer in the Corp Residential
Entertainment District. An offbeat comedy with a dark sense
of humor. *
· Speaking of hot babes, did anyone see Patrice Kim in Corp
Script? Daaa-mn. That red dress she wears in the last scene
would look great crumpled on my floor.

· What the frag? You mean you actually watched that piece
of corporate propaganda? Damn, I come here to Shadowland

· Well no kidding, joyboy. It was an excellent film, and some of
us actually have appearances to keep up. Get over yourself.

. And as a point, if the corps had actually backed the film, don't
you think it would have rated higher than 3 1/2 stars? I mean,
look at the piece of drek that was Stardust and Angelwing. It
sucked so badly that no amount of vacuum could have saved
it. But it keeps the nice little wage-slaves happy and content, so
UP goes the ratings. If it hadn't had that "famous" scene where
you could feel D'Anjou brushing by and holding the kid
between her breasts in a "motherly" embrace, it would have
tanked altogether. As it is, though, it ranks five stars. Rillight.

8.
Star Brother Hunts the Sun, a PolyPOV sim from Orion's
Belt Studios starring Julian Little Bear and Kathleen Clear
Sky. A young Dine woman falls in love with a Sioux man
against the wishes of both their families. An updated and
stylish retelling of the Romeo and Juliet story with a tribal
twist.
9. Elemental Endgame, a PolyPOV animated sim-feature from
Quark Studios, starring the voice talent and sim impressions
of Maggie Methane and Steven La Rouche. This is a mas-
terpiece of technical effort, incorporating live sim recordings
with entirely digital visuals and yet keeping true to both for-
mats. The sim tracks during the main zero-G battle between
Methane and the Fire Elemental are mind-blowing.

10. Dia de los Muertos, a PolyPOV sim also from New Star star-
ring Rebecca Inglit and Toby Sirhan. This detective thriller is
loosely based on the infamous Vampire Stalker cases in San
Francisco in the late 2030s. Inglit and Sirhan play the detec-
tives who finally track down the killer. ***
. Rebecca Inglit doesn't just play a chiphead on occasion, she
actually is one. Her real name was Jane Simpson, and she was
a chippie in a bunraku parlor two years ago. New Star wanted
a new actress on the cheap, so they cleaned her up and gave
her a new chip to slot. Talk about art imitating life.

"Greed IS Good!"
VIRTUAL LIGHT AND MAGIC
by Juno Mclvens, for ArtScene hostzine
In the last decade, a new artistic movement has started
that breaks the mold of what has come before. Instead of shap-
ing and applying techniques in the physical world, Matrix
artists mold, color and shade the virtual world to suit their
desires. These works of art exist solely in the Matrix, where
exhibitions have broken local host usage records and attracted
fans by the thousands.
The movement began underground, but in the past few
years it has seen a growing emergence among the avant-garde.
When the Renraku Gallery in Los Angeles hosted the first-ever
wholly Matrix-based exhibit of Vaslav Smenko's work earlier this
past June, entitled "Comet Dust Viruses," the art form exploded
onto the scene with a vengeance. Unfortunately, so have the
forged copies of his works; a situation that has led to Smenko
suing the Richards Gallery for material damages.
One of the brightest stars in the virtual firmament is Roberto
Wauneka, a 22-year-old member of the Zuni tribe in the Pueblo
Corporate Council. Roberto is breaking Matrix attendance
records with his current show, "Eagle and Coyote," on exhibit at
the Governor's Gallery in Santa Fe. When we caught up with
Roberto there, we asked him about the security risks.
"The art I create isn't really any less secure than any other
application or sculpt you'd normally see," Roberto told us. "I cus-
tom designed not only the sculpts, but the applications and lan-
guage variations that I use to create the sculpts. It makes crack-
ing and reverse engineering the sculpts pretty difficult."
Roberto's show will be open from May 14th through July
25th, at Albuquerque's Kachina Gallery on Osuna Blvd.

· Rose Red

actually really sweet.
· Firebird
. We've played with them a bit. Nice work, with an original
angle on the security. We give it a 5.4 on technical merit while
abstaining on the artistic expression score. Not all of us are into
the tribal look.

· Want a Wauneka original? Drop me a note. Reasonable
prices, fast service.
· Raider
· Yeah, your copies are as "original" as Krill King's last collec-
table cup. All this is small potatoes. The real money is in liberat-
ing true originals and replacing them with forgeries, then col-
lecting your fee or selling them off to the highest bidder.
Whether it's in the real shadows or the virtual ones, rich collec-
tors love putting the shaft to their competition, and they'll pay
well to do it. God. I love my work.

SWEET SPOTS: 2062'S TOP 10 SCENES
by Wally Nguyen, from Indie Spotlight hostzine
All work and no play makes any reporter sloppy after a
while, so I was really happy to see this assignment come my
way. We took a poll of our affiliate offices across North America
to determine for you, our reader, which nightspots were the ten
best on the continent. Let me assure you that no amount of man-
power was considered too great to devote to this story. Some of
the most dedicated investigative reporting I've ever seen pro-
vided you with these names. After the polling was completed, a
friend and I set out on the ultimate trip across North America, bar
hopping and city hopping at the same time.
Several
bail
hearings, stomach
pumps and blackout
periods later, our
research
was
declared finished
and the winners
were chosen. The
finalists were all too
spectacular in their
own ways to possi-
bly compare, so
there is no particular
order of precedence
set within the top
ten. We invite you
to check out any (or
all) of this year's
entries. I'm pretty
sure you won't be
disappointed.
1. Whiskey Sour-
Dee Cee, UCAS. The
bar looks like some-
thing out of an
1800's gentleman's club, complete with leather chairs, a beauti-
ful maple bar, carefully chosen artwork and soft classical music in
the background, just the right level for conversation. The colors
in the bar are rich burgundies and browns, setting an "old
money" feel for the place. The help is elegantly dressed and
helpful, and the drinks are very, very good.
The crowd here is mostly suits and politicos, but anyone
who can dress the part is made to feel welcome. If you're in the
mood for a calm, relaxing drink in a place that looks like a pow-
ermonger's wet dream, this is definitely the bar for you.
2. Purgatory Central-Atlanta, CAS. This hot new club is quick-
ly becoming one of the big new dance scenes in the Atlanta
sprawl. Located downtown, it's the first international venture by
the owners of the famous Dante's Inferno in Seattle.
Just like its older sister, Purgatory has nine levels of dance
floors. The themes are a bit more twenty-first century, with an
astral level, a Matrix level, a sprawi level, a level for each ele-
ment (air, wind, fire, water) and two more still to open. The pri-
vate rooms are down below, and the owner's parties are con-
sidered one of the hottest tickets in town-if you're invited,
you're definitely somebody.
For those of us with lesser connections, however, the club is
still an excellent time. Each level has hot live music on a differ-
ent night, ensuring that there's always something new to see.
The staff is helpful, but the music level makes it hard to commu-
nicate what you want sometimes, especially if you're ordering
during one of the live music sets. Still, the drinks are good, with
a great selection of on-tap beer, both top-end soy and authentic,
as well as some of the most skilled bartenders in town.
3. Emerald-New Orleans, CAS. The bars and nightclubs on
Bourbon Street are legendary, but this new venture stands out
even in such a swank crowd. Emerald is owned by Elenor
LaGrasse, a musical patron with a New Orleans pedigree as long
as her arm. Nobody but the best jazz players gets a gig at this
club, and she personally oversees operations here nightly.
This club sells food as well as drink, and the cuisine here is
as good as any restaurant in town- and in New Orleans, that's
saying a lot. They carry a lot of imported liquors, including high-
end scotch from the UK, ale and wine from the Tirs and some
exotic beers and rum from the Caribbean League. If you have a
taste for the unusual, you'll undoubtedly find it here. The atmos-
phere is casual, and the staff is friendly. Definitely for those who
appreciate the finer things in life.
· If you're in New Orleans and need a score or a job, go to
Emerald and ask for Genevieve. She's Elenor's personal secre-
tary as well as being one of the best fixers in town (with her
boss's support). Oh, and one more thing: Genevieve is a knock-
out, but don't even go there. Her relationship with Elenor is
more than just professional, if you know what I mean, and she
won't work with anyone who can't keep their mind on the job
at hand.
· Ghede
0 | hear they serve a few concoctions that go beyond the
exotic-I'm talking alchemical elixirs and potions. They ain't
cheap and you may not get what you asked for, but it's worth
the experience.
· Leary
4. Pulsar-Albuquerque, PCC. When you think of the PCC, you
think probably think of adobe and desert and stuff with feathers
or blankets or something on it. The club called Pulsar not only
proves such antiquated ideas wrong, it practically moons you
and says unkind things about your parents for being so stupid.
Everything about this club is bleeding-edge, from the sound
system to the lighting, with a heavy industrial feel to the whole
bar. Plasteel, aluminum, brushed chrome and synth-rubber give
a rough, dangerous feel to the place while high-tech light and
trid shows dazzle the senses.
The dress code here is "anything that your mother would
have a heart-attack to see you in." In other words, if you're
cybered, chromed, leathered, latexed or otherwise ready to show
your assets, you've got the right look. The waitstaff aren't known
for their patience, but they really deliver the goods if you know
what you want. The drinks are expensive, but distinctive-you
can be sure that no one else is serving anything quite like them.
· If you end up in the PCC, go to Pulsar. The owner, Lazer, has
some amazing connections. He can get you anything cyber for
half of what you'll pay somewhere else. He can even hook you
up with a god doc to install it for you. He'll also let you work part
of it off, if you don't have the cred for the whole thing.
· Gearshift
· That description alone makes me want to run far, far away.
Haven't you ever heard that if it sounds too good to be true, it's
because there's someone behind you waiting to use you for tar-
get practice and search your pockets after you fall for it? Unless,
of course, you're in it with him. Then it all makes perfect sense.
· Skeptic
5. Altitude-Denver. When you're looking for laid-back atmos-
phere with a hint of icy cool attitude, this bar is the place to go.
Centered in the heart of the downtown district, people from all
sections of the city congregate here for an atmosphere nowhere
else in Denver can match. This place is decorated in colors that
bring to mind the mountaintops that the area is famous for: dark
granite grays on floor, seats and counters, with iridescent white
as an accent and hints of blue to tease the eye. Lighting is kept
thankfully dim and there's no dance floor to distract from the
conversation. Dress is casual, attitude is minimal and real beer
and spirits are plentiful. A definite must-visit.
· Word is that Nicholas Whitebird takes a breather here once in
a while when he's not running errands for the Big White Wyrm.
· Zak
6. Al Coda-Boston, UCAS. Always wanted to go to Europe but
don't have the cred? This is as close as you can get without hav-
ing to get on a big shiny passenger bullet to get there. Boston
has always had that "old world" feel, and this bar really plays that
up. It's full of quiet alcoves for conversation, and also has half a
dozen private rooms available for rent. The upstairs is home to a
much more modern dance floor and live music arena. A number
of nova groups have chosen the place for a small, intimate venue
when in town, so keep your eyes open. We ended up attending
an outstanding (and rare) acoustical performance by Darwin's
Bastards when we were there, something I'll be able to tell my
mythical grandchildren about someday.
Drink prices are reasonable across the board, with higher-
priced alternatives for those who want something with a little
more style. No food available here, but who needs it? What are
you waiting for, an engraved invitation? Go!
7. ?!?- New York City, UCAS. Y'know, it's been almost sixty
years since the Big One hit NYC, and the Five Boroughs still
aren't the same. You can't really find much evidence of it in
Manhattan now, aside from a memorial that will leave you gasp-
ing, but it's still there. The biggest evidence of this is that the
once-priciest-real-estate-on-the-continent still hasn't fully come
back. An exception to this is ?!? , the new club on 61st Street
(known locally as "that club on 61st Street") that proves that
style never left the city, whatever its detractors might think.
NYC still attracts its share of celebs, and coming here on a
good night is like a walk among the stars. The line gets really
long after about 7:30, so come early or wear comfortable shoes.
The decorating is bold and whimsical, in black and white and
punctuation wherever you go. (The bathrooms are really cool.
Really.) Oh, and don't expect to come out of here with a lot of
your paycred left. Atmosphere costs, you know?
8. The Gaslight-Los Angeles, PCC. The City of Angels is built
on dreams, and the owners of Gaslight know that better than any-
one. Owned by former sim star Angel Seraphim, the place
exudes 1940's film noir, making you feel as though you just
stepped into some black-and-white suspense flick with deadly
dames and hard-boiled heroes that smoke too much and have no
fashion sense. No dance floor here but that's okay, 'cause the
execs that come here don't come to dance. Hard drinks are the
specialty here, with vodka, scotch and gin all at the top of the list.
Waitstaff are all ultra-friendly and looking for their first big break.
Look for the old movie memorabilia in the entry, it's a kick.
9. Shinpi no Sekal-San Francisco, California Protectorate. San
Fran's was heavily Japan-a-influenced for years before Saito
arrived. This club celebrates that fact by pulling out all the stops.
Walking into this place is like diving headfirst into a Japanese-
inspired pool of reflection. This multi-floored establishment takes
its cue from some of the more reputable pleasure houses in
Tokyo. The bar is open to anyone, while the bathhouse and pri-
vate rooms require a yearly membership. Needless to say, orien-
tal drinks are the specialty of the house, with more types of sake
than you can shake a chopstick at. They have more familiar liba-
tions too-a wasabi martini is the hit of the house, if you can
believe it.
· No surprise, but a lot of those bath-goers have some really
detailed tattoo-work, from back pieces to full-body inks-and
it's not just cuz they appreciate body art, If you know what I
mean.
· Lotus Eater
10. The Strip-Las Vegas, Ute. It's Las Vegas, baby! This is a
hotel bar, actually, but don't hold that against it. Everything
about this place says class, with just a hint of that Casino Royale
ambiance. Don't let the gold leaf fool you, though. This is a place
where movers and shakers move and shake, and we aren't just
talking about the showgirl waitresses.
On the ground floor of the Plaza Hotel, the crowd here
changes nightly. The only regulars are the staff, but they still pro-
vide an intimate atmosphere with enough glitz to make it spe-
cial. Rounded booths make for quiet conversational nooks, and
that famous Vegas nightclub music pipes softly from the back-
ground, including live feeds from some of the bigger shows
when they're in town. Prices are reasonable, and the staff excels
at making everyone feel comfortable and welcome.
· Is anyone else pissed that Club Penumbra was left out? It's still
the hottest thing going and always has the best music in town.
· Sonic
Give it a rest already. Have you actually looked at Club
Penumbra lately? The owners haven't put any money into the
club in years. It's ratty, the carpet's coming up in spots and the
lighting is stale. Yeah, it's a great place to go hear music, but if
it weren't for the hope of surprise Concrete Dreams appear-
ances, the place would have gone under years ago.
· Seattle Sue
· Actually, it's about to go under a major facelift. Jake Hokama
died and left it to his son, Kevin, who is all about bringing the
club into the 2060s. Don't worry, though, he's keeping the
theme the same. Estimates put the cost for the rehab at close
to 750,000¥, paid for up front by Kevin.
· Connie Connoisseur
· Where did he get that kind of money? The club doesn't do
that well.
· Joey
. Let's see. Club P is a favorite of shadowrunners; Concrete
Dreams views the place as their own personal home away from
home and Jake was one of the most beloved old bastards on
Shadowland, even though he never set foot on the grids. Gee, I
don't know where Kevin could have come up with the money.

THE 'TRIX-STER REPORT
by Cara Oke, Trix-ster hostzine
Hola, omae, and welcome to this week's Trix-ster Report.
Today we're going to take a look at 2062 in review, the best sto-
ries that the Grids had to offer.
. Best Scandal Involving a Major Corporate Player:
UOL's continued denial of illegal "personal services" for sale
came unraveled this last March, when UCAS Feds received a
tip leading them to a sysop-only virtual chat room. It seems
that with the right connections (and the right cred limits) a UOL
user could arrange any number of simsense encounters with a
bevy of willing virtual beauties, regardless of age, metatype or
style of pleasure.
The scam was sprung when missing funds from the
Republican Party were traced to a holding account at UOL.
Allegations that former Vice President and presidential hopeful
James Booth was involved in both the transfer of funds and vir-
tual body fluids in the sim prostitution ring were gleefully proven
when the Feds caught Booth red-handed-er, you get the idea-
engaging in "conversation" with a virtual "hostess."
The executives at UOL deny any knowledge of the opera-
tion, blaming it squarely on the shoulders of a trio of enterpris-
ing middle-management types. Still, it makes you wonder how
so much bandwidth could go unnoticed for so long, as well as
where all the cash from the venture ended up.
. I have to say that it cracked me the frag up when UOL got
busted for their little virtual party room. Did you know that it was
hidden under a SIG on gardening, of all things? It gives "hoe,
hoe, hoe" a whole new meaning.
· A. J.
· Ow. That was so wrong and yet so right. Hurt me again, baby.
· Spudly
. Since they reported on this newsflash, two of the three defen-
dants have gone missing. One is suspected dead, while the other
is still on the run from authorities. The third is in protective custody.
Anyone want to take bets on how long number three lasts?
· Grim
. Best Vandalism Without a Clue: All through "comet sea-
son," the grids were alive with kiddies and pranksters who left
comet graffiti lying around every host dumb enough not to have
an automatic dump sequence. Occasionally something more
serious would come up, but not often. Then in November, a big
hit went down. The Knight Errant host icon actually vanished
from the grid entirely, all access severed. It didn't reappear for
six hours, enough time for any 'Trixter worth his access to notice
and poke around.
After intensive investigative reporting, we discovered that
when the Knight Errant host disconnected, it did so in a defen-
sive move designed to trap a group of vandals that had attacked
the host. Apparently the unidentified individuals were trying to
literally rebuild the system in areas from the ground up.
The kicker, of course, is that KE is hardly undefended. It
took a long battle, but in the end the invaders were repulsed or
forced to jack out. The KE deckers were able to salvage the host
structure intact. Rumor suggests that KE was warned in advance
of the attack and had extra techs assigned to rebuild the dam-
age as it occurred, but Knight Errant isn't saying one way or the
other. Two of the vandals were killed, while KE suffered only
minor losses.
· Best Scandal Involving a Wanna-be: Remember sim star
Yumiko Hime? Remember her interview last June with Sim Scene
regarding her upcoming simflick, The Seven Deadly Virtuals
about a computer host that achieves sentience and sets out to
kill the senior programmer's girlfriend? Remember how she
revealed for the first time in that interview that she was actually
otaku, and had grown up in the Compi Lar tribe in the Noose
Net? I thought you would.
We remained unconvinced by Yumiko's claim, to say the
least, so we set out to prove it once and for all. After weeks of
searching, we did manage to locate the Compi Lar tribe, though
they wouldn't talk to us at first. It took weeks more of negotia-
tion before they'd discuss Yumiko with us, but finally they broke.
The truth was even more fun than the fiction.
Yumiko, it seems, had a cousin who ended up a member of
the tribe. When she told her agent, they decided to offer the tribe
a substantial payment in advance for the right to claim Yumiko
was one of theirs. The big problem is that Yumiko made the claim
a month earlier than scheduled, and that payment never came. It
seems the only hold-up in agreeing to talk to us was a faint hope
on the part of the tribe's leaders that the studio would come
through. Needless to say, the studio didn't see it that way.
Since we broke the story, Yumiko has been fired from the
project for "artistic differences," and the studio has shed several
top execs like last year's supermodels. The flick now stars
Chrissie Raey, and the reviews so far are outstanding. Oh, and I
wouldn't feel too bad for the otaku tribe in the Noose, either. We
got the impression they could handle themselves just fine.
· Best Tech-to-the-Masses Invention: The Sim-Vironment,
put out by Global Technologies. Appearing soon at a high-end
entertainment complex near you, the Sim-Vironment takes the
sim experience one step further. Without giving away too many
trade secrets, it functions as a plain room that is transformed
through the wonders of simsense technology to function as any
kind of environment you wish (the choices conform to the basic
physical characteristics of the room).
The inhabitants of the room (either through wireless 'trodes
or 'jacks) are able to interact with both each other and the envi-
ronment simultaneously, physically moving throughout the
room to accomplish whatever actions are necessary to move
through the storyline provided. The scenarios can accommodate
up to five people at once and take anywhere from an hour and
a half to three hours to complete. Don't worry about running out
of scenarios either, as the CEO of Global Technologies has
announced that new scenarios are due to be released at the rate
of three every six months.
The real kicker of the Sim-Vironment is that it carefully layers
sensory impressions without driving you batty at the same time.
It doesn't require the least amount of Matrix-savvy to enjoy the
ride, and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to play, either.
. Has it occurred to anyone else how much could be done with
a Sim-Vironment and the right program? You could carry inter-
rogation techniques to a whole new level.
· Cleo
· And that's just the beginning. If you can get to it, take a gan-
der at the research data Global Technologies has been hoard-
ing on this "entertainment center" of theirs. It's impressive, but I
don't think I'll be booking a birthday party with them anytime
soon. Call me paranoid.
· Neon Wraith
· Best New 'Trix-n-Treats Hot Spot: This category was real-
ly the most subjective of any, but the answer I got from every-
one was unanimous: Grid Snap, in the Downtown Seattle LTG
(206-52-7289). While there are some venerable Matrix clubs out
there, this one provides a whole new reason to get a datajack in
and of itself. With bleeding-edge programming and simfeeds,
this is a place where nearly anything goes (and they've got pri-
vate rooms, too). From dancing to drinking, games to drama,
Grid Snap has everything you could want on a Saturday night
without the hassle of finding parking or standing in line.
The ambience and decorating schemes are drawn (hee)
from old drafting programs. Everything looks like a blueprint
with little measurements and hash marks included. The virtual
staff play along with this theme in their personas as well, making
for some interesting waitress and waiter icons.
At the same time, despite seeming so grounded in reality,
this place is all about bending the rules of the real world, from
physics to chemistry and everything in between. The owners and
designers have knocked themselves out to make sure that every-
thing you experience at Grid Snap will be unequalled in the
physical world, and that going to a real bar will pale by compar-
ison. While I'm not sure this is an entirely attainable goal, the
repeated visits by members of the 'Trix-ster staff seem to indi-
cate that something good is going on there.
THE RACE FOR THE OLYMPICS
by Inigo Amman, Sports Today! hostzine
The race to host the 2072 Winter Olympics heated up today
as three more bids were added. Yamatetsu, Tir Tairngire and
Quebec have all put together serious packages for consideration
by the IOC, though Yamatetsu's bid in particular is stirring up a
lot of controversy.
For many years, megacorporations have used their extrater-
ritorial status to invoke privileges usually reserved for nations.
Over the course of the last half-century, corporate citizenship has
become both commonplace and sought-after, as corporate citi-
zens typically enjoy a high standard of living and significant pros-
perity as compared to the standard national citizen. Still, most
megacorporations maintain that they are not nations, preferring
to keep the two entities distinct. At least, until now.
If Yamatetsu were to secure the bid, it would mean a great
deal of prestige for the company-a public relations coup of the
first water. It would also significantly blur the line between mega-
corp and nation, a line that has grown thinner every year. It
remains to be seen, however, if the IOC will seriously consider
the bid.
In other Olympic news, the Salish-Shidhe Council has sus-
pended the head of the SSC Olympic Committee, Charles Red
Elk, over alleged mismanagement of funds. The suspension of
Red Elk has seriously hampered efforts to sell the Seattle-SSC bid
for the 2072 games. IOC officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, consider the scandal to have materially damaged the
nations' chances of winning the bid. No representatives of the
Seattle-SSC Olympic Committee could be reached for comment.
· The Seattle-SSC bid for the games was an unheard-of arrange-
ment, with the UCAS and SSC sharing hosting privileges for the
bid. It might have heralded a new diplomatic era between the
two nations, but it looks like it's dead in the water now.
· Seattle Sue
· Well I wonder who we can blame for the sudden cooling of
relations. The PCC? Sioux? Or your favorite and mine, Tsimshian?
The last thing they want is a chummier UCAS and SSC, espe-
cially while this little border war is escalating.
· Smiley
. Or maybe that's what they want you to think.

SPORT NEWS: THE 2062 RECAP
by the staff of Sports Today! hostzine
BASEBALL
July 2062: Party-boy pitcher Mike Dutton of the Chicago
White Sox has been outted as an adept in a press conference by
NAL spokesperson Julia Weiss. Mike confessed to the charges,
saying that the franchise knew of his abilities and hired him any-
way. The team manager, lan Yamaguchi, allegedly used Dutton's
minor cybernetic modifications to keep the media from suspect-
ing anything while Dutton maintained his cover by masking his
magical aura. The owners of the White Sox deny the allegations,
but the results of the investigation are still pending in one of the
messiest Chicago scandals in years.
The Denver Ghosts made their first appearance in the
league's Central Division. Their opening season showed promise
of a solid team for 2063, with 65 wins and 96 losses for the sea-
son. Manager Manuel Clemente is quoted as saying, "We're very
excited about the changes both in Denver and in the team as a
whole, and we look forward to making an even better showing
next season."
BASKETBALL
January 2062: The lead story for the year in basketball is the
ongoing controversy with the Golden State Warriors. Golden
State has always carried a meta-heavy team, boasting one of the
highest recruiting ratios in the NABA. Suddenly, however, most
of the metahuman players are receiving little, if any, time on the
boards. Even elven star forward Evan Kresler, the leading scorer
for the Warriors and formerly averaging 24 points a game, is
barely seeing the floor-less than five minutes per half. When
Warriors coach Aaron Wu was asked about the changes, he
refused to comment. It seems obvious, however, that the roster
changes coincide with the political change in their home, San
Francisco. Protests have become more intense with each home
game, with 44 injured last weekend.
COMBAT BIKER
August 2062: The Commandos have new life, and the play-
offs look to be in sight for the first time in years. With a new
coach and a new strategy, the Commandos defeated the
Marauders in an incredible shutout game, 15-0. Alina Bowman,
linebiker for the Commandos, set a new team record for the
most meters carried in a single game. During the entire time the
Commandos attacked the flag aggressively at every opportuni-
ty, claiming it for their own and daring anyone to stop them.
Their coach, Augustus Vega, said, "This is a new team, with a
new attitude and a new style of play. Forget what came before,
because we're going all the way now."
. The Commandos' new attitude is because they're hopped
up on kamikaze. Charlie Bravo's the local supplier, and he's
making a killing off them.
· Buzz
· What are you, kidding? It's obvious it's magic. I'm amazed the
league hasn't investigated yet.
· Magister
· Who's to say they haven't? The team is lined up for the Biker
Bowl. You don't expose them the day of the big game if you
haven't been able to prove it before then. Too much money on
the line.

DRONE FOOTBALL
July 2062: The Montreal Mécanicien won the second annu-
al NADF Championship yesterday by a score of 27-13 over the
Detroit Rustbelts. The franchise had been in serious financial
straits earlier in the year after it was discovered that an ex-
employee had embezzled hundreds of thousands of nuyen from
team accounts. Cross Industries purchased the team mid-season,
allowing them to continue as a member of the league. When
asked about his team's victory, Lucien Cross said, "Everyone
enjoys backing a winner. My congratulations to the team mem-
bers and management."
FOOTBALL
January 2063: Representatives of three teams in the
Freedom League presented a petition today to the league
commissioners for the inclusion of changelings. SURGE
spawned a league controversy in early 2062 when disaster
struck Tampa Bay Buccaneers star receiver Tracy Keller. One of
the few leading sports figures affected by SURGE, Keller was
transformed into a changeling with elongated, extra-jointed
arms and digitigrade legs.
Never one to quit, Keller rallied, recovering from his ordeal
and getting back into the game with flying colors. Keller's
changes proved quite useful to his game, a fact that was not
unnoticed by league officials, who disqualified individuals affect-
ed by SURGE from competition. Keller and the Buccaneers have
appealed the decision, and they are now joined by the Houston
Oilers and New Orleans Saints.
· Humanis-linked hate groups have made threats against
Freedom League games if changelings are allowed to play.
Large crowds always make me nervous.

HOCKEY
December 2062: With six plus months to go until the
Stanley Cup, the ice hockey world exploded in this month with
news of game fixing and corruption. The Red Wings new star
goalie, Peter Nguyen, was brought up on charges today of
game fixing following the collapse of fellow team member
Leroy van Buren on the ice. Van Buren is listed in serious con-
dition at DocWagon-St. Mark's Hospital in Detroit, suffering
from a near-fatal reaction to an unknown chemical compound.
Nguyen claims innocence, but traces of an unknown chemical
were found among his possessions. Nguyen's arraignment is
set for tomorrow.
HOT STUFF ON THE ICE: THE NEW CALGARY FLAMES
by Jill Nelson, Sports Zine hostzine
After last year's catastrophic season for the Flames, conventional wisdom said that
there was no way the AMC team could make any headway this year. The '61-'62 sea-
son left the Flames near the bottom of the standings after the deaths of three key play-
ers. Those players, Running Bear, Onique and Lang, died in a plane crash outside of
Montreal following the November 14th game in that city. All taken together, it added up
to an almost insurmountable obstacle.
Fast forward to this year. The Flames are currently in the running for a play-off
berth, leading the Northwest Division and running second in their conference overall.
Their performance has stunned spectators and opponents alike, leaving everyone won-
dering, "How did they turn this around?"
The answer lies in Coach Justin Cloudwing's unique approach to the off-season
break. "I wanted them to remember their teammates without carrying their grief back
into the game. To achieve that, some elders were kind enough to perform the funeral
rituals for us, letting us send our pain and grief away and instead, to be blessed by the
spirits of our fellow warriors."
Whatever Coach Cloudwing did, it sure seems to have had an effect. Karoski, the
team captain, said, "I really didn't agree with the coach, but I can tell there's been a big
change since the rituals. It's almost as though you can feel them out on the ice with us."
Comments like those have raised some alarms with suspicious opponents, but the NHL's
investigative magicians have cleared the team of any suspicious activity. The official
statement says that the rituals were religious in nature, not magical, and thus have not
compromised the integrity of the organization.
· Y'know, in looking at the article on the Flames, you have to think
that whoever set up the hit is pretty pissed about now. Here they
go to all the trouble of having the top three players killed, only to
have the team come back again the next season playing as well
or better.
· Argent
· You think it was a hit? Any idea who might have been behind it?
· Cutter
· Cloudwing was bucking really hard against the way the franchise
owners were treating the players. I'd put my money on them, as they
can't legally get rid of him until he has two losing seasons in a row
and he's too high-profile just to disappear. They don't want to cre-
ate a martyr, just get rid of an annoyance.

SOCCER
October 2062: The Cheyenne Coyotes have again
suffered another run of bad luck. Players Dane Abby,
Raphael Lorange and 2051 league MVP winner Marcel
Kuns have been removed from the roster permanently,
following unsuccessful implant surgeries. The
spokesperson for the Coyotes says, "We are saddened
by the loss of Abby, Lorange and Kuns. They are not only
our teammates, but our friends as well." Official sources
from the club indicate that the trio were undergoing
standard reflex modification surgery. Sioux officials are
conducting an investigation into the deaths, but have
not issued a statement at this time.

that's a crock. Those records were doctored (and not
very well); the implants were fine.

April 2062: The much-anticipated game between
the Santa Fe Coyotes and the Phoenix Kachinas was
rescheduled last Sunday after a bomb threat forced
officials to clear the stadium. The PCC Conference
Center in Santa Fe was the site of the attack. An anony-
mous call came in roughly an hour before game time,
at 3:15 MDT. The caller claimed that a bomb had been
placed in the building. PCC Security teams exhaustive-
ly searched the building and found four mini-charges in
the basement of the stadium.

shadowed, however, by the arrest of the Havana heavy Ricardo
Rodriguez. Authorities have indicated that Rodriguez is a suspect
in the murder of his former wife and their three children on
September 21st. Rodriguez is currently being held without bail.

CHRISTMAS AMONG THE STARS: SHIBANOKUJI FREEFALL
RESORT
by Ethan Marquet
What do you get for the person who has everything?
Another yacht? Hardly. A jeweled nightie? Boring. A gold-plat-
ed datajack with diamond studs? Yawn. It's the eternal question
for those with nuyen to burn and time on their hands. And every
year, when that gift-giving time rolls around and we all pull out
our credsticks, we go through the same struggle all over again.
This year, Yamatetsu brings you an answer.
STICKBALL: RULES OF THE GAME
The Native American game a-ne-jo-di (or "stickball") resembles lacrosse,
but only on the surface. It is a rough, unstructured game that focuses on ath-
leticism and stamina, with both men's and women's versions of the sport. It is
played on an open field with the goal placed in the center. It is definitely a con-
tact sport, with many injured each year. There are very few rules, leading to a
freeform and exciting style of play. The rules listed here are for organized com-
petition play only, and may not be applicable to games being played as part of
a religious ceremony.
The game is played in two thirty-minute periods with a five-minute break
in between. Two replacement players are allowed per game. If a player is
injured, the conjuror of the team (see below) immediately applies magical
healing on the sidelines.
The goal of a-ne-jo-di is to score the greatest number of points. Injuries
are common, especially among the men's leagues.
Equipment
The basic equipment for a-ne-jo-di consists of a small hard ball and a ball
stick. The ball is traditionally made of deer hair and hide, a combination that
is still used when the game is played for religious purposes. Competition balls
are made of tightly wrapped cord with a leather cover.
In addition, men's leagues use two ball sticks, each a little over 60 cen-
timeters in length. The sticks are traditionally handmade of hickory. The end is
hooked, with leather lacings across the loop to form a net. While these sticks are
still used in ceremonial games, the competition ball sticks are made from wood,
lightweight metals or plastics. Women's leagues use their hands instead of sticks.
Apparel for the game consists of light shirts, shorts and athletic shoes as
well as lightly padded leather gloves for the women.
Players
In each competition game there are two teams with twelve players on
each side. There are no formalized positions such as offense or defense;
instead, every player is expected to do both as needed. The only set positions
aside from the players are those of the officiating priest and the conjurors.
The officiating priest is necessary for every game, regardless of its offi-
cial competitive standing. He or she opens the game by tossing the ball into the
field and is responsible for stopping the game if necessary for injured players.
He also ensures that everyone stays true to the nature of the game, and offers
the opening prayers.
The conjurors function in much the same manner as coaches do in other
sports, but their role in a-ne-jo-di is far more pro-active. The conjurors are
traditionally shamans who specialize in health spells. They are responsible
for leading their team to victory and are allowed to enchant their players as
desired in order to achieve that goal. Conjurors are not allowed to magically
affect the opposing team's players, the ball or the playing field. Spirits are
not allowed to play on the team.
Magic is prized in a-ne-jo-di, in a stark contrast to most other orga-
nized competitive sports. Adepts are welcomed among the ranks of the play-
ers, though magical powers are not considered an adequate substitute for
teamwork or skill. Cybernetic enhancements are strictly taboo as well, includ-
ing both cyberware and bioware.
Scoring
In the center of the field is an 8.3-meter pole with a symbol (often some
sort of animal representation) placed on the top of it. Hitting the symbol with
the ball scores seven points. Two points are scored if the ball hits the pole.
Fouls
There is very little that counts as a foul in a-ne-jo-di. If a foul is com-
mitted, the game is stopped and the ball is put into possession of the
opposing team.
Deliberately attacking another player is considered a foul, and
depending on the severity (and number of occurrences) can get a player eject-
ed from the game.
Using magical effects on the opposing team is considered a foul,
and penalties can vary from losing possession of the ball to being handicapped
magically to ejecting the offending conjuror from the game, depending on the
severity of the infraction.
THE LADIES OF THE BRAWL:
JESSIE RODRIGUEZ, SEATTLE SCREAMERS
by Jim Lucas, Sports Zine hostzine
Today our "Ladies of the Brawl" spot-
light is on the lead outrider for the Seattle
Screamers, Jessie Rodriguez. Jessie has
been with the Screamers for an astounding
three years, one of the longest stints by
any Screamers player in the history of the
franchise. She holds a league record for
disabling the most opponents in a season,
a rating that makes her among the most
popular players out there-with both the
fans and the management.
JL: Statistically speaking, you're among
the best outriders in the league, with an
astounding 82% hit ratio. How do you maintain such a high level of performance?
Continued on page 121
Imagine, if you will, a secluded room, dimly lit in rose and
amber. Soft music plays in the background. A window looks out
on a starry sky, with a huge moon glowing pale against the inky
blackness. Warm oiled hands expertly administer a full-body
massage as you hang suspended in midair, with every muscle
being pampered to the fullest.
Or maybe you're a techno-sybarite, an epicure of sensation
and experience. Imagine plugging into a living dream so real
that it completely overwhelms you, with nothing to ground you
in the reality you left behind until the ride is over and you're left
breathless, ready to fly again.
Sound too good to be true? It isn't. It's part and parcel of
the many delights available at Shibanokuji Freefall Resort, the first
orbital station devoted to recreation and tourism.
Shibanokuji has been in orbit around the earth since 2056,
when Yamatetsu unveiled it at a star-studded press conference.
It has operated without problems since then, becoming an off-
planet playground for celebrities and corporate titans, private
and public citizens alike.
This corporate-run enterprise is one of the most exclusive
resorts on (or near) Earth. Space at the resort is limited, allowing
for no more than fifty guests at a time. Those accommodations,
however, are among the most luxurious anywhere and certainly
the best that any orbital facility has to offer. The decor is definitely
post modern, but the Yamatetsu designers have used lighting
and fabric to soften the sometimes-harsh lines and transform the
rooms into bastions of comfort. Meals are prepared by a rotation
of world-class chefs, many of whom spend the rest of their time
working in five-star restaurants on Earth. Expert masseurs are
also available twenty-four hours a day.
Shibanokuji, however, does not stop at pampering
its guests with an incredible view and a spa-like atmos-
phere. It takes advantage of its orbital capabilities to offer
an experience unavailable elsewhere: zero gravity. While
the guestrooms and the dining rooms are at the outside
of the spinning station where the gravity is strongest, the
entertainment portion of the facility is in the hub.
In that area, the station offers a "weightless racquet-
ball" area, as well as special gymnastics and "flying"
training rooms. It also offers zero-G massage, zero-G pri-
vate suites for couples, and a zero-G simsense suite that
allows for a mind-blowingly realistic sim without any out-
side distractions to diminish the experience. In the
deluxe package, an assisted spacewalk is also among the
options available and considered a "must-do" by every-
one we spoke with at the station.
Shibanokuji is not for everyone. Prospective guests
are carefully screened to weed out any health problems
that might be complicated either by the trip or by pro-
longed time in a low-gravity area. Visits to Shibanokuji are
scheduled in seven-day intervals. There are no shuttles
available between times, but the resort does boast a top-
of-the-line medical facility in a separate area of the station
that handles zero-G medical procedures and research.
A seven-day visit to Shibanokuji starts at ¥750,000
and goes up from there, depending on the weight of the
person and the options chosen. Meals and transit are
included. Visitors are allowed to bring one bag with them
weighing no more than 5 kilos (clothing and other sun-
dries are provided by the station for the duration of the
visit). Reservations run about a year in advance (barring
cancellations), so it's best to plan ahead.
· | admit, I'm giving a lot more thought to Shibanokuji for
the next time I need to get out of town for a bit. Mrrowr.
· Trixster
· The staff also includes a few figures who double as
"escorts." Discreet inquiries and a little extra cash to the
concierge will let you make an appointment.
· Orbital Bandit
. Don't take advantage of the zero-G sim suite,
though, unless you really trust your technician. Frankly, I
wouldn't go in the place if you paid me, but I'm a para-
noid old geezer.
· FastJack
. I'm with FastJack on this one. Sensory deprivation sim
experiences make it way too easy to rewire the brain. A
twist of the knob, and you could be a whole new per-
son-literally.

a wiz trip ... I've never had anything else like it.

· Lemme guess, you were there as a guest of Yamatetsu,
right? I'll just bet you had fun-enough to keep you
coming back again and again. Feeling any noticeable
brand loyalty these days, Feral?
· Winger
. Just because you'd go back into space if you had the
chance doesn't mean you're warped. And Yamatetsu's
a good corp to work for, if you're half-competent.

. No corp is a "good corp to work for," kid. Open your
eyes already.

A NIGHT IN ATHENS
by Fiona Stavros
When I accepted this assignment, I was naturally a
bit nervous. The only images of Athens I could summon
up were the ones we all saw on the trid screens, of peo-
ple fighting in the streets with automatic weapons, of
wreckage and burned-out shells of formerly white houses. In
my mind's eye, clouds of billowing smoke obscured the once-
Jessie: < laugh> Practice, Jim. Really, though, when you love what you do, it's
not hard to keep doing it. I've always loved machines and guns, even when I was a lit-
tle girl. My parents were both mechanics and they taught me to know my machine inside
and out. My dad was also a Marine, so there you have the marksmanship side of things.
He tried to steer me towards competition shooting, but I had more fun rigging up one-
shot drones and using them for target practice. Still do, in fact.
JL: Jessie, you're reaching the three-year mark on your time with the Screamers.
That kind of longevity with the same franchise is unheard of in this sport, and it has
raised all kinds of speculation about your plans. Have you received any offers from
other teams?
Jessie: Yes, I have received a few offers, but I'm really not interested in leaving.
I have a good contract with the Screamers and I love Seattle. This is home to me. I've
made it known to the other parties that while I'm flattered by the attention, I'm not look-
ing to move at this point.
JL: Would you care to comment on who some of those teams might be? My
sources say that Predators have been very persistent in courting you.
Jessie: I'd be interested to see who those sources are, but other than that I have
no comment, no. It's really not polite to kiss and tell, even if it's just a peck on the cheek.
Besides, I'm not leaving Seattle, so it isn't important.
JL: Have you considered retirement at any time in the future?
Jessie: Not really. I'd prefer to keep playing the game for as long as possible.
Someday I'll settle into private life, but I've got a lot of time left. I don't think retire-
ment would suit me.
· So. continuing in our "spot the shadowrun" series, anyone want to
lay odds on Jessie Rodriguez resurfacing in an Ares team sometime
in the near future?
· Zephyr
. I've met Jessie. She's as good off the field as she is on it. I pity the
team that tries to pick her up against her will. She won't make it easy
on them. Hell. I only wish she'd work with me now and again.
. Joey
· But ... this makes no sense. Why would Ares make a very public offer.
only to turn around and nab her once it goes bad? That's stupid.
· Rose Red
. Well. it's my understanding that Ares isn't looking for her skills as a
part of the Predators, but instead as a "security consultant." If they
nab her. it won't be for the Brawl.
· Timberwolf
· And your source is ... ?
· Skeptic
proud Akropolis, and soldiers held watch over wrenchingly
impoverished streets.
Well, as they say-that was then, this is now.
When I stepped out of the airport, I was struck by how
much it differed from my expectations. Gone were the war-torn
streets of Athens, replaced by a city with both rustic avenues and
high-tech towers, often with the two sitting cheek by jowl. As I
planned for the night's festivities, I learned that Athens is the hub
for communications in this part of the world, the last bastion of
civilization before you hit the continued hostilities of Eastern
Europe. Nightlife abounds in Athens, given a natural cross
between the famous Greek hospitality and Athens's status as the
favored R&R stop for soldiers and mercenaries from rougher
areas. What this means to the traveler is that street crime is low
in most areas and sources of after-hours entertainment are plen-
tiful with a wide variety of options.
After a few hours of rest, I got up ready to find dinner and
fun. I ended up down near the Akropolis for dinner at around 10
PM, being part of the early meal crowd. I dined at the Strofi
restaurant and had some wonderful fun in picking out the food
and being fussed over by the waitstaff. The food was excellent,
making it easy for me to realize why the Strofi has been around
for nearly one hundred years. Dinner took roughly an hour and a
half to two hours, with each course (appetizer, main course, and
dessert) having plenty of room in between for music and con-
versation. Impatient North Americans may feel ignored with the
delay in the service, but it's all part of the Athens dining experi-
ence, where food and friends are lingered over, not rushed
through. Dining out is an event here, regardless of the simplici-
ty of the fare.
After I finally emerged from the restaurant, I took a cab over
to one of the hot bouzoukia-live Greek music venues-called
Neraida, Gorgones kai Manges (A Fairy, Mermaids and Dudes).
There were wall-to wall bodies there. The singer flirted and
danced his way through the crowd, stopping now and again to
rub hips with a scantily clad femme. The decor was a cross
between Greek myth and a construction site, but somehow the
club's owners managed to pull it off. The strobing lights made a
dazzling effect over the writhing bodies, bringing to mind a
scene of a post-modern Underworld. There isn't a spare seat in
the house when I arrive, but what's the point of being stuck in
Hades if you aren't going to dance and enjoy yourself?
After staying there for about two hours, I leave and wheel
on over to Tzatziki, a hip nightclub named for that ever-present
Greek appetizer. Rich young people wearing designer clothes
rub shoulders here with dark men in dark suits with cool
demeanors. This place is rumored to be a hit with both merce-
nary forces between assignments and the idle rich of the area,
both of which contribute to its icy-cool attitude. The music here
is canned, but the DJ keeps a fresh twist going all night long. It's
5:30 before the bouncers start shooing the reluctant patrons out
the door.
Outside, the ever-present hot-dog vendors sell breakfast to
the weary clubbers. The locals who feel a bit worse for wear usu-
ally skip past that to grab a bowl of patsas (tripe soup)-rumored
to be a sovereign cure for hangover-at one of the 24-hour
eateries around town. Myself, I skipped past the meat course to
go straight to the Koulouri Bakery, where breakfast is available in
the form of donuts, sesame-covered pretzels, and raisin buns.
As the dawn lights up the sky, the sea shimmers inviting-
ly. Traffic is already crowding the streets, and shopkeepers are
just setting out their goods for the day. Looking over this reas-
suring scene, I find myself glad that I accepted this assignment.
All the trepidation and stress were worth it in exchange for one
night in Athens.
· If you want anything done in Athens, go to Alexander's and tell
them you want the special. If it's available, he can get it for you.
· Stavros
. Don't believe a word of it. Alexander's as gay as an Easter
parade and he trades in joyboys and rough-stuff BTLs. More
people disappear asking for the "special" than you care to
think about.
· Mercury
· Right, and you don't just happen to work for Alexander's
biggest competitor? Don't believe the hype, just ask around.
· Stavros
CARNAVAL!
by Julia Weinburg
In Amazonia, the weather is beautiful in February. It's sum-
mer there at that time of year, and Rio's warm nights and gor-
geous beaches will send even the worst case of winter blahs
scurrying for cover. The people of the city, known as Cariocas,
are famous for their hedonistic lifestyle the year-round, with the
beaches, the beer, the beautiful bodies and the ballgames all
considered necessities of life down here. Then, of course,
Carnaval arrives and things really kick into high gear.
Rio de Janeiro once had a reputation of being beautiful but
cruel. Social problems here were high, with more than a third of
the population living in crushing poverty with no social structure
to help it better itself. In the years since Hualpa came to power,
however, things have changed. Now Rio is one of the safest
cities anywhere, with the favelas (shantytowns) a thing of the
past. The farmland that once surrounded the city has turned into
high-tech agrifarms, with hydroponic capabilities that allow the
nation to continue exports of soybeans, coffee, and sugar. The
city has also tripled in size, as the population of many
Amazonian interior cities were relocated to the coastal enclaves
of Sao Paulo and Rio.
What does this mean for Carnaval, you may wonder? The
answer is: everything. Rio's celebration was always among the
largest in the world. Now, it is the largest in the world. There's
more lodging available for tourists, a better transit system and
more restaurants than you could ever hope to visit. Every other
street has its own blocos or bandas small neighborhood
parades, many of them with their own themes. The city is literal-
ly one big party for Carnaval week, stretching late into the night
before taking a siesta the next morning and doing it all again.
The official parade of Carnaval is the Sambadrome parade held
at the Sambadrome stadium. Celebrities from the world over are
always in attendance. Hualpa even leads off the parade every
year, making a brief but memorable public appearance.
During the day, there's always shopping at one of the myr-
iad of outdoor markets. Gorgeous handmade shoes and purses
are everywhere as are jewelry and other local goods. If brows-
ing isn't your style, there are the beaches, rated among the best
in the world, or the casinos, where you can gamble the daylight
hours away.
While crime is down from years past, it always skyrockets
during Carnaval. Use common sense when traveling between
hotel and party and you're unlikely to have a problem. Do
remember, though, to wear your insect repellent or get your ward
set before going out. Dengue fever, malaria and Awakened
meningitis are all still very common in Rio, spread by those pesky
mosquitoes. And do bring back some beads for me, won't you?
· Hey Cap, it was great to see something on Rio for a change.
You can barely find anything on the place, even here.
· Sidewinder
. | was hoping someone would benefit from that. We're work-
ing on getting more information up for that part of the world, it's
just slow coming. Hualpa seems to discourage people from
telling tales, but it's only a matter of time. Stay tuned.
· Captain Chaos
"I am everywhere!"
· Carnaval is great for doing extractions, hits, almost anything
you care to name. During that two weeks, the local cops can't
find their own coffee cups, much less the suit that's in your trunk.
Everybody's too busy partying to worry about someone not
checking into their office for a couple of days.
· Ipanema
. Just don't get too cocky. If you make a splash, Hualpa's boys
will be down on you before you can breathe. And for your own
sake, don't look at the jungle as a way to get out of town and
lay low for a while. The jungles don't take well to townies who
think they're in an overgrown park.
· The Smiling Bandit
"Strikes Again! Ha! Ha! Ha!"
· That whole thing about Rio doing a 180 and being squeaky
clean? Don't you believe it. The shantytowns may have gotten
a coat of paint and a few paved streets, but they're still very
much a no man's land. Hide there if you have to, but be pre-
pared to pay for the privilege or be reported to the local jefe.
And he's got a boss, and he's got a boss, and it doesn't take
long for Rio to become a very unfriendly place if you don't play
your cards right.

GAME INFORMATION
Culture Shock is designed to allow the gamemaster to add
color to her games with real-time information on the Shadowrun
world of 2062, as well as providing additional story hooks. The
section provides a number of pop culture references for insertion
into any game, including information on culture, sports and trav-
el. In addition, new rules are given for technology, cracking pro-
grams, and getting in and out of tourist hot spots.
COFFIN CLUBS
Coffin clubs offer a place for magically-active revelers to
experience entertainment on an astral level without concern that
someone is causing trouble with their physical bodies. Security
varies by individual club but is always high. Coffins are locked
from the inside with maglocks. Protection around the club itself
is handled by hired magicians and spirit bouncers. For every five
security magicians, one will be of Initiate Grade 1 or higher.
Clubs are protected against outside intrusion by wards
with a minimum Force of 5, and special attention is given to
keeping out shedim spirits who would naturally consider such
a large number of unoccupied bodies to be ripe pickings. Even
so, most smart magicians also use watcher spirits and other
personal security methods to alert them to anyone tampering
with their bodies.
Customs vary, but most coffin clubs assense patrons upon
entering and levy cover charges according to their nature: mun-
danes pay roughly half of the charge for magicians, with the
usual charge in the range of 10-20¥. Though it isn't advertised
publicly, some clubs offer a "monthly pass" for a mere 1,000¥
that allows a patron to bypass the wards and attend shows with-
out trusting his or her physical body to one of the coffin cubicles.
Coffin club entertainment almost always consists of magi-
cally-active bands; it's difficult to convince mundane acts to play
clubs where most of the audience isn't even visible. When sign-
ing bands, club owners look for both talent and passion, but pas-
sion always comes first. Viewed from the astral plane, mediocre
bands who truly love what they're doing put on a better show
than technically proficient bands who are only in it for the cred.
Awakened bands that are both good and passionate can, under-
standably, name their price.
During particularly good shows, the background count of
coffin clubs can temporarily rise as high as 3. Staff magicians
sometimes employ cleansing metamagic to keep the astral
static down.
SIM-VIRONMENT
The Sim-Vironment is a merging of simsense technology
and limited Matrix capability. The environment provides a full
sim feed, only without the full RAS override that is the trademark
of most sim experiences. Most physical senses are filtered out,
as normal, but full physical movement is allowed. Users can
choose from among a host of different characters and experience
an interactive story in which they play out that character, inter-
acting physically with the other individuals in the Sim-Vironment
to bring the story to one of a number of pre-determined endings.
Aside from the lack of a RAS override, the other innovation
in the Sim-Vironment is the level of interactivity. Even in pre-
determined stories, the players can choose their actions and con-
trol the direction of the story (within preset limits). This level of
flexibility provides a completely immersive experience that rivals
experiences in the physical world. Most Sim-Vironment tracks
are thirty minutes long, but sixty-minute tracks are also available.
The cost for a session is 100¥ for a thirty-minute track, 150¥ for
a sixty-minute track.
With the full Dir-X sim-tracks combined with the ability to
determine your own actions, the Sim-Vironment can easily lead
an individual to lose touch with reality during the course of a
game. A character currently under the effects of the Sim-
Vironment must make a Willpower (8) Test to separate reality
from the Sim-Vironment and jack out. If the character does not
disconnect, the test must be repeated every 5 minutes to avoid
losing touch with reality. If the character fails, the TN increases by
1 for the next attempt.
Sim-Vironment tracks can be custom-written and inserted.
Those who specialize in high end BTL and sim production can
create a track, but the cost should be prohibitive-75,000¥ for a
four-person Dir-X, Full-X track and up. Sim-Vironments are delib-
erately kept off-line to avoid unauthorized access, so insertion of
a custom track must be physical.
SCULPTS AND CRACKING
Sculpts are constructs. To create a sculpt, use the rules for IC
constructs (p. 91, Matrix), except that an average sculpt has no
payload, no Hacking Pool and no initiative. Its core rating may
not exceed the programmer's Computer (Programming) skill.
Just as forgeries, unauthorized copies and stolen goods are
the dark underside of the glittering physical art world, the same
holds true in the Matrix. With the advent of Matrix sculpts as an
art form (and a lucrative one at that), the demand for knock-offs
is high enough to tempt almost any non-law-abiding citizen with
enough talent to pull it off.
Cracking
In order to copy or forge a utility, sculpt or any other pro-
gram, a character must have the source code (see p. 295, SR3).
If the source code is not available but the object code is, then a
process called "cracking" can be used to reverse engineer the
original source code from the object code.
In order to crack the source code of a program, the charac-
ter must have the object code. Cracking requires the Cracking
Knowledge skill; a program with a multiplier higher than this skill
cannot be cracked. The character also needs a computer with
both active and storage memory equal to or greater than the size
of the targeted program. To crack the object code, the character
makes a Computer (Programming) Test with a target number
equal to the rating of the target program +4. If used, the cracker
utility reduces this target number by its rating. If the computer
being used has twice the needed memory, apply a -2 modifier.
Cracking a program takes twice the base time it takes to cre-
ate the targeted program (Mp size in days x 2). Successes from
the Computer (Programming) Test can reduce this time.
Cracking Knowledge Skill
This skill encompasses techniques and tricks for reverse
engineering object code. Characters cannot crack programs with
a multiplier higher than their Cracking skill.
Cracker Utility
Multiplier: 6
Options: Adaptive, bug-ridden, crashguard, DINAB, limit,
optimization, sneak.
The cracker utility is very difficult to program. The maximum
rating that can be programmed is equal to half the Computer
(Programming) skill of the programmer, round up.
The cracker utility is designed to derive the source code
of a program from the finished object code (p. 295, SR3). The
utility reduces the target numbers to derive a program's
source code.
Signature Program Option
Design Rating Modifier: +3
The signature option allows the decker to embed a signa-
ture style into the code of the program, making the source code
harder to reverse engineer. The signature option applies a +4 tar-
get number penalty to attempts to derive the source code from
the object code.
Signatures are unique to the programmer who uses them
by their nature. This means that individuals trying to determine
the author of a program receive +1 die on legwork checks
regarding the signature style used.
GETTING IN AND OUT
This section provides details on accessing and leaving the
locales described in Travel Hot Spots, p. 119.
Shibanokuji Freefall Resort
Weekly suborbital flights to Shibanokuji are available by
reservation, with a six-hour layover at the Yamatetsu Center on
the Ares-owned Apollo Station. In-depth cyberscans are con-
ducted during that layover. Any weapons or communications
cyberware are deactivated for the remainder of the trip; failure to
comply results in a quick trip back down the gravity well.
A passport is required for travel to Shibanokuji, as well as a
medical release form signed by one of Yamatetsu's medical staff.
Thorough background checks are performed as a matter of
course, and while discrepancies won't bar you from being
allowed onto the station, they will ensure that the staff keeps a
close eye on you for the duration of the visit.
While shuttles from Apollo Station only fly every Tuesday,
Shibanokuji does have two emergency pods, and can summon
another shuttle from Apollo on 12 hours notice. Emergency
shuttles also fly to the medical side of the facility as needed, car-
rying patients to and from the treatment center at need.
Athens, Greece
International travel to and from Athens is handled pri-
marily by air through Hellenikon International Airport. The air-
port itself is only about 11 kilometers from the city, but the
traffic on the only thoroughfare between the two can take
more than an hour to traverse.
For domestic travel in and out of Athens, the Piraeus seaport
is the main choice. It has subway, taxi and bus access into town,
but the taxis will often charge exorbitant prices and buses don't
run at night. Another option is the port of Rafina, which is rough-
ly an hour's bus ride east of Athens.
Trains are also an option, and the Hellenic Federal Republic
has sunk quite a bit of money into rebuilding the rail infrastruc-
ture. The train service is one of the fastest, cheapest and most
reliable ways to get from one mainland city-state to another.
Taking a car is not recommended, as traffic throughout much of
the mainland (especially in and around Athens) is truly terrible.
For international travelers, a passport is required for entry.
No visa is required for visitors staying less than 30 days; a 90-
day tourist visa must be obtained for longer stays.
The Athens RTG is one of the best available in this part
of the world, thanks in no small part to the heavy corporate
and military influence. It is sculpted to resemble the
Akropolis, with all hosts required to conform to a classical
Greek external appearance.
Rio de Janeiro, Amazonia
International travel to and from Rio de Janeiro is only really
possible by air or sea. Two airports service Rio: the Aeroporto
Galeo, which is 15 km north of the city, and Aeroporto Santos
Dumont. Galeo is the international airport, while Santos Dumont
is used primarily for domestic flights. Rio is also a popular stop on
international cruises, with at least two major cruise lines running
to the city year-round. Buses run from the airports and around the
city, but they're often crowded, slow and the primary site for rob-
beries in the sprawl. An excellent and well-maintained subway is
also available covering the central part of the city.
As to venturing deeper into Amazonia, there are a number
of officially sanctioned tours of the area's natural wonders. These
tours are carefully supervised, however, and have no tolerance
for stragglers. For a less official way into the interior, the only
options are boat, wagon, or foot. The hard-won highway system
that once spanned the nation is no more than a memory now,
and there are no roadways leading to the interior that will sup-
port wheeled transportation for very long.
Boats are the most popular and most reliable form of trans-
portation available outside of the cities. The price of a ride will
vary wildly depending on where you want to go. Players will be
well served to remember that the Awakened creatures of the
Amazon Basin are their own best guardians now, and they don't
appreciate humans encroaching on their newly regained homes.
A passport is required for entry, valid for at least 90 days
past date of entry. Once inside, visitors must obtain a tourist
visa that is good for 90 days. One extension is possible, no
more. Health risks in the area include Chagas's disease,
dengue fever, malaria, meningitis, Awakened meningitis (a
more virulent, mana-feeding version of traditional meningi-
tis), rabies, and yellow fever. Most if not all of these diseases
are carried by mosquitoes here, making regular insects a very
real threat.
The Rio grid is solid, if small. Only the San Paolo LTG is
comparable as far as public grids within Amazonia go. The
sculpting represents a section of Ipanema Beach after dark,
with a virtual sea stretching endlessly out to one side and blaz-
ing city lights on the other.
