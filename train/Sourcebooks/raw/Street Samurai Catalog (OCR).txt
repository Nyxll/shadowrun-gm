Our regular subscribers will notice quite a difference between this catalog and our last. As a direct result of input from our customers, we’ve been able to streamline enormously. We’ve taken their suggestions and transformed this catalog into a primary source for quality weapons and equipment. Every item on these pages has passed the most rigorous tests. That’s why when you buy from Ares America, you know you’re buying the best.  

We’ve also begun offering the best money-back guarantee in the business. All our equipment has a flat 90-day warranty, no questions asked. On top of that, you still get our phenomenal 60-day or 1,000-round warranty on light firearms and 30-day or 10,000-round warranty on heavy firearms. The best in the business, because you demanded it.

As anyone can see, this is the current Ares catalog. Normally available only to subscribers, this posted copy isn’t protected, so feel free to comment as you like. All you jokers who read this, beware! I’ve got no control over who says what in this file once it’s up, so not everything you read may be chip-truth. But then again, you never know ....]<<<<<

The size of a cigarette pack, this small device contains four quartz halogen micro-flashes designed to fire in random sequence to create a series of searing flashes that disorient, distract, and possibly even blind anyone looking in their direction! Works even against cybereyes with flare compensation!  

| **Concealability** | **Rating** | **Weight** | **Cost** |

| 12                 | +4         | 0.2        | 250¥     |  

Use of a Flash-Pak gives opponents facing the Flash-Pak a +4 target modifier to all ranged attacks. Opponents with flare compensation receive only a +2 target modifier. The modifier is reduced by 1 for every 5 meters from the Flash-Pak. The Pak also negates effects of poor or no lighting for the duration of its use but imposes its own +2 modifier because of its stroboscopic nature.

**MICRO FLARE**  
- A penlight-sized flare launcher!  
- Perfect for those sudden emergencies!  

Winter Systems of Manhattan has finally released one of its patented mini-system security devices to the general public, the Micro Flare. A little larger than a penlight, the Micro Flare packs a full-size warning/hazard flare. Capable of reaching altitudes in excess of 200 meters, the flare is available in white, red, or green. Reloadable, it makes the perfect emergency signaling device.  

| **Item** | **Concealability** | **Rating** | **Weight** | **Cost** |

*If fired as a weapon, use the Bow Range Table, plus an additional +2 target modifier at all ranges beyond Short. The weapon will inflict 4M damage and ignite flammables. The Rating indicates that the flare will negate a +2 target modifier due to low or poor light. The flare will illuminate an area equal to one square city block.*

**MP LASER**  
- Finally, an efficient portable laser system!  

Ares Arms is proud to announce the first portable laser system with the ability to deliver enough joules of energy to make a difference. Built from seven different Ares patents, the MP Laser is the future of security and law-enforcement weaponry. Designed to be fielded by a single carrier, unlike inefficient two-man team weapons, the MP Laser is a self-contained system capable of handling high-threat situations. Powerful enough to affect even armored vehicles, the MP Laser is a multi-purpose weapon perfectly suited for the variety of volatile and unpredictable situations that the modern professional confronts. The MP Laser is powered by six high-performance, peak-discharge soft batteries mounted along each thigh. These batteries, as a unit, are good for 20 pulses of energy. The entire power system is designed for easy replacement, and each battery package can be recharged for later use. Meet the future head-on; arm up with Ares and the MP Laser system.  

| **Conceal** | **Mode** | **Shots** | **Damage** | **Weight** | **Cost** |  
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------|------------|----------|  
| NA          | SA       | 20*       | 15M        | 30         | 2,500,000¥ |  

*Per battery package. Use the Sniper Rifle Range Table for determining Range Steps. Decrease the Power Level of the weapon by 2 for each Step beyond Short (Medium -2, Long -4, Extreme -6). Ballistic Armor has no effect against the MP Laser, and Impact Armor is only one-half (round down) effective. There is no recoil penalty.*  

>>>>>[Can you believe this? This isn’t a security or law-enforcement weapon; it’s a military weapon. What the hell is it doing in a “security” catalog? Can we expect next year’s catalog to include Seve-7 nerve gas, high-explosive, multiple high-velocity fragmenting claymore-style mines, and low-yield sub-tactical nukes? Let’s get some chip-truth here, chummers. Has Ares lost it, or are they callously displaying the same blatant disregard for the “have-nots” as virtually every other security agency in existence? I have always considered Knight Errant to be one of the more respectable security/enforcement agencies, but after reading this document, I see I must have been horribly mistaken.]<<<<<

**ARES MP LMG**  
- The most popular light machine gun in the world.  

The Ares MP is the weapon of choice of more military and paramilitary organizations around the world than any other light machine gun. Capable of sustained automatic fire for hours on end, the Ares MP comes equipped with an integral laser sight, a Gas-Vent 2 recoil-compensation system, and a hip-pad bracing system.

**VINDICATOR MINIGUN**  
- Electric-driven, multiple rotating-barrel firepower!  

Based on the popular GE M134 hardpoint minigun design, the Vindicator is a portable weapon of astounding firepower. High-density batteries provide the power needed to spin the six rotating barrels, allowing the weapon to fire at an incredible rate. The rotating-barrel design prevents barrel-warping due to excess heat, and the isolated ammo feed reduces the dangers of cook-offs, misfires, and misfeeds. Not for the weak-kneed.

*This weapon has a permanent rate of fire of 15 rounds per Complex Action. This rate cannot be adjusted. Use the heavy weapon recoil rules (SRII, p. 85).*  

>>>>>[Be warned. I recently had the opportunity to see this weapon in use during a run. Once the rotating barrels are activated, you’ve only got about ten minutes of fire time before the batteries geek. It also takes a few seconds (1 turn) for the barrels to get up to speed. Once they’re there, however, it’s major hosing time. Rock and Roll!]<<<<<

**STONER-ARES M107 GPHMG**  
- Chosen by the UCAS Armed Forces!  

From Stoner-Ares Weapon Systems of Detroit, Michigan, comes the latest in the long line of Stoner-Ares weapon systems, the M107 GPHMG (General Purpose Heavy Machine Gun). Based on the previous Stoner-Ares heavy design, the battle-proven M98tz, the M107 features many of the same advantages of its older brother, merged with the technological improvements of the last decade. Capable of taking ammunition from either a 40-round internal clip or an external disintegrating belt, the M107 comes with a Gas-Vent 3 recoil-reduction system and an integral laser sight.

**APDS AMMUNITION**  
- Military-grade ammunition for the street professional!  

A definite must for the serious security or law-enforcement professional. Illegal in most places, APDS ammunition is considered essential to maintaining an edge on the streets. Available in all ammo sizes, the APDS rounds combine the armor-defeating capability of a high-tech neo-carbide round with the velocity-enhancing characteristics of the battle-proven discarding sabot system.

**GYRO-MOUNT SYSTEM**  
- Rugged, durable, precision gyroscopic stabilization!  

This overbody, vest-style, gyro-stabilization system is perfect for those unwieldy weapons like the Ingram Valiant or the Ares MP Light Machine Gun. Consisting of an anchored shock harness and quick-detach battery cases, the Gyro-Mount System carries the weapon on an articulated arm attached to the shock harness at the waist. The weapon is mounted on the top of the gimbal arm and is capable of full motion on three axes and through 160 degrees. The quad-cell battery system provides roughly three hours of continuous use at full load.

**NET-GUN**  
- Take them down, but don’t take them out!  

From Williams Technologies of New York, formerly Chandler, comes a non-lethal tool, the net gun. Firing an expanding fiber net that envelopes and restrains the target, this weapon is perfect for situations demanding less-than-lethal response. The normal version will restrain average and below-average size targets, while the extra-large variant has been designed for those larger-than-normal Orks and Trolls. Note that the extra-large net gun will fire normal nets. Comes with a built-in laser sight.  

| **Type** | **Concealability** | **Ammo** | **Damage** | **Weight** | **Cost** |  
|----------|--------------------|----------|------------|------------|----------|  
| Normal Net Gun | 4          | 4(b)     | Special    | 4          | 750¥     |

| Additional Net Shots (Large) | 5  | —        | —          | 0.75       | 300¥     |  

*The Net Gun entangles its victim, restraining him and forcing him to the ground. The victim must make a Strength Resistance Test against twice the number of extra successes generated by the attacker’s success roll, with a Target Number of 5 for the Normal Net or 8 for the Large Net. If a Normal Net is shot at a large target, the victim’s Target Number is 3. The target can use his Combat Pool. Once entangled, the victim is immobile and unable to act in any manner. He may attempt to escape from the net once per turn by making a Strength Resistance Test against the Target Number listed above, but with a -1 modifier for every turn he has been entangled.*  

**ARMORED RIOT-CONTROL VEHICLE**  
- Beyond a doubt, the ultimate urban security vehicle!  

Based on the popular Ares Citymaster chassis, the Armored Riot-Control Vehicle can fulfill all urban security needs. Not only is the basic vehicle an upgrade of the Citymaster design, but add-on packages are available to adapt the vehicle to the needs of your particular urban situation. The Armored Riot-Control vehicle comes with a dual-mount roof-turret hardpoint and a pair of side gas-grenade launchers. The vehicle is set up to act as a command post and staging base for up to ten riot-equipped troops, but other configurations are available on request.

**WASP AND YELLOWJACKET**  
- The ultimate one-man, high-threat vehicle!  

The Northrup PRC-42b Wasp and PRC-44b Yellowjacket are premier single-man rotorcraft ideal for security and law-enforcement work. Designed as a military platform, the lighter, more nimble Wasp is well-suited to security support operations, while its slightly larger cousin, the Yellowjacket, is designed for high-threat, high-priority tactical support missions. Both the Wasp and Yellowjacket offer the pilot the option of cutting power to the rotors some distance away and gliding to the target on autorotation effect. Both platforms can deploy light glider-effect wings to assist in this. In this mode, the Wasp and Yellowjacket are virtually undetectable.

**HEADWARE (Section HH1962)**  
*(Amend existing reference files to include the following listings. Current as of distribution date.)*  

**COMMUNICATIONS LINK**  
The perfect accessory for any internal radio transceiver or remote telephone system. The four different models allow the user to simultaneously monitor and access 2, 4, 8, or 10 channels of communication. With the proper links, these could be all radio, all telephone (voice only), or any combination. The comlink system allows you to:  
- Monitor and access up to ten radio or telephone channels.  
- Provide routing and switching to allow callers on separate channels.  
- Selectively lock out certain channels to screen audio clutter.  
- Output onto a display system the status of all channels.  
- Receive subtle visual notification of incoming calls.  

| **Item** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|----------|------------------|----------|  
| Commlink-II | 0.3          | 8,000¥   |  
| Commlink-IV | 0.3          | 18,000¥  |  
| Commlink-VIII | 0.3        | 40,000¥  |  
| Commlink-X | 0.3           | 60,000¥  |  

*The listed costs are for either a radio-only or telephone-only system. For a comlink system that handles both simultaneously (maximum ten channels), increase the base cost by 25 percent. Multiple systems cannot be linked together. When inserted as part of a package with either a Radio Transceiver, Receiver, or Headware Telephone, the essence cost is halved.*  

>>>>>[Definitely not for the easily confused.]<<<<<  
— FastJack <04:18:35/12-19-50>  

**CRYPTO CIRCUIT HD**  
A headware communications accessory, the Crypto Circuit HD allows transmission and reception of scramble-coded signals of varying levels of sophistication. Each signal transmitted by a Crypto Circuit system is layered with a sequenced code accessible only by other Crypto Circuit systems with the proper decoding sequence. The special code provides a potentially infinite variety of sequences. This patented system is in use by military, governmental, and corporate security forces worldwide.  

| **Level** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|-----------|------------------|----------|  
| 1-4       | 0.1              | (Level) x 10,000¥ |  
| 5-7       | 0.1              | (Level) x 20,000¥ |  
| 8-9       | 0.1              | (Level) x 30,000¥ |  
| 10        | 0.1              | 50,000¥  |  

*The Crypto Circuit HD is fully compatible with the comlink system and can provide coding and decoding functions for all channels. Both sender and receiver must be equipped with Crypto Circuit systems. The rating of the receiver’s system must equal or exceed that of the sender. The Crypto Circuit causes no Essence Loss when inserted as a package with either a Radio, Radio Receiver, or Headware Telephone system. The Crypto Circuit system is also available for non-cyberware communication equipment at 50 percent of the listed price.*  

**HEARING AMPLIFICATION**  
This headware enhancement system boosts the sensitivity of either natural or cybernetic hearing. This is a full-spectrum increase, not the mid-range (average voice frequencies) increase common with some systems. The effect of the amplification system is similar to that of a shotgun microphone, with the user able to hear as though he were ten times closer to the sound source. The Damper enhancement is highly recommended with all Hearing Amplification systems.  

| **Item** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|----------|------------------|----------|  
| Hearing Amplification | 0.2     | 3,500¥   |  

**RANGEFINDER**  
This cyber-sight accessory is identical to the weapon-mounted Rangefinder systems currently in use. When coupled with a display, the Rangefinder indicates the current range to target, whether it be to where the wearer is looking or where his weapon is pointed if he is using a smartgun.  

| **Item** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|----------|------------------|----------|  
| Rangefinder | 0.1          | 2,000¥   |  

**SCRAMBLE BREAKER HD**  
The ultimate in code-breaking technology, this headware accessory uses technology similar to that of the Crypto Circuit. The Scramble Breaker HD allows the wearer to attempt to penetrate the code of any encrypted signal and unscramble it.  

| **Level** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|-----------|------------------|----------|  
| 1-4       | 0.2              | (Level) x 20,000¥ |  
| 5-7       | 0.2              | (Level) x 40,000¥ |  
| 8         | 0.2              | 600,000¥ |  

*The Scramble Breaker HD is compatible with the comlink system and can provide full code-breaking functions to all channels. It causes only 0.1 Essence Loss when inserted as a package with either a Radio, Radio Receiver, or Headware Telephone. The Scramble Breaker system is also available for non-cyberware communication equipment at half the listed price. The procedure for breaking a coded signal is identical to that used by a Data Codebreaker and Dataline Encryption System.*  

**SELECT SOUND FILTER**  
This audio accessory allows the user to selectively filter out certain sounds without affecting other sounds present. Uses would include filtering out environmental sounds in order to monitor a conversation more easily. The Select Sound Filter system comes in a variety of grades of technical sophistication and is compatible with all cyber-hearing systems and accessories.  

| **Item** | **Essence Loss** | **Level** | **Cost** |  
|----------|------------------|-----------|----------|  
| Sound Filter | 0.2          | 1-5       | Level x 10,000¥ |  

*To use the Select Sound Filter, the user must make an Unresisted Success Test. He rolls dice equal to the filter’s Rating against a Target Number based on the amount of noise the user wishes to filter compared to the total amount of noise present. If the noise to be filtered is only 10 percent of the sound present, the Target Number would be 2 or 3. If, on the other hand, it was 90 percent of the total sound present, it could be as high as 10 or 11. Fifty percent would be about 6. The exact numbers depend on the circumstances and the sounds involved. Louder sounds are far more difficult to filter than softer ones.*

— The Neon Samurai <13:14:24/12-12-50>  

**SENSE LINK**  
The Sense Link system is a basic Simulated Senses (Simsense) recording rig made affordable. Consisting of a series of phased neural sensors, the Sense Link can record and transmit the basic sensory impressions the wearer is receiving. The Sense Link can record full-spectrum sight, sound, smell, taste, and touch but does not record the wearer’s emotions or attitudes. The Sense Link impression can be transmitted or recorded at a rate of 10Mp per 10 seconds of impressions. A Simsense player or cyberdeck is necessary to play back the recorded sensory impressions. Only a cyberdeck has the necessary electronics to play back a Sense Link transmission in real time.

— Findler-Man <21:13:32/12-18-50>  

**VIDEO LINK**  
Until recently, a still video image was all that could be recorded from a cyber-sight system. A Video Link can transmit a live video image or can record it in headware memory or in a separate portable recorder. The image is preserved in three-dimensional color. If some form of cyber-hearing system is present, an audio track can be recorded as well. With 6Mp of memory, either internal or external, the user can record 1 minute of low-resolution video.  

| **Item** | **Essence Loss** | **Concealability** | **Cost** |

**SKILL HARDWIRE**  
New Biofiber technology allows the permanent grafting of skill responses to an existing organic neuromuscular system. A Skill Hardwire can replicate any active, non-knowledge/information-based skill. Once installed, the Skill Hardwire is permanent and should never need maintenance within the user’s lifetime.  

| **Level** | **Essence Loss** | **Cost** |  
|-----------|------------------|----------|  
| 1-4       | 2 x Rating       | Rating x 5,000¥ |  
| 5-8       | 0.25 x Rating    | Rating x 50,000¥ |  
| 9-10      | 0.3 x Rating     | Rating x 500,000¥ |  

*Can only be used for Active, Concentrated Skills, not Science, Mental, Social, or Magical Skills. Each Skill Hardwire is good for only 1 Skill and can never be changed, altered, upgraded, or modified. The Skill chosen must be a Concentration. General Skills and Specializations are not permitted.*  

**WORKING THE STREETS**  
*Abridged from an article by the same name, written by William “Wedge” Horkwood, first published in the June 2050 issue of Street Fighting Man*  

BLAM! A single gunshot and another all-too-wise razorboy gets geeked. Why? Because he was stupid. Because he thought he knew best. Because he refused to listen.  

Every punker that hits the streets thinks he knows best. He thinks he’s got the ultimate edge and that everybody else will just fold up when he pops those long chromium carbide blades. Wrong. They’re going to laugh instead.  

The moment you step out on the streets, you must immediately assume that you are in a war zone and that you are a target. On the street, paranoia is a way of life. Without it, you’re pizza. Assume that every situation, every deal, is potentially life-threatening, and you just might live to see the morning.  

There is no clean and fast way to work the streets. Nobody has a patented method of survival, but keeping certain things in mind just might make life a little safer.  

- Assume that everything you do is part of your own personal little war. All this drek about “Zenning” through life is garbage. Might as well put a bag over your head and dance in traffic.  
- Think about what you are doing. Plan ahead. Study your options. Try to out-think your opponent. Consider what he’s going to do next, and what you can do to be ready for it.  
- Know your enemy. By learning all you can about him, you can begin to understand how he thinks and is likely to react. Knowledge is power.  
- Always check with your Contacts. Even if the deal looks so clean it squeaks, check it out. Even if it’s your big-buddy older brother sliding it to you, check it out. I’m not saying you should always believe everything you hear, but put your ear to the pavement and listen anyway.  
- Pay attention to your surroundings. Know your territory. Too many young razorboys assume they can get away with carrying their Kingslayer Assault Cannons casually over one shoulder while window-shopping along Money Street.  
- Laws and enforcement vary, depending on where you are. Procedures can change from block to block and from cop to cop. If you’re in a neighborhood that the cops like, play it safe, take it easy, and keep it concealed. The worse the neighborhood, the more the cops are going to let things slide. A heavy weapon of any kind is an excuse to call out the riot squad, and an assault rifle is worth at least three carloads of backup, and maybe even a light chopper.  
- Carrying big guns and obvious armor is just asking for trouble, in any neighborhood. In many places, an obvious weapon or obvious armor makes you an immediate target.  
- Understand how this war of yours is going to be fought. It serves no purpose to have your H&K 227 in perfect working order if your enemy is going to shut you down with long-range magic. Study the options, consider the possibilities.  
- It also serves no purpose to take on an obviously superior foe head-on. Use hit-and-run tactics whenever possible. Keep your engagements short and sharp. Use the shock of violence to your advantage and be gone before that shock wears off. Leave the protracted open-field fighting to the military idiots who have the manpower to soak up the casualties.  
- If you do get into combat, try to get out of it as fast as you can. There is too much uncertainty in the chaos of battle to guarantee any result. If you must fight, control it. Choose the terrain, choose the weaponry, choose the participants.  
- Do not let your opponent set the pace. Be active, not reactive. Force his hand, rather than letting him force yours. Gain and hold the initiative.  
- Harass your opponent. Anger may lead to error.  
- The only thing you can be certain of is what you can do. Everything else is suspect.  
- And never, ever, be dumb enough to think you’ve won.  

**DAMAGE TABLE DEFINITIONS**  
**Other Cybersystem**  
This includes any and all systems not covered by one of the above categories, including cyberware mounted in odd places, and Speech and Voice modification systems.  

Any damaged system must be repaired (see page 96). If the same system is damaged more than once before it is repaired, then it must be replaced.  

If the damaged system is Second-Hand Cyberware, any damage to the system results in a complete loss of the cyberware, which must be fully replaced (see Upgrading Cyberware).  

Karma can be spent to purchase a re-roll if a damage result is undesirable. The cost is 1 Karma Point per re-roll. This can be repeated as often as the player wishes until he gets the desired result or runs out of Karma.  

**DETERMINING SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE**  
The method for determining exactly which subsystems will be affected is different for each character. After determining which specific system has been affected, make a list of the character’s various pieces of cyberware

Since you requested to continue fixing the spelling and grammar in another artifact, but no new document was provided, I will proceed with completing the correction of the remaining sections from the previously provided "Street Samurai Catalog (OCR).txt" document. The previous response corrected the document up to the "DETERMINING SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE" section. Below, I will continue from that point, addressing spelling, grammar, and formatting issues while preserving the original tone, structure, and context (including intentional slang or stylistic elements in user comments). Obvious OCR errors, typos, and grammatical inconsistencies will be fixed, and punctuation will be standardized for clarity.

---

**DETERMINING SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE**  
The method for determining exactly which subsystems will be affected varies for each character. After identifying which specific system has been damaged, compile a list of the character’s various pieces of cyberware that fall under that category, using the following guidelines:  

- If there is only one subsystem in the category, that system is damaged.  
- If the category includes two systems, there is a 50 percent chance that either one will be affected. Roll 1D6: a 1–3 result damages System A; a 4–6 result damages System B.  
- If there are three systems in the category, the chances are as follows: 1–2 damages System A; 3–4 damages System B; 5–6 damages System C.  
- If there are four to six systems, the chances are:  
  - 1 = System A  
  - 2 = System B  
  - 3 = System C  
  - 4 = System D  
  - 5 = System E (if none, roll again)  
  - 6 = System F (if none, roll again)  
- If there are more than six systems, the following may be used as a guideline:  

**Chart 1**  
- 1 = System A  
- 2 = System B  
- 3 = System C  
- 4 = System D  
- 5 = System E  
- 6 = Roll on Chart 2  

**Chart 2**  
- 1 = System G  
- 2 = System H (if none, roll again on Chart 1)  
- 3 = System I (if none, roll again on Chart 1)  
- 4 = System J (if none, roll again on Chart 1)  
- 5 = System K (if none, roll again on Chart 1)  
- 6 = System L (if none, roll again on Chart 1)  

**UPGRADING OR REPLACING CYBERWARE**  
*What’s the matter, the old stuff ain’t good enough no more?*  
— Lou Welby, Street Doc  

At some point, you may want to upgrade the piece of cyberware you are currently using or may need to replace it. In either case, the procedure is the same.  

All cyberware upgrades or replacement procedures are considered Elective Surgery, as described on page 144 of the Shadowrun rules. No medical rolls are necessary for the surgery itself, as we assume technology has advanced to a state where table deaths are very rare.  

The attending physician (or whoever is performing the surgery) does make a roll to determine how well the surgery was performed. Good surgery can reduce Essence Cost, while sloppy surgery can increase it. The character performing the surgery must make a Biotech (B/R) Skill Roll against a Target Number equal to 10 minus the new Essence of the character undergoing surgery. This new Essence is the rating the character receives if the current surgery occurs without difficulties. After the Surgery Roll, consult the Essence Cost Table below.  

**ESSENCE COST TABLE**  
| **Result** | **Effect** |  
|------------|------------|  
| No Successes | +15% Essence |  
| 1 Success | +10% Essence |  
| 2–3 Successes | No change |  
| 4–5 Successes | -10% Essence |  
| 6 or greater | -20% Essence |  

Apply the percentage listed to the Essence Cost to determine the actual Essence Cost. If the Essence Cost would leave the character with an Essence of less than 0, surgery will be suspended prior to death, the cyberware will remain uninstalled, and the character’s Essence will be set to 0.  

As an option, the gamemaster may choose not to inform the player of their character’s current new Essence. In this case, the player would only know what their Essence is as a result of successful surgery. It is then their choice to take any further risks with additional surgery down the line.  

**CUSTOM CYBERWARE**  
*It may be good, but there’s always better.*  
— Dr. Aidan Jarmani  

Nothing gleams brighter than custom chrome. Go deep enough into the cities of Chiba, San Francisco, Brussels, Tel Aviv, Manhattan, Oslo, or Seattle, and you’ll find them: Shadow Clinics.  

A Shadow Clinic is the place to obtain the best, smoothest, slickest, and most expensive cyberware available. Most of it is not even made from recognizable technology, but it works. The name Shadow Clinic comes from the fact that they’re unlicensed and underground, existing deep in the shadows. The established medical profession definitely disapproves of the “experimental medicine” they practice.  

So, what exactly can custom cyberware do for a character? First, it is of better quality, usually some bio-technological metaconstruct, meaning it costs less Essence. It is also more resistant to damage but far more difficult to repair.  

The Shadow Clinics to which characters are most likely to have access offer basic levels of Custom Cyberware: Alpha and Beta, with Alpha being the cheaper, less-efficient grade.  

| **Grade** | **Essence Reduction** | **Cost Multiple** | **Damage Resist** |  
|-----------|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------|  
| Alpha     | -20% (x0.8)           | x3                | 5/6               |  
| Beta      | -40% (x0.6)           | x7                | 4/5               |  

**ESSENCE REDUCTION**  
Reduce the amount of Base Essence Cost by the percentage listed (or use the multiplier given in parentheses). Round all numbers up. Essence Cost may never be reduced below 0.05 in this manner.  

**COST MULTIPLE**  
Multiply the cost for the cyberware by the number indicated. Remember that this is only the cost for the actual piece of hardware and does not include doctor’s fees or hospitalization.  

**DAMAGE RESISTANCE**  
The first number given is the target for resisting damage from Serious Wounds, and the second is for Deadly Wounds. When a piece of custom cyberware is damaged, roll 5 dice against the Target Number indicated above. Only one success is necessary for the damage to be ignored completely.  

**CHEAP CYBERWARE**  
*BARGAIN BASEMENT CYBERWARE! I swear, a little old lady from Pasadena. Would I lie to you?*  
— Dynamic Dave, Cyber Salesman  

Yes, it is possible to get second-hand cyberware. It costs 50 percent less but is prone to breakage. Installation and Essence Cost are the same as for a normal piece of cyberware.  

Second-hand cyberware does not necessarily break every time a character uses it—only when it is crucial that it not break. Once per adventure (and only once), the gamemaster may require the player to make a Resistance Test for the piece of cyberware. Roll 5 dice against a Target Number of 4, modified by circumstances as the gamemaster sees fit. (For example, if it is a cheap cyberarm and the character is dangling from it off a building, the Target Number could go as high as 8.) Normal Karma rules apply, but it costs 2 points of Karma per die re-rolled.  

If the piece of second-hand cyberware fails, it must be replaced. No repair is possible.  

The potential failure of a piece of cyberware should only be used to increase dramatic tension and not to harass the players. It is quite possible that it would never be appropriate at any time during the adventure for a particular character to make a roll against that piece of cyberware. So be it.  

This option should only be used to add fun to the game and not as an excuse for sudden character mortality.  

**SAMURAI ARCHETYPES**  

**ELF STREET SAMURAI**  
“There are some who claim that elves do not make good warriors. I am one who proves them wrong. Cross me and learn the true definition of elven wrath.  

The streets are as much my home as they are yours. Do not make the foolish mistake of assuming my abilities are limited to things growing green and lush in the forest. I prefer darker tones.  

My price is that which I have stated, and I stand by my reputation. If that is not enough, then perhaps you should seek the services of another. If the price is agreeable, then I suggest we discuss details. Time grows short.”  

**Commentary:** Do not make the mistake of stereotyping the elf street samurai. He may be cunning and subtle, but his physical ability makes him an even match for anyone on the streets.

**ORK STREET SAMURAI**  
“You seem surprised. Is it my clothing? The way I speak? Or is it the fact that I am samurai?  

If you intend to work the street, you cannot be surprised. Surprise means weakness, and weakness spells death. You must learn to expect everything.  

And I expect you will find the conditions for my employment agreeable. Believe me, there is no one better suited than me. I am perfect for your shadowrun.  

Dere ain’t nobody better who knows da streets like I do. There, does that sound more orkish for you?”  

**Commentary:** Need to cut a deal with orks? The ork street samurai is your man. Need to cut a deal with anyone? The ork street samurai is still your man.  

Don’t let the charming good looks or phony accent fool you. Beneath the smiling face is a street veteran, a tough professional who’s lived through more trouble than you want to know. That’s why he’s smiling.  

Because of his lack of cyberware, the ork street samurai has a lighter touch than you would expect. He prefers more “organic” solutions.

**TROLL STREET SAMURAI**  
“I understand you got a problem here? That’s why you called me, right? So, what is it?  

Point him out to me, and your troubles are over. If ‘mean’ were a name on the streets, it would be me.  

I can handle any job. You just tell me what you’re willing to pay, and I’ll let you know if I’m insulted.”
