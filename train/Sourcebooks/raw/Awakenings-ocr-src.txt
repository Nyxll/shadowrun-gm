**NEW MAGIC IN 2057**  
*"Used to be, magic was pretty simple. Well, OK, not simple exactly ... but you knew where people stood with it. A magician was either the guy in the robes with the formulas or the guy summoning spirits in the wild with the bearskin and the rattle.*  

*Now the guy next door to me says he’s a houngan practicing some mojo called voudoun. The kid down the block slings his juju based on an old flat-vid superhero show. Seems like the longer the Sixth World goes on, the more there is to learn about how magic works. And believe me, you’d better learn it—’cause in this biz, what you don’t know can kill you.”*  
— Not Horatio, troll magician, Street Lectures Online  

*Awakenings: New Magic in 2057* is a sourcebook for *Shadowrun, Second Edition*. It revises and expands on existing rules for magic in *Shadowrun, Second Edition* and *The Grimoire, Second Edition*, offers new and expanded rules for adepts, and includes rules for the magical system of voudoun. It also provides players and gamemasters with a wide range of options for roleplaying magical characters and making magic an integral part of life in the *Shadowrun* universe.  

INTRODUCTION
Awakenings is a sourcebook for the Shadowrun game system. Intended as a resource for
gamemasters and players, it discusses in-depth the vast variety of magical manifestations in
the Sixth World from the point of view of the people who live there. Awakenings provides a
complete picture of the current state of magic in the Sixth World: how people see it, how shadowrunners and others use it, how physical and other adepts fit into the Shadowrun world, and
what the latest developments are. It also includes extensive material on voudoun, a form of
shamanic magic drawn from outside Native American and druidic traditions. In addition, the
book includes new spells and archetypes, as well as clarifying and expanding on existing rules
from Shadowrun, Second Edition, and The Grimoire, Second Edition. No other sourcebooks
are necessary to use Awakenings, though gamemasters will find The Grimoire, Second
Edition useful.
Like other Shadowrun sourcebooks, Awakenings is formatted as an electronic document
from that fictional world. Scattered throughout the document are comments and additions
from readers anxious to correct, expand, corroborate, or contradict the information it presents.
Because this "black" information comes from characters within the game universe, players or
characters cannot safely assume that these comments are truthful, accurate, considered, or
clearly thought out (though they may be all those things). As usual, individual gamemasters
may determine the accuracy of the information contained in this book.
The Gamemaster Information section contains new rules for various magical phenomena
described in the fictional sections, as well as expansions and clarifications of existing rules.
Many of the new rules are optional, and gamemasters should carefully consider their potential
impact on game play before using them in a Shadowrun campaign. As always, the gamemaster is encouraged to use this new material in the way that best fits the needs and capabilities
of his gaming group.

WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT MAGIC
Brought to you by the
American Association for the Advancement of Thaumaturgy
Do you believe in magic? It's hard
to imagine that only a few decades ago
most people would have answered
"no" to that question. Since the
Awakening in 2011, magic has
become as much a part of our lives as
the weather and trideo. Nonetheless,
for many people magic remains a
somewhat mysterious force, shrouded
in centuries of folklore and misconceptions.
This public-access file is designed
to clear up the confusion about the
magical arts and those who practice
them. To help you better understand
magic as a part of our world, it provides basic information and answers
the most commonly asked questions
about magic. By dispelling some of the
misconceptions surrounding the magical arts, we hope to promote understanding among magicians and nonmagicians, so that we can all be better
neighbors.
Welcome to the Age of Magic!
What is magic?
Many modern magical theorists
define magic as "the art and science
of causing change in conformity with
the will." In other words, a magician
uses his willpower and imagination to
effect changes in the physical world.
The magician accomplishes this feat
by connecting with a parallel universe
known as the astral plane. Through
this connection, the magician draws
mana from the astral plane. He then
uses his willpower to shape the mana,
which creates an effect in the physical
the Awakening: The period marked
by the emergence of magic, metahumans, and paranormal creatures. The
Awakening is generally accepted to
have begun following the sighting of
the Great Dragon Ryumyo in Japan
on December 24, 2011.
parallel universe: A universe that coexists with the physically observed
universe and remains undetectable
by existing means of observation and
perception.
astral plane: A theoretical parallel
universe that is the source of all magical energy and the medium through
which it travels. See articles on Kano,
Aikiko and White Eagle, Arthur.
mana: An impersonal supernatural
force that permeates the universe.
According to the theories of Kano
and White Eagle, mana is the primary energy that comprises astral space
and powers all magic.
endanger the magician's health:
Channeling excessive amounts of magical energy can lead to physical exhaustion, headaches, and dizziness. In
extreme cases, physical injuries such as
internal hemorrhaging, neural shock,
and muscle spasms may result.
world. To put it more simply, the
magician imagines something, then
draws on energy from astral space to
make it happen. The magician's use of
magic, however, is limited by his ability to draw on the energies of astral
space and his strength of will.
Excessive use of magic is exhausting
and can even endanger the magician's health.
What can magic do?
Theoretically, magic can do anything. In practice, the effects of magic
are limited by the conditions of the
work, the training of the individual
magician, and the amount of power
available to him. Casting a spell to turn
the moon into cheese is theoretically
possible-if the magician can form an
effective magical link, if he can channel
enough energy through it to affect
such a massive object, if he can focus
the mind fully on such a large and
complex target, and if the magician
can channel that much power without
overloading his system. All those "ifs"
make turning the moon to cheddar a
virtually impossible task.
Despite these limitations, magicians can use magic to perform amazing feats: sensing things beyond the
range of the five senses; healing
injuries; creating illusions; and animating, creating and transforming
matter and energy. Individual magicians may accomplish even greater
feats by joining with other magicians
and combining their abilities through
ritual magic.

What is the astral plane?
The astral plane is another dimension, separate from but existing in the
same space as the physical world.
Magicians have the ability to see into
astral space and form "bridges"
between the astral and physical dimensions that allow energy from the astral
to cross over into our world.
The astral plane is a place of energy and emotion. Studies suggest that
entropy is reversed in astral space, so
that a tiny amount of energy in astral
space can generate a tremendous
amount of force in the physical world.
As a result, the small amount of neural
energy a magician uses to cast a spell
may release a large quantity of astral
energy into our universe.
Astral space has much the same
geography as the physical world, but
objects in astral space appear as reflections of the life force and emotional
energy they contain. Although astral
space is similar to the physical world in
many ways, it feels quite different to
those who experience it. To give just
one example, written language cannot
be seen in astral space.
What makes someone a magician?
No one is entirely certain why
some individuals have magical abilities
and others do not. Numerous theories
attempt to answer this question, and
each magical tradition has its own
methods for selecting new students.
We do know that the ability to use
magic is a talent some people are born
with, just like the ability to draw, sing
or excel at sports.
This talent can be detected with a
fair amount of accuracy by a series of
simple tests developed by Dr. Etienne
Dumas in 2027. Dr. Dumas is well
known for his statement that "magicians are born, not made." He theorized that some genetic basis exists for
magical ability, but this theory has not
yet been proved.
How can I become a magician?
First, take a reliable test (such as
the Dumas test) to determine your
level of magical talent. If you have
amazing feats: The results of any
application of magic can be calculated with a precise formula known as
the Carroll Curve. The Carroll Curve
predicts the combined effects of
available magical energy, the concentration of the magician, the quality of magical links, any enhancements and distractions, as well as a
variety of other factors.
ritual magic: A form of magic requiring extensive props and preparations
intended to focus and intensify magical energy, allowing greater feats of
magic to be performed without
increased risk to the magician.
entropy: The natural tendency of all
things toward disorganization and
breakdown through the dissipation of
energy.
Dumas: Dr. Etienne Dumas (b. 1981),
Professor Emeritus of Occult Studies
of Sorbonne University, Paris. In
2027, Dumas oversaw a groundbreaking study of the development of
magical ability in homo sapiens.
Subsequently, Dumas developed a
series of tests capable of measuring
magical aptitude in (meta)humans.
adepts: Adepts are magically capable individuals whose abilities are
limited compared to those of magicians. Adepts possess a variety of
different abilities and ranges of
capability.
rising each year: According to the
2055 World Census, the percentage
of magically active persons in the
world rose .43 percent since the previous year's survey.
shamans: Shamans are magicians
who follow a tradition known as
shamanism. Shamans believe they
already taken such a test and the
results were negative, you should
probably consider another career. Just
as a tone-deaf person does not have
much chance of becoming a successful
musician, someone who shows no
magical aptitude is likely to do poorly
as a magician.
If you have magical aptitude, you
may wish to begin formal training. Be
aware, however, that learning to be a
magician involves long, hard hours of
study and mental discipline, just like
learning any complex science.
Developing magical skills involves a
considerable investment of time and
effort.
How many magicians are there?
Magicians are fairly rare. Statistics
show that about one person in a hundred has enough talent to make active
use of magic. Of those individuals, only
about one in ten are fully capable
magicians, while the others are adepts
or untrained Individuals. Approximately three to four million fully capable magicians exist today, and studies
show their number is rising each year.
Are there different kinds of magic?
Magic is a universal force that
works essentially the same anywhere,
so the answer to this question is nothere is only one kind of magic.
However, there are many different
kinds of magicians. Although magic
itself does not vary, different people
practice magic in different ways, just
as different musicians may create different music with the same type of
instrument. Shamans and mages are
two different types of magicianseach type follows a magical tradition.
Many magical traditions exist, but
ultimately the abilities of all magicians
are basically the same. For the most
part the differences are a matter of
style.
Are there evil magical cuits?
Magic itself is neither good nor
evil. It is simply a tool. Like any other
tool, an individual can use it to do
good or bad. Magicians have the same
human weaknesses and strengths as any other individuals-some
may use magic to hurt, while others may use it to heal.
Evil magical organizations such as those depicted in trideo
programs are purely fictional. Many magicians belong to magical
groups, but only a few magicians belong to "cults." Most cults follow dogma that prohibits magicians, but occasionally a cult will
form around magicians who abuse their abilities. Therefore, it is
important to recognize the differences between honest professional and social associations of magicians and the few misguided groups that tend to give magicians a bad name.
What are spirits?
More complex than spells, spirits are patterns of magical
energy capable of independent action directed by their summoner. Magicians can summon spirits from astral space and "program" them to perform specific tasks.
Some spirits are highly sophisticated entities that possess
high degrees of intelligence. This has led many observers to claim
that spirits are sentient beings, although many theorists dispute
such claims.
What should I do if someone has put a spell on me?
Generally speaking, you are much more likely to be struck by
lightning than to be targeted with a magical spell. If you have
strong reasons to believe that you are the target of hostile magic,
you should seek out the advice of a properly accredited specialist
and report the incident to the local authorities immediately.
What are magical items?
Magical items, or foci, are rare and specialized items used
by magicians when performing magic. True foci are of no use to
non-magicians and should be handled only by capable magicians. The so-called magical items that most non-magicians
come into contact with are usually worthless items hawked by
unscrupulous conmen. Many people lose considerable amounts
of money every year on such swindles, so make sure that anyone from whom you purchase magical goods is properly
accredited and licensed.

care. Honestly. So whoever sent that spirit to my house can just
call off the damn thing. It's driving me nuts.
Yeah, I know what you chrome-jocks are thinking (I thought
the same thing). Magicians on the Matrix? Nulllll ... But I'm here to
tell you otherwise, chummer. Contrary to popular wisdom (hah!),
not all magic-wielders are technophobes who live in gloomy, isolated towers where they read dusty, leather-bound tomes of
arcane lore by candlelight. Truth is, most magicians these days live
pretty much like everyone else. I'm good friends with a practicing
mage. He lives in an apartment, not a hidden tower. His magical
library is on multimedia optical chips, not parchment. He drives a
car and for the most part looks like anyone else you might run into
on the street (in some of the meaner areas of the metroplex, anyway).
derive their magical power by linking their
emotions, will and faith to the natural world
through a figure known as a totem. The totem
exemplifies the shaman's beliefs and way of
life.
mages: Mages are magicians who follow the
hermetic tradition. A mage sees the universe as
a pattern of abstract forces and energies that he
can control through complex formulae and
symbols of power.
tradition: A magical tradition is a body of
beliefs, theories and rituals governing the learning and use of magic. Numerous magical traditions exist in the twenty-first century, and each
teaches and uses magic in its own unique fashion.
magical groups: Magicians join magical groups
to study, educate others, and advance themselves professionally. Initiatory groups exist primarily to help improve the members' magical
abilities and are considered separate from other
associations.
spells: Spells are magical formulae and
processes that cause certain predetermined
effects when performed by magicians. Spells
enable magicians to shape and manipulate
magical energy to produce specific effects in
the physical world, such as levitating items or
freezing water.
foci: Foci (plural of focus) are enchanted items
designed to enhance the user's magical abilities. Foci have many functions and take many
different forms.
"OK. Cap. But what about shamans? They're all nuts, aren't
they?" You're not saying it out loud, but you're thinking it, aren't
you? Wrong again, kids. Sure, there are some back-to-the-landand-our-tribal-heritage shamans, but most of them still have refrigerators, telecomms, homes with indoor plumbing and yes, even
trideo sets. Shamans are more connected with the natural world
than a lot of us other folks, but don't believe all the stereotypes
you see on the trid. Some shamans, you'll discover, are as technosavvy as anyone.
Which brings me to this post. I know the 'Trix like the back of
my hand, but about spells, astral space, and other magical doings
I know diddly. So I contacted a friend and asked him to do some
digging. I leave the magical research and magical talk to my
good friend Talon-he will be your guide through the ins and outs
of the magical world of 2056. Sit back and enjoy the ride!
Oh, and treat him with respect. If any of you drek-for-brains

deck. Didn't think I could do that, did you? Well, even us mundanes have a few tricks up our sleeves.) <<<<<

and their fascinating file on "everything you want to know about
magic" ? Now you know what a nose-picking 3-year-old knows about
the subject. Congrats! Jeez-whenever I read that drek I think of that
old line, "With friends like these, who needs enemies?"
As I went searching through files to find out what you all might
be interested in, I kept a few things in mind. First, I chose personal
and professional accounts. Second, I chose drek of interest to
magic-slingers and mundanes (hey, we all live in the same world).
Third, I made sure this post talked about magic from the street, not
from some dusty tome or a bunch of anal-retentive magical
"scholars" from some oh-so-prestigious school of thaumaturgy. I
wanted the raw stuff. I hope you'll find it useful. Hopefully you'll
learn a few things-I did.
For those of you who run in the shadows, remember-magic
is the unknown. Sure, you can use it to smite your enemies (as the
ancients used to say), but they can also use it to smite you. Magic
is the great equalizer-magical or mundane, it don't matter. In a
blink you can come so close to death that the River Styx is soakin'

about magic-but the following is what we do know. So pay

THE WAYS OF MAGIC
>>>>>(Nobody can say for sure what makes one person a magician and another a mundane.
We don't really know if it's genetics, environment, training or some combination of all of three
that makes someone capable of performing magic. We do know that magicians are different
with a capital "D." Frag, magicians might as well be from another planet as far as most folks
are concerned. But that doesn't change the fact that magicians-and magic-are a fact of
life in the twenty-first century. Like it or not, folks on the streets have to deal with us. You can't
deal with something you don't understand, so I asked a few friends to post some drek that may
shed a little light on why magicians are the way they are, how they think and what they're like.
I also culled some files on my own to give a few more viewpoints. The files are pretty short, so
I've made them read-only to keep them readable. Any comments you jokers want to add will
show up at the end of each file.) <<<<<

BEYOND THE ODD COVEN
by Finn
Most people who watch the trid can tell the difference between mages and shamans-or
so they think-thanks to weekly episodes of The Odd Coven. Mages are the fantasy-wizard
types with their arcane diagrams, ritual chants, wands and pentagrams. They're hopelessly
neat, organized, compulsive control freaks. Shamans are the back-to-nature types dancing
around out in the woods and calling up the spirits of the rocks and trees. They're party animals
who swill home brew, never bathe and live in tents that look like an Indian garage sale. Well,
it ain't necessarily so. The mage/shaman split is true as far as it goes, but it's not as simple as
The Odd Coven's caricatures make it out to be.
Anyone above the age of eight knows that mages don't all run around in pointed caps
and flowing robes, and that not all shamans sport animal skins. In fact, mages and shamans can
include people from all kinds of magical traditions: druids, witches, nature magicians,
voudounistas, santieros, kahunas, kabbalists, tzaddikhs, miko, esoteric elven traditions, and
just about anything else you can imagine. That said, however,
there is a real difference between generally hermetic and generally shamanic ways of doing magic.
At its base, all magic is the same. (Plenty of mages and
shamans reading this are going to scream at me for saying that,
but all the yelling in the world doesn't change the truth.) Magic is
ultimately a universal force, and certain things about it are true for
every kind of magician everywhere in the world. Magic is as universal an art as painting or writing and as universal a science as
psychology. So what's the big squawk about the "hermetic tradition" and the "shamanic tradition"? Just this-magic may be universal, but the ways we see it are not. And because the way we
see it determines what we can do with it, up to a point the tradition we follow matters a lot-not in the sense that one tradition
lets us do more powerful or "better" magic than the other, but in
the sense that a tradition means something specific to each individual magician. A tradition is the source of a magician's training
and therefore of his power. Magic depends on faith and force of
will, and so the magician has to believe strongly in the ideas of his
tradition for his magic to work. No surprise, then, that magicians
tend to get attached to their own particular way of doing things.
Most of the differences between the two big magical traditions boil down to style and attitude. Even when it seems like one
tradition can do something the other can't, appearances can be
deceiving. Take summoning spirits, for example. Hermetic mages
like me see magic as a collection of elements that are the essential building blocks of everything, and so we summon spirits that
manifest as elementals. Shamans see magic as the forces of
nature, and so they get in touch with nature spirits. At first glance,
it seems like each tradition can whistle up entities that the other
can't-but again, it ain't necessarily so. After all, the difference
between a river spirit and a water elemental is largely a matter of
opinion. Which one is "more powerful," or somehow works better, is a nonsensical question. They both suit the needs of their
summoner perfectly well, and that's all that counts-especially in
a tight spot on the streets.
If I had to sum up "the hermetic tradition" in one sentence, I'd
say we're the ones who want to know exactly how things work.
Hermetics want to see all the puzzle pieces and figure out how
they fit together. We like systems, definitions, formulas. It's possible to use magic effectively without having a clue about how it
works, but a hermetic finds the "how" of magic endlessly fascinating. Think of the hermetic as the guy who designs the programs on
your cyberdeck or terminal. Any slub can make the thing work perfectly well by pushing the right buttons-he doesn't have to know
why they work. The programmer, though-the mage-knows precisely how and why Joe Slub got the result he wanted. The mage
knows the whole process, step by step. That's what draws a magician to the hermetic view of the Art in the first place-an interest
in the process as well as the outcome.
As much as we love to figure out processes, we also like to
talk about them. Shop talk's got to be the average hermetic's
favorite pastime, because debates about the workings of magic
enhance our ability to use it. There's a joke that if you put ten hermetics in a room and ask them what magic is, you'll get ten different answers. You'll also get a noisy, lively, wide-ranging debate
about everybody's opinion from every conceivable angle. No hermetic I know has ever told another, "You're just wrong about
magic and that's that." We listen to each other. We give and take.
We have to-if we're not learning from it, all the talk is just talk.
Magic is learning as well as doing, and the learning never stops.
I know some people call us cold and mechanical. They say our
preoccupation with systems and workings makes us see the universe as a machine, without life. But that's not really true. If I say a
plant's leaves are made up of molecules, which in turn are made up
of protons and electrons, and that all these things are arranged in a
specific pattern that makes the leaf a leaf, I'm not saying it's any less
alive. I'm not saying the plant is like the engine of my Nightsky or
the firing mechanism of an FN-HAR assault rifle. The way I see it,
being aware of the molecular pattern of a plant leaf makes me appreciate its aliveness even more. The pattern is a beautiful thing, like a
fine piece of music, and it helps make the plant what it is. Same thing
with magic-perceiving the patterns that underlie a spell or the
metaplanes adds to the wonder of experiencing and using it.
>>>>>(You want wonder, chummskis, initiation's the way to go. I
went through my first initiation just a few months back, and you
wouldn't believe the drek I can do now that I used to just dream
about. I can quicken and anchor spells, I can center my power so I
don't get so fragging drained every time I sling magic, I can even go
places in the astral that I didn't know existed! Man, it's amazing! I did
my ordeal in Salish-never mind where-going into the woods and
surviving all on my lonesome for fourteen days and nights. At sunrise
on the fifteenth day. I suddenly felt this incredible ecstasy and I knew
I'd made it. I felt my connection with my magic getting stronger right
at that moment. I happened to be walking by the edge of a lake.
and I sat down on the bank because my meatbod was pretty fragging tired. I looked into the water, at the sun shining on it like rose-colored fire, and the next thing I knew I was swimming through astral space. I mean swimming-it felt like water all around me, and I was a fish. I had a tail and fins and scales and all. I was swimming in the middle of a whole school of fish, and as soon as I saw the other fish around me I could see the patterns we were making in the water.
Bright lines of light connected each fish to every other fish, and every time the school moved the pattern changed around-like a kaleidoscope. Then one fish leaped out of the water into the sunlight,
pulling the rest of us with him. I saw a drop of water dripping off the fish in front of me, and all of a sudden I was water. I was one of those little droplets, with sunlight shining all through me, making rainbow patterns on the ocean surface below. When I plunged back into the water, I became a dolphin. A bunch of other dolphins came to join me, and welcomed me to the Plane of Water. I'd reached the metaplanes, and boy did it feel good!
When I got back to my body, the sun was just clearing a little copse of trees on the far side of the lake. I didn't feel tired anymore, or hungry, or anything-just happier than I've felt since I was
a little kid.) <<<<<

really got interested in alternate consciousness and mystical ways
of thinking. Most of it was just bull, of course-new ways to separate gullible saps searching for meaning from their hard-earned

actually had valid magical theory in it, but so mixed up with absurdities that it was practically useless.
What's really funny is that since the Awakening, some of the

BECOMING PRAIRIE DOG
by Marina
>>>>>(Here's the other half of the mage/shaman divide.) <<<<<
-Talon (21:23:56/01-10-57)
When I was young, I knew nothing of magic. I knew I could
speak to the sunflowers that grew outside our kitchen door. I
knew how our house cat felt when it bit into a mouse's throat.
And I knew that colors blew in every gust of wind. But I didn't
know that any of this was magic.
I first knew I had magic when I got lost on a family picnic.
Mom had sent me to my cousins' for the summer-we couldn't
leave the 'plex because Mom needed her job, but she tried to get
us kids out of the Sprawl any chance she could. I was about ten or
so, old enough to know better than to wander off. But I wandered
off anyway. The sky was calling me, so I kept walking farther and
farther away from my aunt and brothers and cousins. They were
sleeping, lulled by the warm sun and bellies full of cold chicken
and fry bread. I'd lain down to sleep too, but sleep wouldn't
come. Instead, I kept hearing the song of the sky. So I followed it.
I don't know how long I walked. I climbed over a few small
hills- hardly hills at all, really, more like wrinkles in the earth. Tall
grasses waved all around me, and I could just see the top of the Mile-High Tree. It wasn't really a mile high, of course-it was just
tall and older than even our grandparents could remember. That
huge old cottonwood marked the boundary of the reserve, and
the sight of it should have warned me of how far I'd come.
Instead, I just kept walking through the grass.
All of a sudden, the grass fell away. I stepped out into a huge
space of bare earth, which was covered all over with deep holes.
From the corner of my eye, I saw something pop up out of one of
the holes and then vanish. It was gone even before I'd finished
turning toward it. Something else flashed out of another hole at
the edges of my sight, then disappeared. The same thing kept
happening-I would see a flash of movement and turn toward it,
only to find myself looking at empty air. Then I heard barkingtiny yipping sounds that seemed to come from the earth beneath
my feet. I was getting angry by this time. Something was playing
tricks on me, and I didn't like it. So I stamped my foot and yelled,
"Come out or go away! Quit teasing me!"
The barking stopped. Then something popped out of the hole
right in front of me. It was small and sleek, its head shaped like an
otter's and with teeth almost like a beaver's. It stood up in its burrow, stretching tall and thin. Then it jumped out and sat at my
feet, suddenly becoming round and fat. It looked up at me with
bright eyes, brighter than any ordinary animal's.
"Would you like to play?" it said. It-she-sounded just like
me, another little girl.
I was so startled, I blurted out the first thing that came into
my head. "I don't know."
The prairie dog-for that is what she was-shrugged. "Take
your time," she said. "All my brothers and sisters want to play.
too. But we'll wait for you." Then suddenly she looked past me,
off to my left, and her gaze grew sharp. She stretched up tall
again, then leaped past me and pounced on a beetle.
I watched Prairie Dog eat the beetle, trying not to think of
anything but the question she'd asked me. After a while, I made
up my mind. I squatted down in front of Prairie Dog, looked into
her eyes, and yipped.
Prairie Dog yipped back, then leaped up and dashed across
my shoulders. When she touched me I felt myself growing small
and fat and furry like she was. My hands and feet stretched into
claw-tipped paws, my long black hair turned to short fur of pale
brown that flowed all across me. I was becoming like Prairie Dog.
Prairie Dog laughed at me and disappeared down her hole. I followed her down deep into the earth, where a hundred brothers
and sisters gathered around me and wished me welcome.
My memory gets hazy after that. I know my oldest brother
Tomas found me sitting in the middle of the tall grass, right by the
Mile-High Tree, and carried me back to our pickup. My aunt scolded me a little, but she could tell something had happened. She
had magic herself, though not so strong as mine became. I cried
all the way back to the 'plex, frightened that I had left Prairie Dog
behind forever.
Three days after we got back, I was crossing the vacant lot
next to our apartment when Prairie Dog popped out of a hole in
the asphalt. Twenty brothers and sisters popped out of the
ground behind her. "What are you staring at me for?" she said.
"You didn't really think we'd leave you, did you?"
Then Prairie Dog leaped into my arms and I held her tight. She
melted inside of me, becoming a part of my flesh and my bones.
When I undressed for bed that night, I saw she had left a pale brown
mark in the shape of her small body under my collarbone.

drek-a cup of soykaf, a screwdriver, whatever. That's part of her
totem's nature too-just like prairie dogs connect with each other
by building tunnels, she connects with people by giving and taking drek. Sounds strange, but it works for her.) <<<<<

animal totems, or come from Native American cultures. Friend of
mine from Tir na nÓg's a druid-she follows the Oak totem, of all
things. Don't anybody call her tree-hugger, though, unless you
want one powerful lady ticked off at you. (Oak druids are incredibly patient-not a good thing if they don't like you, 'cause they
don't mind waiting years for payback.) She says the land of the
Tir-Eire, she calls it-carries magic in its bones, in the stone circles
and sacred groves and mana lines. The way she scans it, druids
have always been around and just keep doing what they've
always done-guarding the land, protecting it from harm, restoring it wherever they can. My friend's particular way of doing this is
to plant oak trees, among other things-especially on corpowned land that the Powers That Be are trying to use for other
things (which snarks the corps off no end). She gets in trouble a lot,
but she deals with it. Boy, does she deal with it.
A while back, a few fools-for-hire made the mistake of attacking my friend near her own sacred circle. They wanted to teach
her the error of her eco-conscious ways, and they didn't know as
much about druids as they should have. Silly fraggers thought
they'd caught her unprotected because they ran her down under
the open sky-no medicine lodge or hermetic library in sight, so
they figured she was handicapped but good. So my friend, she
steps inside the bounds of her sacred stone circle and uses its big
ol' power boost to conjure the biggest motherfragging storm spirit I've ever seen. You know the old cliché about the heavens splitting open? It happened. The skies just tore right across, like so
much wet cloth, and jagged lightning bolts ripped toward the
poor fraggers on the attack. The spirit killed three outright-three
others fled. The last two stood their ground and tried to cast spells.
but they couldn't see well enough to do frag all in the driving rain.
One of them finally managed to conjure a mountain spirit that
might have posed a problem for a garden-variety shaman, but
not for my friend. You know what they say about druids and banishing-they can get rid of a spirit faster than a cheap blind date.
I can personally tell you it's true. Don't know why they're so
much better at it than other kinds of shamans, but I
leave that kind of question to people who like
to pribble on about magical whys and
wherefores. Me, I know what I see and |

connection with our idols (who are not gods, though they are
powerful and beautiful beings), and affirm our friendship. We are
thirteen in number-seven women and six men, which gives us six
couples and a priestess. This balance of gender mirrors the balance of Nature, which we all strive to preserve and reinforce.
Indeed, maintaining that balance with the help of our idols is the
central truth of our existence. Our magic, our "worship," if you will,
is about love and caring and healing and joy, not about hating or
making war. We do not like the corporations much, but we reserve
our anger for their actions. The people themselves-the executives, the wage slaves-are as deserving of our love and care as
any other living creatures, and many are in greater need of it
because they are so misguided. We use our magic to correct their

GROWING UP MAGICAL
I always knew I was different, even as a little girl. I have distinct memories of moments as a child in school or with my friends
when I felt ... distant, I suppose, is the best way to describe it.
Separate. Apart from the whole scene, like I was watching it all
from far away. It's not that I had an unhappy childhood, don't get
me wrong. But I wasn't a typical kid. I didn't have lots of friendsnot real ones, anyway. I had a lot of imaginary friends as a kid. I
used to hold tea parties for them and talk to them all the time. My
parents thought it was a cute phase and didn't want to "stifle my
imagination," so they didn't try to discourage me. I would play for
hours by myself in my own secret world. Now I know those times
were my first taste of magic.
In school my teachers didn't know quite what to make of me.
One day they'd be labeling me "gifted," the next they'd be telling
me I needed to pay attention more. They told my parents I had
attention deficit syndrome (or whatever multisyllable name they
gave daydreaming at the time) because I'd get so wrapped up in my
own thoughts that I'd lose track of what everyone else was doing.
Still, I did well in school for the most part and did all the normal
childhood things. But I never quite lost the feeling of being different.
I discovered the Art when I was a teenager. I had a few
friends over at my parents' house for a sleep-over, and we were
talking about all sorts of things-especially boys. We spent half
the night discussing such weighty issues as which boy at school
was the cutest and who was interested in whom. Somehow we
got on the subject of love spells and decided to try a spell from
one of those children's books on folk magic. It seems so simple
and harmless now, but I remember feeling a funny kind of thrillas if we were doing something forbidden. As I recited the words
of the spell, my skin started tingling and I felt warm.
Suddenly there was a bright flash and a muffled bang. It startled us so much that my best friend Julie screamed bloody murder. My parents came rushing down to see what was going on,
and both of them started laughing when we told them about the
spell. Nothing really happened, but they took it seriously enough
to schedule a magical ability test for me the following week. I
waited impatiently for days for the results to come, all the time
wondering if I could possibly have the ability to do magic. When
the test results came back positive, my parents were as pleased
as if I had won the Nobel Prize. They took us all out to dinner that
night. I told my little brother he'd better watch out or I'd turn him
into a toad one day.
After that, I started taking special classes at school. That's
where I learned the basic magical theory and concepts that
helped me understand the changes I began to experience as my
talent started manifesting itself. I threw myself into the classes-I
loved every minute of them. Only ten kids in our high school
attended magic classes, and our teacher said that I had one of the
strongest talents of the bunch. I was proud of that.
My friends joked a lot about my being a magician, but I could
see it made them nervous. I was becoming more sensitive to what
people felt and thought (not reading minds-I didn't know any real
spells at that age), and I could sense their discomfort when I talked
about learning magic or sensing something that they couldn't. I lost
my best friend Julie in my second year of high school. I had just started dating a boy and Julie kept telling me how happy she was for
me-but I knew she was jealous and resentful. She couldn't help it,
and neither could I. A lot of people I knew didn't care for my
increased "sensitivity" either and stopped hanging out with me. I'd
never asked to be magically gifted, or ever meant to hurt anyone.
But they all started treating me like some kind of monster, or like I
was stuck-up. At the same time, a lot of kids who'd never talked to
me before started acting like they wanted to be my best friend.
Usually they wanted me to cast a spell for them or something. When
I'd tell them I didn't know how, they'd call me a fake and laugh nervously, hoping inside that it was true. A couple of guys I knew (real
drekheads) started calling me "the witch" just loud enough for me
to hear when I passed them in the halls or the lunchroom.
To make a long story short, I ended up hating high school
with a passion. I stuck to my own small circle of friends, most of
whom were also Talented. Most of my mundane friends eventually drifted away. No one ever treated me like just another kid, and
that's all I ever wanted to be back then-just another kid, just like
everyone else. I tried really hard to fit in, but after a while I just
gave up. I threw myself into my magic studies and spent most of
my free time practicing.
By graduation, I had accepted an occult-studies scholarship
from a notable university. College was like a whole different world
to me. I made new friends and grew fascinated with my studies.
Most of my newfound friends were in the OS program, too, and
our dorm was nicknamed "the tower" by the student body
because it housed most of the magic majors. Some considered it
more of a hazard to house us all together, but it usually worked
out to everyone's advantage.
After I graduated from college, I took a job with the magical
resources department of a certain corporation and began work on
my master's degree. My department at the corp was like a smaller version of my college dorm in a lot of ways. We all stuck
together pretty close while the rest of the company stepped very
quietly around us. I liked the respect we got from the rest of the
company, but everyone in the department quickly tired of management's frequent requests that we "magic up" things on a
moment's notice to compensate for other departments' failures.
After my younger brother's death, I saw my parents less and
less. Once I had become a magician, he got it into his head that he
must have the Talent as well-and he couldn't take no for an answer.
He took a magical ability test when he entered high school and
failed. Within months, he committed suicide. My parents never
openly blamed me for his death, but I couldn't help noticing the pain
on their faces every time they saw me wearing a fetish or focus or
performing the smallest spell. Eventually I saw them only on major
holidays. When an opportunity for a better job came along with
another branch of the company, I took it. Nowadays I send my parents e-mail on special occasions, and we exchange presents on
birthdays and holidays, but we don't really see each other any more.
I guess that's part of the price all magicians must pay. We're
different, after all, and once you start down the path of magic
there's no turning back. I may sound bitter or cynical, but I have
no regrets. I've felt the power as a spell I've woven takes shape
before my eyes; I've spoken with spirits as old as time and traveled to worlds filled with wonders that stagger the imagination. I
have stared into the face of my own darkness and come away
stronger-and I wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.

STREET MAGIC
by Goblin-Boy
Corp wage mage? No thanks, chummer! I slipped out of a silk
corp noose once already, and I ain't stickin' my head in one again
for all the cred in the Zurich-Orbital Gemeinschaft Bank.
I was born in the Barrens, and if it weren't for my magic I'd
still be there. I'd probably have joined a gang and ended up like
my brother. I won't bore you with the story of my early childhood-let's just say it didn't leave me with a lot of pleasant memories. I was just another SINless kid in the Barrens, with no real life
to look forward to, until I met Grimley.
Grimley was a weird old ork who lived in my neighborhood,
the stuff of local legend. He was a mage and a cranky old recluse
to boot. Every kid in the neighborhood (and plenty of adults, too)
had a story about Grimley's strange habits and secrets. Everyone
had ideas about what old man Grimley did in his run-down shack
in the wee hours of the night when nobody was looking, but no
one really knew for sure.
It's funny, but no one ever actually saw old Grimley do any
magic. I mean, everyone knew he was a mage, but he didn't look
like any hotshot spellslinger and he never seemed to do anything.
If I were a mage, I thought, I'd be doing drek all the time. After a
while I started figuring maybe Grimley was a fake-maybe he just
told everyone he was a mage and they all believed him. One day.
I decided to prove it.
I can't tell you what I saw when I snuck into his house, cuz he
made me promise never to tell anyone. I can tell you it scared me
so much I fraggin' drekked in my pants. Grimley came home just
then, and it's a good thing, cuz I didn't know what to do. I
thought he'd be mad, but he just stood in the doorway for the
longest time, holding his sides and laughing like a maniac. After
he made sure I was okay, he sat me down in his kitchen, gave me
lunch, and asked me questions about magic. Then he asked if I
wanted to learn it.
I couldn't say a word for a minute or two. I just stood there
with my jaw hanging open, replaying Grimley's question in my
head like it was my favorite scene in some Toonland simchip. I felt
like he'd asked if I wanted to be king or something. I couldn't
believe it. Grimley said he thought I could sling it-he figured fate
had dropped me in his lap, so he ought to do something about it.
When I got my voice box working again, the first word out of my
mouth was "yes."
A couple of times I almost quit. Grimley had me doing all
kinds of drek that I didn't think had anything to do with magic.
He'd make me sit still for an hour at a time to learn how to concentrate. Or he'd make me help him around the house while he
talked, telling me what magic was and what it was about. Most of
it seemed too simple to be true. I thought magic was a lot more
mysterious than the old geezer made it sound. Anyway, he didn't
really show me anything for a while.
Once he thought I was ready to handle it, he taught me how
to see into astral space. Totally freaked myself out the first time I
did it, but it got easier each time. I remember when he took me
into the astral for my first journey out of my meat body. It was the
most incredible thing I'd ever done-I still remember it like it was
yesterday.
You've probably heard or read something somewhere
about what being in astral space is like-"I floated in a realm
of endless light" or "I felt free of my body and truly pure for the
very first time." Well, that's bulldrek. Didn't feel like that at all
to me. I felt so solid that I didn't believe I'd left my body
behind at first. Grimley had to show me. We were standing in
a little gray room, and I said, "Okay, so when do I leave my
body?" Grimley gave me a look like he couldn't make up his
mind whether to laugh or smack me one. Then he made a door
in the gray wall-just reached out his hand and grabbed a
doorknob that suddenly appeared-and opened it. I looked,
and saw Grimley's kitchen. The two of us were sitting at the
beat-up old table, him leaning back in his chair and me with
my head on my arms like I was asleep. What really convinced
me that I was seeing our meat bodies and not just some weird
vision was the fact that my left elbow was resting in a plate of
ketchup. I just happened to be wearing my fave synthleather
jacket, so I was looking at a major tragedy. No way I'd've
dreamed up that little detail.
Then Grimley asked me where I wanted to go. I said I wanted to see my mom. I didn't know exactly where she was-I
couldn't keep track of whose house she went to on what days.
Grimley told me to think of Mom, then open a door. I stretched
out my hand like he'd done, and felt the doorknob kind of congeal
under my hand. One minute there was space, the next a chunk of
smooth metal. Weird. Anyway. I opened the door and walked
into the fanciest living room I'd ever seen. Polished wood and
glass everywhere, gleaming in the sun. Fancy trid-sim combo set
all across one wall. Couch cushions made of fabric so shiny and
stiff you'd slide off if you sat on them. And my mom, spraying the
inside of a glass door to a cupboard full of big-nuyen junk and rubbing the dust off with a ripped-up towel. The really wiz thing
about it was, Mom was the brightest thing in the whole room. I
don't mean literally bathed in light or any of that drek-but somehow, everything about her just looked more real. Her hair had
more shine to it, the colors of her skin and her clothes seemed
more vivid, her outlines seemed sharper. Everything else looked
faded next to her, like old 2-D snapshots left in the sun.
We didn't stay long-Grimley said that wouldn't be good for
me the first time out. I got worried about getting back to my
meatbod, since I hadn't been able to tell when I left it. Grimley
told me to think real hard about my left pinkie finger. Sounds
lame, neh? But I did it, and suddenly I felt this jolt like a bus stopping too quick. Next thing I know, I'm stretching out the kinks in
my neck and cursing the ketchup stain on my jacket. I felt real
tired, and a little dizzy. It was dark outside, but Grimley made me
stay and eat a sandwich before I went home.
I studied with Grimley a couple of years. He could be a real
hardcase sometimes and I'd get fragged off at him, but he took
everything in stride-which made me even madder. As the years
passed, I started to worry about my family more. Mom wasn't
getting any younger, and her work wasn't getting any easier.
She'd leave home in the morning when it was still dark out to
clean house for the high-class SINners uptown, and she wouldn't
get home until after dinner time. My brother had a job for a while,
but then his gang got involved in a turf war and his arm got
chewed up real bad. The street doc had to amputate it. I started
feeling like some kind of loser, because I was spending all my time
studying with Grimley when I should've been helping out.
Then one day a corp recruiter contacted me. He'd heard
some buzz about my having magical talent and wanted to make
me an offer. He said his corp would pay me to go to UC Berkley
and learn magic. When I graduated, I'd have a job with the corp.
I told him I already knew magic and just needed the job, but he
said no deal. no school, no job. I didn't want to do it, but when
he told me how much the corp would pay me I signed on the dotted line. Grimley didn't say anything about it, but I knew he was
hurt. I felt bad about that, but I think he understood.
Learning magic in school was a whole different simchip from
learning Grimley's "whatever works" kind of style. For almost a
year all we did was read books on magical theory and history.
When we finally got to doing stuff, we did everything "by the
book," following steps created and tested by a bunch of corp and
ivory-tower spell slingers who'd set up standards for all kinds of
spells, rituals and workings. Once, when I finished a project using
one of Grimley's formulas, the prof marked me down for not following the right procedures. Right then, I started wondering if this
corp wage mage drek was really gonna work out.
In my senior year, my change came. I spent a couple of weeks
of drug-hazed pain in the university hospital as my muscles and
bones reshaped themselves. When I got out, I was almost a foot
taller and a lot heavier. No way could I pass for human. A couple
days later the corp told me that they no longer had any positions
available for entry-level mages. I should've been fragged off, but
I didn't really care. I had plenty of magic training under my belt
from two different but useful sources, and I was free to go wherever I wanted.
When I got back home, Grimley gave me all his grimoires
and tools and drek, and I started building a rep for myself on the
streets. It's sorta funny to think that I've got a good-paying "corp
job" after all, even though no suitboy'd ever admit to hiring me.
Best thing about it is, I can take or turn down any job I want. I
wouldn't trade that freedom for all the nuyen in the world. My
mom hasn't had to worry about money for a long time, and she
doesn't clean house any more.
I wonder if Grimley knew what I really was when he decided
to take me on and just never told me. Not that it really matterswhat's important is what he taught me, not why. Someday I'll
repay old Grimley the debt I owe him-some gutterpunk with an
itch for magic'Il wander into my doss, and I'll make him an offer.

UNORTHODOX TRADITIONS

pretty scary drek-magical traditions that people make up out of
their own heads, and views of it that are way out of the mainstream. I've drawn these accounts from police files, trid-show transcripts, and a longer posting from a chummer of mine that turned
up on this board awhile back. (I stayed away from the scholarly
tomes-no sense boring the ears off the people who really need
to learn this drek.)
The lead-off file gave me the willies, which is why I included it.
I know the author by rep-he's a fragging good forensic mage.
The Azroth story shows two things that
all you street slags desperately need
to understand. First, magic can work
in infinitely unexpected ways
depending on the user's point of view; second, magic can be fragging dangerous for people who

AZROTH THE GOD: CASE NOTES
by Friday
After a while, you become kind
of immune to the violence-any
cop'll tell you that. The department
shrinks say it's some sorta psychological protection-they call it desensitization. The pain, suffering,
death, hatred, cruelty-it becomes
like that piped-in background music
.
in all the arcologies-you simply
stop noticing it. I guess you'd fraggin' wig out if you didn't. Whatever
you wanna call it, it's worked for me.
Hell, I've been on the force for twenty-seven years now, twenty-two of
those working homicide. I can't
begin to tell you how many corpses I seen. But I can't get one of
them out of my mind. There's always one case that never goes
away-the Azroth case was mine.
It broke in L.A. about ten years ago, when joyboys and girls
from Venice Beach bars started turning up dead in out-of-theway places. Not the usual kind of dead, either-no BTL overdoses or fights over money that turned ugly. Something worse.
Some sick puppy had tied down the victims and dissected them
while they were still alive. Each one died at some point in the
process-no way to tell exactly when, or how much pain they
endured before they finally kicked off. Every body we found was
drained of blood and had its vital organs removed. The organs
were wrapped in cellophane and stacked in a little pyramid by
the victim's head, with the heart on top. Written in blood somewhere nearby-the only trace of blood we ever found-was the
name "Azroth." Real sick drek. Even sicker, I could sense that
this Azroth slot had drawn magical power from each death.
From the pain, too. That's why he did it-to give himself a mystical shot in the arm. He didn't call it that, of course. He had no
idea he was magically active-he just figured the power kick
was a sign from the Universe that he was turning into a god.
Catching him was some trick. He got so good at manipulating magic according to his own sick system, so attuned to the
higher uses of it, that he could wipe his astral "fingerprint" off the
bloody writing and every other trace he left behind. Without that,
we couldn't use ritual sorcery to identify or track him. We finally
got him with good old mundane forensic evidence-traces he'd
left on a note that he sent to the L.A. Times.
I talked to him a little after we brought him down. I'm still not
sure why-I guess I just needed to see this monster, hear him talk
about himself, to make sense of him. Didn't work, of course. He
couldn't make sense of himself. He kept yelling for his totem-he
had some word for it I didn't recognize, maybe he made it up.
He'd concocted a whole personal mythology, totally off the wall
and like nothing I'd ever heard of. The guy went and created his
own magical tradition, put himself through several grades of initiation, and came up with spells and rituals, all without knowing
what he was doing. He was convinced he was becoming a god
named Azroth, who would take the place of all other deities
known to metahumanity and then cleanse the earth of every race
so that Creation could start over.
He was psycho, of course. But his magic worked. That's what
still gets to me.

PSIONICS
"Magic is no more than a convenient term for what we might
as well call folk parapsychology, a primitive science that allows for
the harnessing of the human brain's inherent psionic powers to
manipulate the forces of the electromagnetic spectrum. In our
modern age, such techniques need to be refined and codified
through scientific study to make them more efficient than the folk
myths and rituals of a time long past."
-from The Reality of Magic, by Peter Isaac
That's magic in a nutshell, folks. Isaac sums it up. Forget all
the fairy-tale drek, forget spells and spirits and all that drek. It's
just your brain working its own "magic" on electromagnetic energy. (Go ahead, folks-flame me all you want. No skin off my nose
if you'd rather believe you're some fantasy-mage type with a
magic wand or "in touch with the spirit of Nature" instead of being
able to see the real miracle in the workings of the plain-vanilla
mind. To each his own, I say.) Ain't nothin' mystical about magic,
and it ain't new. It's ESP and all the other psychic drek, and it's
been around as long as human beings have. The only thing that's
new is that more people are aware of it and can use it. Why that
is, I don't know and I don't pretend to know. But then, I don't
think it matters.
Anybody remember a little nineteenth- and twentieth-century history? A few bright and curious people started wondering
about things like ghostly visitations, visions of disasters that came
true, people who could bend spoons or "hear" what other people
were thinking. Around 1880-something, they set up some society for the investigation of the paranormal, and the science of
psionics was off and running. These parapsychology guys figured
that the human mind had untapped powers-telepathy, psychokinesis and extrasensory perception (ESP)-that everybody
could learn about and use. Of course, they were up against a
whole society that had a real problem believing in anything that
couldn't bonk 'em over the head. For a long time, psychics were
either laughed at as fools or jailed as frauds because most people
couldn't believe that psionic powers existed. Nowadays, everyone knows they exist-but a lot of folks have no idea what they
really are. Nothing much changes, neh?
Here's an example of psionic magic-assensing. Assensing
is clairvoyance in action. I do it all the time, finding missing persons for my local branch of the Star. How it works is, they give
me something-a bracelet somebody always wore, a murder
weapon-and I use clairvoyance to look for changes in that
object's electromagnetic energy. No spells or conjuring or any of
that mumbo jumbo-I just pick up the thing and read it. With a
bracelet, the energy of the person who wore it "imprints" the
thing and tells me something about them. I'm reading their
energy pattern, just like somebody might read body language or
expressions on a face. Once I know what that pattern feels like,
I can find it-and the person it belongs to-anywhere in the
world. If I read a murder weapon, the violence of the act
imprints everything connected to it-the weapon, the site.
everything. That imprint tells me something about the person
who used the weapon and also shows me the crime. Of course,
I don't get the whole picture perfectly every single time.
Reading the information is only part of the story-once my psychic mind picks it up, I have to translate it into images or impressions that my conscious mind can understand and communicate
to other people. Sometimes I goof up, thinking it means one
thing when it really means another. Most of the time, though,
I've got a pretty good batting average.
As for spell-throwing, that's pure psi manipulation of electromagnetics to cause a physical effect. I once "cast a flame bomb
spell," as your average magician would call it. Me, I call it good
old pyrokinesis-using psi power to move electrons and drek
around to make fire burst out of thin air. (You gotta keep in mind
that "thin air" isn't really the same as "nothing," like most people
think. Air's made up of molecules and electrons and protons and
whatnot, just like everything else. You wanna make something
come out of thin air, just play around with its particles until you've
got them in the pattern you want. Laws of Nature take over from
there.)
I know, I know-what about spirits? How can they be some
psi power? Simple-they're not. What they are is something
somebody makes up to "explain" his own psi ability. "Gosh, I didn't move that 100-pound rock. I told my earth elemental to do it."
Some people just aren't comfy with the idea of having powers
that society has always told us didn't exist. Other people get
creeped out by the thought that their frail little bodies can hold
enough power to affect the big bad world, and so they project it
on to something outside themselves. Whatever, it's still them
doing it.
Not that there's anything wrong with believing in spirits, if it
makes it easier for you to use psi. The powers themselves may
work under the laws of physics, but there's no rule that says psychics aren't allowed to make up whatever stories they want to
explain how their talents work. What gets to me, and the whole
reason I'm even contributing to this post, is everyone's insistence
that psi is "really" this big mystical bundle of weirdness and
impossibilities called magic. That kind of thing scares people, or
else makes them refuse to believe in any of it because it all sounds
so fragging silly. Us psychics have been fighting for centuries
against that kind of fear and ridicule, and we're tired of it. Witch
hunts, demonizing, "tell me what I'm thinking" parlor tricks ...
we've been dealing with all those things. And now, just when
enough people are tapping into psi abilities to finally give us a little respect, along comes the fairy-tale establishment bent on making us out to be Cinderella's fairy godmother or something. There
is a scientific basis to this drek, folks. Just remember that. Have
your nice stories and your spells and your spirits if you want to,
but remember that they're just pretty fiction. They're tools to help
you use psi better, but they're not reality.

like mind probes, control thoughts, illusions, manipulations, and
detection spells. No coincidence that the effects of all these correspond pretty closely to "psi powers" like telepathy, psychokinesis, and garden-variety ESP. Because the so-called psi powers can
do a lot less than magic can, self-defined psychics tend to place
subconscious limits on their abilities-technically they can do
whatever any other magician can, but their mental block is so
strong that in reality there's a whole bunch of drek they can't pull

MAGIC AS MIRACLE
-Excerpt from a broadcast of Praise Be to God, hosted by
The Reverend Jeremiah Warren, PBG Network, 2056
Welcome, brothers and sisters, and thank you for tuning into
Praise Be to God, broadcast direct from the Holy Temple in Eufala,
Alabama. Before we start tonight's program, I'd like to take a
minute to address a grave matter that has come to my attention.
I'm certain that some of you have heard on the news today the
accusations that I, Jeremiah Warren, pastor of the Holy Temple,
host of Praise Be to God and a humble servant of God, have built
my career through the use of magic.
Yes, I know it's shocking, my dear friends in the Lord, and I
know that none of you good people would ever believe such lies
and fabrications. It is true that I have performed miracles during
my ministry, but those miracles are the work of God. The laying
on of hands, the speaking in tongues, the healing of the sick and
lame, the casting out of demons and flights of the spirit-all of
these are the work of God, Who has simply channeled His power
through me, his servant!
No, my brothers and sisters, I am not the enemy. The true
enemies are those who accuse me of using magic, Satan's black
art, to lead the innocent astray! For they are false prophets who
strive to destroy the servants of the Lord and lead his flock to eternal damnation!
Sadly, there are those who are vulnerable to such lies and
fabrications, who would believe the venom spewed by the Lord's
enemies. God commands us to fight to save these poor misguided souls before it is too late! We must join together so that we can
help them see the Truth and recognize His holy word that they
might be saved! Join me in this holy war by calling now and
speaking with one of our operators. Yes, God commands each and
every one of us to join in the fight, so call now and have your cred
number available, and together we can smite this unholy challenge-praise be to God!

brought up, folks don't call it the Talent-they call it the work of

them of the "evil.") <<<<<

Jeremiah's mama and papa told him that magic was the work of

was consciously aware of. Then one day, while he was at a prayer
meeting, he started speaking gibberish. He went up to his old
lame grandma and laid his hands on her. Presto, she's walking
around! That was the first of his "miracles." He talks about it in his
book. Pretty soon everyone's telling him that he's gifted, that
God's takin' a shine to him. He's no longer afraid of his talent-he
understands it as the power of God working through him, because
he has no other framework in which to understand or use it. Next
thing you know he's performing "flights of the spirit" (astral projection), "rites of exorcism" (combating spirits), and a whole range of
other "miracles.") <<<<<

Talent altogether in such a culture, but plenty are able to use it.
Their spells take the form of prayers and invocations, often spoken
in arcane tongues such as Latin, Aramaic or Hebrew. They may
use holy books and religious symbols as fetishes or may even
unconsciously enchant them to serve as foci. Salt, wine and holy
water serve as ritual materials and expendable fetishes, and these
magicians derive their geasa from religious imagery or practicesholy symbols, prayer, ancient languages, fasting, holy ground such
as a church, temple or mosque. Almost all of them are self-initiated, usually after some greater spiritual enlightenment, fasting,
prayer or vigils that serve the same function as ordeals in common
initiation rites.) <<<<<

good man and his holy message. And they'll be more than ready
to help him out by sending in their nuyen.) <<<<<

Granted, the Awakening shook many to their foundations. But it

magic. Most organized religions now recognize magic as separate from religion and view it as a blessing from God. The leaders
of the Catholic Church, for example, describe magic as a tool of
Humanity-quite a switch from the suspicion and condemnation it
historically directed against the thaumaturgical arts. Of course,
the debate over miracles and magic still rages. In fact, there's an
order of mages and adepts-I think it's called the Order of St.

determine whether they are true miracles or manifestations of
magic.) <<<<<

ALL DRESSED UP AND NO PLACE TO GO
by Burnout
In case you couldn't tell from the handle, I'm a burned-out
mage. A onetime wizard. A sad-sack spellcaster who's lost the
juice. Misplaced my mojo, squandered the stuff, just let my magic
drain away because I was so fraggin' sure that I was smarter than the
Universe. I wasn't. Too bad for me, I had to find out the hard way.
You've seen me before. I'm a stock character on the trid-the
object lesson, the cautionary tale, the guy whose pathetic existence reassures the norms out there that magicians are all on the
brink of losing it. "Don't be afraid of Mister Super-Shaman-he'll
burn himself out someday soon, and then he'll be less than nothing." The funny thing is, for once the tridmeisters got it sorta right.
It ain't true that every magic man is gonna burn out-the smart
ones don't. The ones who learn about the limits that go with the
Talent and live within them-they don't burn out. Only slags like
me, who figured our magic made us the next best thing to God,
lose the gift we were born with. But the schlock-sellers are right
about the less-than-nothing part. That's how I feel, most days. I
guess I should be grateful not to feel that way every fraggin'
minute anymore.
Can you imagine what it feels like to go slowly blind and deaf,
losing your sight and hearing so gradually that you don't even
notice until the day comes when you absolutely have to see 20/20
or hear perfectly and you can't do it? You used to see colors, but
now the world is gray. You used to hear music and laughter and
conversation, but now the world is dead quiet. And you're not
even sure how it happened. You just realized one day that the abilities you once took for granted aren't there any longer. They died.
And part of you died with them. That's what burnout feels like.
Imagine you're a decker who can't slip the electrons anymore because a slow-growing brain tumor scrambled your wetware. Or a street sam who gets some nerve disease that gradually makes you lose control over every muscle in your body. You've
lost the thing that made you who you are, the thing you lived for
most. Magical burnout is like that, only worse because it doesn't
come from a tumor or a disease. We do it to ourselves.
It started for me after a real bad run, where two of my buds
bought it and I came fraggin' close to taking an APDS round in the
gut. The corpsec slag missed by about a millimeter, and not
because of any spell I'd cast. I was too busy dodging fireballs and
taking out the combat mages to spare any mojo for the gunnie,
and the gunnie fraggin' near did for me. Blind luck I stepped aside
when I did. After that I decided I was tired of being the biggest
target on the team (they teach the corpsec boys to geek the mage
first, ya know!), and I knew my magic alone couldn't keep me safe
when the lead started to fly. So I thought it was time to do a little
work on the old meatbod. Cyber-something, I wasn't sure what.
Just something to make me stronger, faster, tougher in a firefight.
I knew what everybody said about magic and cyber-that the
metal would take away my sacred spirit or some such bumf and
frag up my magic-but I decided I didn't believe it. All that "life
energy" drek was a bunch of mystical jetwash-only the slubs
who ran around in wizard's robes and tall pointy hats would
believe it. A hardcase runner like me? I'd never lose my edge.
And anyway, I only wanted one little thing. Not enough to frag
me up bad, if the mystical jetwash turned out to be true.
So I got my cyber-boosted reflexes, so's I could dodge
slugs faster. And it slowed me down, magic-wise-but not much.
Sure not enough to bother about. But because I couldn't sling the
drek quite as fast as I used to, I started slipping up. Gave myself
a bad scare or two, and after that I decided I needed more cyber.
Something to make me tougher this time. Enhancements.
My magic got even slower. And it started to drain me wicked
bad-after some runs, I could hardly stand up for a week. I felt like
I had a bad case of the flu, only I couldn't throw up because I
couldn't get anything down in the first place. It was too much
fragging effort to eat. Looking back on it, I figure I'd pulled my
energy so out of balance that my meatbod couldn't cope.
Whatever, I started missing out on runs. That meant missing out
on cred, which I couldn't afford. I had to get back in biz somehow,
but my magic wasn't gonna do it any more. So I took an easy little job as soon as I could, and made the Johnson pay me with a
trip to a cyberclinic. When I came out, I was all cybered up and
ready to rock. But my magic was gone.
At first I tried to tell myself it didn't matter. But it did. I'd walk
down the street feeling like my head was wrapped in cotton
gauze-I saw things through this grayish haze, and all the usual
'plex noises sounded far away. I thought at first it was something
physical, so I got cybereyes and cyberears-but it didn't go away.
A mojo-man friend of mine explained it to me, finally. My eyes
and ears worked fine, but my brain was so used to having extra
input from the astral that it translated the missing data as hazy
vision and muffled sound. It'd clear up sooner or later, he said,
and it mostly has. Some things haven't, though. I keep trying to
assense things like I used to do by instinct, and I give myself a
splitting headache every time I try. It's kind of like the stories I've
heard of guys who lost arms before we had cyber replacementsthey knew the arm was gone, but they'd keep trying to grab
things with it anyway.
So now I'm a street sam, I guess, without a scrap of magic.
Which is an okay thing to be, except that everything I ever learned
about the streets or the biz or myself had magic at the heart of it.
All my moves, all my strategies, all the drek I used to do automatically because I took it all for granted-that's all gone. I'm starting
over, just like a baby learning to walk, only I'm a pretty fragging
clumsy baby. I'm not doing too well. I've gone from a top-gun
magicker to a fourth-rate sammie, or maybe worse. Some trade. If I
had to do it over again, I wouldn't. And you shouldn't either.

Nearly every runner knows all about big guns. Not many seem to realize that you can turn
someone into a ball of fire with a spell as well as a flame thrower-and a spell is a helluva lot
easier to carry around, smuggle through customs, slip past a corpcop-you scan? (Of course,
most spells won't leave a bulge in your pants, either, but if that's your bag I'm pretty certain
you can whip up some mojo to do the job.) Seriously, a skilled practitioner can use modern
magic to frag with someone in any number of nasty ways. On the other hand, magic can be
used to patch up injuries, which can come in quite handy when you're in the middle of a fire
fight and don't have time to wait for the DocWagon boys.
Anyway, here's a sampling of the goodies in the modern magician's arsenal-mojo that
you can use and mojo that might be used against you.
>>>>>(Before BlackStone's enthusiasm carries us away here, let me just note one little thing ...
magic is not the easy substitute for guns that he's making it sound like. Know why? Every time
a magician slings a spell, he takes physical damage. He gets hurt. He may suffer no more than
a ten-second nosebleed, but he will hurt somehow, some way. So go ahead and use a spell in
place of an assault rifle if the situation warrants, but remember the price you'll pay for that
choice.) <<<<<

SPELLS
Spells are probably the most common kind of mojo a magician is gonna throw at you. Not
that anything about spells is common. A magician's arsenal may include all kinds of ways to
frag with you, either physically or by using mana. And because most magicians like to create

THE MAGICAL ARSENAL
their own, the odds are a magician is gonna have some spell up
his sleeve that you've never seen before. Of course, there are also
some tried-and-true spells that people use over and over again;
like someone once said, never mess with what works. That said,
here's a little overview of the spells you're most likely to
encounter.
PHYSICAL SPELLS
For all the newbies and curious mundies out there, physical
spells affect physical things. That means anything from the cells of
your meatbod to the surface of the plascrete wall you're propping
up. Physical spells can be useful-or trouble-in all kinds of situations; I'll describe the ones I've used or seen used most often.
Anyone who's got a trideo set is probably familiar with those
wiz-looking flame/fire spells-abracadabra and POOF !- you're
burned toast. Those turn up in all kinds of forms: fireballs, fire
bolts, fire darts, flame bombs, et cetera. They're real popular, partly because they do a lot of damage and partly because they
appeal to the Inner Pyromaniac in every (meta)human being.
>>>>>(A very flashy way to cack a target. Can be quite effective
as a psychological weapon, too. I'll never forget the first time I saw
someone use one of these. I was a young innocent gutterpunk,
roaming the streets of the Barrens with my chummers and watching for pedestrians to accost. One day we came on a slot walking
down the street and thought we'd have some fun. We all figured
the guy was just some old derelict-had no weapons we could
see, old clothes, kinda mumbling to himself as he walked along.
We pulled our old van up alongside the curb and Crank, our selfappointed leader, hung out the window.
"Hey you fraggin' piece of drek, what the hell are you doin'
walking' through our turf?" Crank yelled at him. The old slot just
ignored him. Kept walking along, looking at the ground the whole
time. "Hey you old drek-eating slot, I'm talking to you!" Crank continued. The old guy just kept walking along, ignoring Crank's
taunts. That seemed to enrage Crank, who jumped out of the van.
Big mistake, that was, but Crank didn't have much time to think
about it. He took about two steps toward the old guy, who turned
his head to look at our fearless leader and then BAM !- Crank
turned into a ball of fire.
For a moment we just sat and stared at the writhing mass of
flame. The old man stood motionless, a blank expression across his
face. Then he looked at us, let out a sigh and asked, "Okay, who's
next?“
That's when we got the frag outta there.) <<<<<
-Nicky (03:21:09/01-15-57)
Ram spells are another fave, especially among those who
don't necessarily want to geek their target. A ram spell damages
inanimate objects, so the less bloodthirsty among us can use them
to mightily inconvenience the opposition by caving in the walls
right in front of them or crumpling up the front end of the lead cop
car in a chase. (The more bloodthirsty among us like to tumble
walls down on top of people, or blow out a tire at just the right
time to cause a fatal accident. How far to go with it is your choice,
chumley.)
Of course, physical spells do more than just blow things up
real good. Combat sense, for example, is a physical spell that
makes you (or whoever else you cast the spell on) hypersensitive
to dangerous situations-you start sensing events a split second
before they occur, which means you react that much faster. That
kind of edge can really save your butt when the drek goes down
sudden-like. Other fun physical spells are the kind that let you
change the environment-like laying down an ice sheet under a
platoon of sec-guards, or throwing a stream of acid at the cyberboys pounding along behind you. For those who prefer less lethal
tactics than that last one, chaos and chaotic world spells are perfect; you throw one and suddenly the target is surrounded by
flickering lights and shadows, bombarded by weird noises, et
cetera. Most times, all that chaotic light and sound'll stop 'em
dead in their tracks. (It stopped me once, and fraggin' near cost
me my life. That kind of effect is tough to ignore.)
>>>>>(And let's not forget the flying-objects school of sorcery. The
sight of a public telecom ripped off its post and flying through the
air at high speed at you can be pretty unsettling, even if you
dodge it. Or how about the slot who levitates a vital object-like
the gun slung across your back, or your wheels?) <<<<<

scam on me. My buds 'n' me'd knocked over a local joint and were
zippin' away with the credbox when I look in the rearview and see
some snot-nosed kid with greasy hair dashing outta the place yellin'
his head off. The kid makes this scoopin' motion with his hands, and
alluva sudden our van's floating inches off the ground, wheels spinnin'. We couldn't do nuthin' but sit there, too fraggin' scared of
breakin' our necks to jump out, while the sirens got closer and closer. If I ever find that kid, I'm gonna scrag 'im.) <<<<<

MANA SPELLS
Mana combat spells use mana-magical energy-to physically damage a target. They may not be as impressive looking as flame
spells, but they'll geek you just the same. Like flame spells, mana
spells can be used to hit a single unlucky runner or an entire area.
One popular spell among those who like to deal death up close
and personal is a nasty one that goes by the street name of death
touch. Yep, this puppy does just what it sounds like-a spellworm
using death touch can kill a target just by touching it. Even nastier
cousins of death touch are slay spells that affect specific races or
species. Personally, I've never gotten much use out of these on a
run, but I've lost a few chummers to slay spells in the past (which I
won't go into-this ain't the place for it). Let's just say that antimetahuman freaks like the Humanis Policlub boys really love these
("Say, you still got that slay elves spell handy?").
Mana spells can also frag with a target's perceptions, just like
the physical spells I mentioned above-always a useful thing on a
shadowrun. Used against you, these are every bit as much of a
hoop-frag as fire bombs. Don't believe it? Then you try aiming
straight-not to mention thinking straight-when you're feeling
thousands of tiny little things crawling over every inch of your
body or your vision suddenly becomes so sensitive that starlight
hits you with the force of a megawatt flashbulb in the eyes. I've
created those particular effects with overstimulation spells (my
personal favorite-it lets me unleash my natural creativity, doncha
know). Oh, and don't forget masking spells. IMHO, these are the
most useful mana spells anyone's ever come up with. Magicians
can use masking spells to alter the appearance of people, objects,
vehicles-just about anything.
>>>>>(My chummer Sluggo just loves to use masking spells. He's
one big motherfraggin' troll with a wicked sense of humor. Once,
we needed to get some info from a particularly close-mouthed
corp suit. Problem was, we had to do it real quietly. Good ol'
Sluggo, he tails the slot for a few days, notices that this guy likes to
cruise the clubs for blond joygirls. The next thing you know, the guy
starts seeing this new in-fraggin'-credible looking chica hangin' at
the El Mocambo. Seven feet of lean, mean, white flesh clad in
black thigh-high leather jackboots and not much more-drek, the
guy couldn't help but following her around like a dog. Anyway,
this woman-Monika-she toys with him for three nights. Let's him
buy her drinks, dance with her-but she won't let him touch her
and each night she goes home with someone else.
By the fourth night, he's chompin' at the proverbial bit, strainin' at the leash. She knows he's hooked, but she just carries on as
usual. Every now and then she looks at him and her lips curl into a
little smirk. After an hour or two, she says she's bored and starts
heading to the door. The guy just sits at the little table, like he's in
shock or something. Then she looks back over her shoulder and
asks him, "Are you coming?"
Fifteen minutes later, they're up in the penthouse of a local
hotel. At Monika's command, Mr. Suit relieves himself of his clothes
and lies on the overstuffed, oversized bed. She barks at him to lie
still and shut up-which he immediately does-and she ties his
wrists and ankles to the bedposts with some latex straps she's
pulled out of her purse. She slowly strips down to her boots, climbs
on top of him, then asks, "Are you ready?"
He nods his head vigorously.
She smiles at him and suddenly SHAZAM !- "Monika" drops
her masking spell and Mr. Suit finds himself looking up at the smiling face of a seven-foot troll!
Needless to say, Sluggo got the slot to talk.) <<<<<

The mana spells I really hate-because I've had them used on
me-are the ones that control the target's thoughts, emotions,
and actions. Nothing feels weirder than some spellworm messing
with your mind or jerking you around like some puppet. I lost a
girlfriend that way once. I went on an out-country run-someplace in Scotland, never mind where-and my squeeze couldn't
tag along because she had a little biz of her own in Seattle. So I
go off to Scotland, and we spend a few nights in a local bar sniffing around for info and contacts. One night I get to chatting with
this barmaid, who doesn't shy away from me like most mundies
do because she's got a little something on the magical eight ball
herself. Also, she looks a little bit like my squeeze, and I'm feeling lonesome. Now understand one thing-talking to her was as
far as I meant it to go. Putting the moves on someone during a
run isn't smart-it distracts you from your job. So I'm talking to
this girl one night, and she casts a spell on me. All of a sudden I'm
wildly in love with her. She's my Dream Woman, my perfect fantasy. Nothing about her changed-but the way I saw her turned
around 180 degrees. (I found out later she was a lot more powerful a magic-slinger than I thought, and she had this jones for
American guys. Pulled this kind of stunt all the time.) Just for a
second, I recognized the spell for what it was-but then the emotions took over, and the rest of my brain went straight out to
lunch. I mean, it was all I could do to keep my hands off her in
front of everybody. She gave me this look, kinda gestured with
her head toward the door, and I was out of my chair and running
outside like a dog going nutso over a walk.
We had a great night, and I had a rotten morning. The spell
had worn off by then. I woke up feeling all warm and comfy, with
this warm body curled up next to me, and for a second I thought
I was home. Then I opened my eyes and turned over, and realized
I was in this strange squat with paint flaking off the ceiling, staring down at this chica that I did not remember taking home. The
last thing I remembered clearly was finishing my beer in the bar,
and her smiling as she asked if I wanted another. To top it all off,
I looked at the clock by her bed and saw that I was an hour late
for the meet with my team. I got out of there without waking the
chica, and took a lot of flak from my buds (who weren't any too
pleased that I'd made them look bad by being late).
So I thought that was that, except that my so-called friend
Flipper was so mad about me almost screwing up the meet that
he decided to tell my squeeze everything. When I told her I couldn't help it, that the chica'd used magic to make me feel something
that wasn't real, my squeeze just gave me this look and said,
"Blackie, if you'd wanted to fight it you could've. You didn't. What
does that tell you?" And the hell of it was, she was right. Sure, a
magicker can control your emotions with a spell-but if the wizworm tries to make you feel something that goes against your
grain, you can fight the spell's effects. That's a good thing to
remember if you plan on using this kind of spell. You might not be
able to make somebody shoot his best bud with it, but you can
distract the hell out of him by trying. Every second he spends
fighting that impulse is a second he's not shooting at you or your
friends-and lots of times in this biz, a few seconds makes a difference between a good run and a hoser.
>>>>>(A ganger wizboy tried a control spell on me during a turf
fight-the stupid slag tried to make me shoot myself in the foot.
There wasn't any emotion, though. He just took control of my
arms. Weirdest thing I've ever been through, watching my own
arms move to point my rifle straight down and not being able to
do frag-all about it. I fought off the juice before the ganger could
make me pull the trigger. A mage buddy of mine explained later
that it's real hard to make somebody's body do something that'll
hurt them-the brain tends to object, and sheer willpower can
break the spell.) <<<<<
-Cowboy Bob (22:13:41/01-25-57)
COUNTERING SPELLS
Unless you're a magician yourself, there's not much you can
do to counter a spell. For a lot of spells, magicians need to see
their target, so getting out of his line of sight sometimes works. If
that's not practical, you can geek the mage.
>>>>>(Never get caught between wizboys tossin' juju at each
other. I'm a street sammy, so I been in some bad firefights before.
Man, give me flying lead any old day over flying mojo-I'll prob'ly live longer.
It was a ganger fight-or at least, that's what I thought it was
gonna be. I was hired muscle, in it for the pay (which was pretty
good for a buncha gangers. Guess that shoulda made me suspicious.). So me and the rest of the muscleboys on each side face
off and start shootin' and pretty soon my side's lookin' like winnin'.
The slot next to me sees he has a clear shot at the opposition's
lead ganger, and he lines it up sweet. Me, I'm already closin' my
fingers over the credstick.
Suddenly the slot next to me flies up in the air and goes sailin'
into a brick wall, like some giant invisible hand picked him up and
threw him. To my dyin' day, I won't forget the crunch of his skull
against the brick. Left a little dark spot behind when he slid down,
dead as a beetlehead's brain cells. Then two more guys on my
side suddenly go up in flames. I see a little knot of gangers on the
other side, in synthleather jackets with little moons painted on 'em,
standin' real still while slugs whiz right at 'em and flatten out about
a foot short of hitting 'em. It dawns on me that they're magicboys,
and that my side's hosed. Now I got no real stake in this fight 'cept
my cred, and I figure it ain't worth much unless I'm alive to spend
it-so I step outta the front lines and start to run away. Just so happens my escape route takes me past another little group of
gangers-and in the middle of 'em, playin' with his fingers and
with a glazed look on his face, is the slag who hired me.
I stop, tryin' to figure which way to go-I thought the slot was
gearing up some mojo as payback for me takin' off. Then he makes
this throwing motion toward the other gang's magicboys. Suddenly,
one guy's jacket catches fire. He screams and drops to the ground,
rolling around to put the flames out. The rest hardly miss a beat-they
close ranks, then start mumbling and dancing around and stuff. One
of 'em gives a shout, and my employer drops to the pavement with
a blackened, bloody hole where his chest used to be. The wizboy
next to him flicks his fingers, and a stream of acid shoots outta
nowhere and hits the oppo leader in the face. The stream passed
close enough to me that a drop of it hit my aim-it burned like pure
fraggin' hell. The slag casting it wasn't even aimin' at me, and I got
hurt anyway. I ran then. I didn't wanna see no more.
I still got a scar on my arm, the size of an old-time quarter. I
look at it every time I'm tempted to take a job where mojo might
be flyin'. Me, I'm sticking with gunfights.) <<<<<

FOCI
Magical items can be a shadowrunner's greatest advantageor greatest liability if you don't know how to use them. Under the
right circumstances, foci can provide just the right extra punch to
get something done (nothing beats a good mageblade for taking
on some magical nasty, trust me). And some tasks are simply
damn near impossible without the right foci.
So what's the problem, you ask? First, active foci leave you
vulnerable to astral attacks. Foci are like little beacons in astral
space. They may draw all kinds of unwanted attention from
guardian spirits, patrol magicians and wards-and at the same
time give the nasties an opportunity to strike at you. That's why
smart magicians don't use all their foci all of the time, no matter
how many foci they've bonded.
>>>>>(I've also heard that astral creatures such as wraiths are
attracted to the astral emanations of magical items. A good reason to keep those foci powered down or masked.) <<<<<
-Hex (00:35:08/02-01-57)
But focus addiction is even more dangerous. Foci can make a
magician lazy. They boost a magician's abilities, providing a leg
up, magically speaking, that makes performing certain kinds of
magic easier. It becomes real tempting for a magician to rely on
his foci and not exercise his magical abilities. And without regular
exercise, that magical ability gets "flabby" and doesn't work as
well. The next thing you know, you start to pile on more foci to
make up for the loss in your abilities. You become a "focus junkie"
and need a bigger focus "fix" to do the same work. Eventually you
end up a burnout case, fumbling with all kinds of wands and powders and scrolls to cast a spell that once you could have tossed off
with just a flick of your fingers. A pretty sorry state.
>>>>>(Magicians who do most of their magic through foci are
often called "mechanics" by other magicians. The purists may
scoff at them, but that doesn't mean that they aren't capable of
tossin' some serious magic around.) <<<<<
-Tanner (16:15:43/01-22-57)
>>>>>(This focus addiction drek is pretty scary. Why bother using
foci at all? Why take the risk?) <<<<<
-Tangent (02:19:23/01-22-57)
>>>>>(Because foci are valuable and useful tools, They're only dangerous if a magician misuses or abuses them-like the magician who
carries around so many active foci that he looks like a bank of lights
at a fraggin' Urban Brawl stadium in astral space. A few tools, used
properly, are no concern. Remember, it's not the foci themselves
that are dangerous-it's how you use them.) <<<<<
-Necro (02:25:55/01-27-57)

THE MAGICAL ARSENAL
A smart magician uses foci sparingly and with the respect due
such powerful tools. Savvy magicians keep their foci powered
down until they need them. They activate a focus, use it and then
put it away. Doing it the right way takes a little extra time, and it
means that you won't be able to use all of your foci instantly. But
the loss in response time is well worth the extra security. If you
need to throw everything you've got at something on a run, you're
already hosed, chummer. Don't go in looking for trouble like that.

SPIRITS
Spirits are one of those magical phenomenon that thaumaturgical theorists love to argue about. Are they sentient? Where do
they come from? Do they have a separate existence? My advice is
forget about all that fancy drek. You find yourself in the middle of a
run with some heavy-duty spirit rearin' up to bite your ass and
believe me, you're not gonna care whether the damn thing's sentient, where it came from, or whether it has a separate existence.
Here are the things you should know about these beings. Read
carefully, this drek just might save your hoop someday.
First, some basics for you magical morons out there. There are
two types of spirits-nature and elemental. Both types can take
astral or manifest (physical) forms. Regardless of which form they're
in, firearms and explosions won't hurt them. That's right, you can
blast away all you want and Casper's just gonna laugh at you.
If a spirit's in astral form, you're only gonna see it if you're
astrally active. On the physical plane, you might spot it as a shimmering in the air if you're lucky. Fortunately, a spirit in astral form
can only strike at astral targets. Weapon foci are effective against
astral form spirits, but the user must be astrally active too.
Defeating an astral form in astral combat (easier said than done)
and banishing also work. In manifest form, a spirit can attack physical targets, but it also becomes vulnerable to physical attacks.
If you've got a magician on your team, let him deal with any
spirits you run into. If you have the bad luck to run into a spirit
without any kind of magical backup, my advice is run. Fast. And
don't look back. If that's not an option, then believe it or not,
hand-to-hand combat is your best bet. It's not actually the physical combat that makes the difference in dealing with the spirit, it's
the sheer will it takes to duke it out with a spirit in close combat
that gives you a chance of disrupting the spirit. A small chance.
NATURE SPIRITS
Nature spirits rarely take on any fixed form. Generally, they
tend to take naturalistic forms-a storm spirit might appear as a
THE MAGICAL ARSENAL
whirlwind, a sky spirit as a cloud. Sometimes they take on the
shape of their summoners, but their "bodies" are made up of
material from their domains. A forest spirit, say, might look like a
man made of twigs, leaves and mud. Only a shaman can summon
a nature spirit, and he can only do it in that spirit's domain. In fact,
the spirit only has power while it's in its domain. But as long as
you're in the spirit's domain, it can do some nasty drek to you. A
storm spirit, for example, can hit you with a fraggin' lightning
bolt-and there ain't no way to get outta the way of one of those.
A shaman might also send a nature spirit out to find you if you're
in its turf. And trust me, it will. It can conceal itself, slow down or
speed up your movement, fill you with overwhelming fear, make
you lose, your bearings and cause "accidents" in its terrain.
>>>>>(All you wannabe ghostbusters out there better listen to ol'
BlackStone here. He's not drekkin' you. Back in '54, me and my
pals pissed off a shaman down in old Central Park one night. First,
we got lost-even though we'd all run around in that park since
we were kids. The next thing you know, we're separated. I still
don't remember how that happened. After about three hours, I
gave up looking for my chummers and got my hoop the hell outta
there-which took me another three hours, it seemed. I went back
the next day and found Willy about three meters away from the
main trail. I chased away the pack of wild dogs that were breakfasting on him and saw he had stumbled on some old rusty spring
trap that nearly took his leg off. A little farther into the woods
Zonker was pinned under an old dead tree, with dried blood coming outta his mouth, nose and ears.) <<<<<
-Believer (02:11:59/01-25-57)
If you find yourself facing a nature spirit, you can try to escape
by leaving the spirit's domain. Move to the most different terrain
that you can find nearby. If you're on the street, say, run into a
park or jump into a river. Remember, lesser nature spirits are
bound to their domains and can't operate outside of them. Of
course, If you're fighting a powerful enough nature spirit-or
worse yet, a fraggin' toxic spirit-it'll be able to follow you anyway. But you'll feel better for trying. Or you can try to survive until
sunrise or sunset. A nature spirit summoned during day vanishes
at sunset. One summoned during the night vanishes at sunrise.
>>>>>(Wait a minute. How exactly does this domain thing work? If
a shaman's standing on the forested slope of a mountain under
the open sky, is he in a forest, mountain or sky domain? Could an
area be more than one domain at once?) <<<<<
-Domino (13:05:39/01-26-57)
>>>>>(Domain overlap is common, because Nature herself is multifaceted. A forested mountainside under the open sky could be any
of three domains: mountain, forest or sky. But by conjuring a spirit of
any one domain, a shaman magically identifies with that aspect of
the environment and declares-at that present moment-that the
environment of the summoned spirit is the "true" domain. If the
shaman then turns to conjure another type of spirit (without physically
moving from the spot) he has shifted his magical view of the landscape and (in magical terms at least) he has left the previous domain.
Two shamans in the same overlapping domain could each
take different views. One could conjure the mountain spirit to hurl
landslides at his foe, while another could summon a sky spirit to
assault him with storms.) <<<<<
-Watcher-of-Stars (04:18:20/01-27-57)
>>>>>(Sky spirits extend their domain anywhere outdoors, under
the open sky. The extreme limit of their reach appears to be the
terminator (since crossing that would constitute sunrise or sunset
and end the spirit's service).) <<<<<
-Silicon Mage (17:04:19/01-27-57)
>>>>>(If a shaman conjures a nature spirit and then leaves its
domain-or is removed from it somehow-does the spirit go
away?) <<<<<
-Tangent (20:11:16/01-28-57)
>>>>>(A shaman can conjure only one nature spirit in a given
place. But he can assign the spirit a service that continues past the
shaman leaving the domain, as long as the task doesn't exceed
the spirit's normal time of service (sunrise or sunset).
For example, if I'm running through the woods, I can call on
the forest spirit to conceal me and speed my passage. When I
reach the river I can call the river spirit to flood and block my pursuers and when I finally reach the highway. I can have a street
spirit ready with a truck with bad brakes for any of my pursuers
who make it past the river. Likewise, if I get jumped in my apartment, I can call the hearth spirit to deal with my attackers, then
scramble down the fire escape and have a city spirit waiting in the
alley for anyone who follows me.) <<<<<
-Tommy Dre (22:36:35/01-28-57)
>>>>>(Is a city spirit's domain the entire city or only one neighborhood or suburb? What about malls and sewer tunnels?) <<<<<
-Rakker (02:09:38/01-30-57)
>>>>>(A city spirit's domain is the entire town (for example, the
whole of London) but does not extend into the more specialized
niches within the city ecology. Interiors of buildings are hearth
domains; Hyde Park is forest and field, and so on. So while the city
spirit has vast reach, its domain contains blind spots and holes.
Malls (at least the ones I've been in) have hearth spirits, although
rather odd ones. Sewers fall under the reach of the city spirit, but
places in the tunnels where people have lived for a while tend to
develop hearth spirits.) <<<<<

ELEMENTAL SPIRITS
Hermetic magicians can summon elemental spirits from one
of the following sources-fire, water, air or earth. Typically,
mages use these spirits to help them sustain spells, or they have
the spirits perform physical services for them. A fire elemental,
say, might manifest and burn though a door at the command of
a mage. All elementals can engulf targets-a water elemental
can drown a victim, a fire elemental can cover a victim with fire,
and so on. Elementals can also nauseate and incapacitate targets, generate psychokinetic energy, and control the movement
of targets.
All in all, elementals make pretty versatile weapons. They're
not limited by domain and can pursue a target anywhere. The best
way to escape an elemental, believe it or not, is to get out of the
controlling magician's line of sight. If the mage can't see you, for
whatever crazy reason, neither can the elemental. (This trick works
for nature spirits as well, but not watchers.) Keep in mind, though,
that if the mage is using some kind of magical enhancementclairvoyance, say-or is in astral space along with the elemental,
the spirit (and the astral mage!) can follow you as you duck around
the corner or dive into a doorway.
Of course, escaping by ducking out of sight only works
against bound elementals. So how can you tell if the fire elemental that just manifested next to you is bound or not? Sorry, chumley, there's no way to do it in a snap. Only long-term observation'll give you the answer to that question. And let me tell you,
an elemental that isn't bound is one scary fragger to meet. A
bound elemental is limited; it does specific tasks within the line of
sight of the mage who summoned it. The other kind acts like an
astral hound dog. You can't run from it, you can't hide from it. No
one can call it off, not even the mage who summoned the thing.
You've got to kill it or dispel it, end of story.
This kind of elemental goes by a lot of names. Three I've
heard are spirits of death, astral Mounties (they always get their
man) and pit bulls. Not that it really matters what you call them.
Take my advice-get yourself some magical protection and some
astral warriors on your side, and maybe you'll live one more day.
And don't piss off your friendly neighborhood mage.
MAGIC AND HEALING
Throwing fireballs around and spying on targets from astral
space are not the only kinds of advantages magic can provide a
shadowrunning team. Spells that heal can also prove invaluable
on a run, especially when calling in DocWagon isn't practical.
Different spells can be used to help a runner resist pain, strangulation or suffocation; cure diseases; reduce the effectiveness of
toxins; protect against infections or disease; stabilize an injured
runner's condition; and treat wounds.
>>>>>(Damn straight on that one. I'd be dead right now if it
weren't for my spellcasting chummer, Wizzo. Back in '52. we were
part of team dropped into the Sioux Nation to perform a datasnatch for a very special client. For reasons I can't go into right
now, we had to perform the mission with basically no support at
all. Our client provided air transport to get us in, but after that we
were on our own. At first, everything went smoothly. We hit the target and got the data with no problems. We couldn't believe our
luck, which held until we got about five fraggin' miles from the
border, where we stumbled onto a Sioux Special Forces squad.
Thank the spirits we surprised them, or we would have been totally hosed. As it was, they got the stolen data, as well as Jones,
Longo and Arnold. Wizzo was bringing up the rear, which saved his
life. I lost my right arm and most of my right leg, and for a brief
moment I'd wished that I'd died like Jones and the others. Then
Wizzo calmed me down and used some spells to treat my wounds
and stabilize my condition. Thank the spirits Wizzo survived. There
ain't no way I ever would have made it out of there without those
healing spells.) <<<<<
-Rooster (07:21:09/01-18-57)
Although healing spells can be very effective and convenient
for a shadow team, it's probably best to use them only when mundane methods are unavailable. Otherwise, it's pretty easy for the
team's runners to develop "Superman complexes"-to start
believing they don't have to worry about getting all shot up
because their magician can just whip out a healing spell and make
'em all better again. This may not be a problem in most cases, but
if the team's magician gets geeked during a run the team could
be pretty well fragged. Also, any use of magic-healing magic
included-may draw attention from any astral security in the area.
So try mundane healing methods first and save the magic for the
times when you really need it.
>>>>>(Once again, BlackStone's conveniently neglected to
emphasize that any use of magic-no matter how minor-will
cause physical damage to the magician. Why do people keep
forgetting about this? I'm not just talking about the folks in this
post-I'm talking fragging near every slot who doesn't sling the
juice (and far too many who do, who oughta know better). Every
fragging time I go on a run, I have to deal with at least one damnfool street sammy or whatever who figures I should heal every hit
he takes, and never mind what all that magic use might cost me.
An awful lot of runners see magicians as practically expendableit's more important to heal the sammy so he can shoot up some
more guards than to keep the magician healthy. The sammy can
take any crazy risk he wants because he's got me back there to
fix him up-but who's going to heal me? Who's going to patch up
the damage I'm taking every time I sling a spell to keep the
sammy in fighting condition? Nobody, that's who. By the time I get
done healing my chummers-half of whom only got injured
because they took a stupid chance ("Who cares if I take a slug to
a vital organ? The mage'll heal me right up!")-I'm too drained to
heal myself. And if we're lucky enough to have a second magician on the team, he's gonna take just as much damage healing
me as I did healing everybody else. Net result's the same-one
magicboy down for the count. No way is that fair. Why do so
many runners think it's perfectly OK to harsh out the magician so
that everybody else can get off lightly? How come everyone
else's health and well-being is so much more important than
mine?) <<<<<

that magicians can do useful things like heal people. What're you
going to do, let the street sammy bleed to death because you'd
rather not get a nosebleed? How fair is that? I agree with you that
people shouldn't take magical healing for granted-anybody
who thinks that us spellslingers can keep throwing healing magic
their way without paying for it is an ignoramus in desperate need
of a little education. But you sound like you think nobody should
be asking you to heal them at all-like using your talent that way
is somehow taking unfair advantage of you. It's not, any more

HEALING MAGICIANS
Whenever a magician uses magic, he uses his own body to
create a "bridge" between the physical and astral planes. This
bridge enables him to channel energy from the astral to the
physical world and requires a very delicate balance between the
magician's astral form and his body. Any shocks to the magician's body-such as drugs, poorly healed injuries, and cyberimplants-can upset that balance. Even organic bioware throws
off the balance and reduces the magician's power-handling
capacity. Enough of a shock can permanently reduce the magician's ability to safely channel magical energy. For this reason,
anyone treating an injured magician has to be very careful. All
things considered, it's probably best to wait for professional
help for an injured magician. And it doesn't hurt to learn a bit
about the special considerations that come into play when treating a magician.
>>>>>[A lot of people don't know that most medical services like
DocWagon issue medic-alert tags and specially coded membership cards to magician clients. That way, when a trauma team
finds the subscriber unconscious they know to take the proper precautions. DocWagon's gotten into one or two lawsuits from magicians who claim that company employees acted recklessly and
damaged their magical abilities and their livelihood when treating
them.) <<<<<

PARANORMALS
Paranormal guard animals are one of the latest additions to
the modern magical arsenal. A few corporations and security
providers have experimented with paranormals for years now, but
the practice of using paramormal guard animals has achieved popularity only in recent years with the development of new training
and genetic-engineering techniques. In the past, paranormal guard
animals posed nearly as much danger to their handlers as they did
to intruders-and some people say they still do. Apparently, no
matter how much you train these animals they remain wild, unlike
dogs and other species that have been domesticated for thousands
of years. And a barghest turning on its trainer presents a bit more
of a problem than, say, a Doberman pinscher going bad.
The impressive capabilities of paranormals outweigh these
dangers, however, and now entire menageries of critters have
become a common sight on many company compounds.
Generally, they're used to provide security during night-time
hours. Typical choices for guard duty include barghests, basilisks,
cockatrices, firedrakes and piasmas. Hellhounds in particular are
highly prized because their dual nature makes them effective
against both astral and physical intruders.
>>>>>(Drek, there seems to be an unspoken competition among
the corps to see who came come up with the nastiest Awakened
critter. Some corporate facilities are starting to look like fraggin'
zoos.] <<<<<
-Whisper (23:41:50/01-25-57)
Lots of people think the only way to deal with these critters
is to blast away and haul hoop. Well, that's one way, but it's hardly the best-and hardly appropriate if you're trying to get into a
facility without setting off all kinds of bells and whistles. My
advice is do your homework. Find out what kinds of paranormals
you might encounter on a run and look them up in Paterson's
Guide. Find out the behaviors, strengths and any weaknesses of
the critter. Then think of ways you can use this information to your
advantage. Remember, paranormals typically have natural magical and physical abilities that far outstrip the abilities of any runner.
But runners (at least most of them, I would hope) have one advantage over paranormals-it's called intelligence. So don't try to
slug it out with these nasty little beasties-outsmart them.
Take the basilisk, for example. These critters have this wonderful little ability to petrify anyone that looks into their beady little eyes. So you get yourself some styling little mirror-shades and
you won't have to worry about no basilisk freezing you at an
unfortunate moment. Better yet, get yourself a little hand mirror
and you can reflect the lizard's gaze back at him-which, conveniently, will turn him into a little basilisk statue. Or you might want
to reflect that petrifying gaze up into the eyes of any lizard wrangler watching the action. Remember, do your homework-it may
save you from some nasty little surprises.
>>>>>(The Stoneman's right. It's always best to use a critter's
own powers against him if you can. Back when I was just a newbie, I joined a coupla runners on a little job against a gentech
lab outside of Renton. It was a research lab owned by a small
firm, so we weren't expecting much security. Anyway, we had
no sooner breached the perimeter fence of the place when
we heard some howling and saw a pack of hellhounds about
twenty yards away, coming at us at full speed. Vurn, the team
leader, ordered everyone to hold their fire and pulled what
looked like a little antique transistor radio out of his pocket. He
stood there calmly, turned a little dial on the thing and then,
just as I thought we were corpsemeat, the pack of black
hounds stopped in their tracks, started yelping and whining like
puppies and scattered, tails between their legs. After the run, I
asked Vurn how he did it. Turned out he had rigged up what he
called a "sonic blaster." Real simple-just a little thing that emitted a very loud, high-frequency tone. The tone was too high for
us-or the lab's security guards-to hear, but apparently the
hellhounds-with their improved hearing-found it excruciating.) <<<<<

MORE TRICKS OF THE TRADE
New weapons are being added to the modern magical arsenal all the time. Sometimes these weapons are produced in corporate magical-research projects. But just as often, it's street
magicians improvising to meet the demands of shadowrunning
that come up with new "tricks." Either way, it's next to impossible to keep up with all the latest mojo because it changes so
quickly. It's probably best not to worry too much about your lack
of knowledge-just remind yourself that you're bound to run into
new and unfamiliar drek. And hope you don't get cacked when
you do. That said, there are two important developments in the
magical arsenal you should be aware of: fiber-optic networks and
FAB-fat airborne bacteria.
Fiber-optic networks are an excellent example of a new magical application of an old technology. Fiber-optic cables have been
around since the twentieth century, when they were used to
transmit telecommunications data. In the late 2040s, magical
security engineers began to use them for magical-protection
applications. Now almost all magical security providers use fiberoptic networks. These networks of fiber-optic cables enable a
magician to "see" remote areas from up to 2.500 feet away-as
far as images can travel over the cable without using image-boosting equipment that would frag with the security wizboy's magic.
By using fiber optics to see, a magician can cast spells at those
areas in his view without directly exposing himself to his target.
>>>>>(Just because a magician isn't directly exposed to his target
doesn't mean he's not exposed to danger. What you do is find the
lens at the end of the cable. Then real quick like, place a laser
against it and fire straight into it. If you use an Ares MP laser it'll fry
any eye looking into the other end. If you don't have an MP
handy, you can use a laser sight. It won't do as much damage as
an Ares MP but it will blind the fragger for a few days at least. Either
way, it's a nasty little surprise.) <<<<<
-Trickster (02:34:21/01-25-57)
>>>>>(No need to be so destructive, Trickster. You want to louse
up a magician using fiber optics, do anything that'll block his view.
Hang hats over all the security cameras-or haul around a little
piece of frosted plexiglass and slip it over the lens. If the mageboy
can't see you, he can't do frag-all to hurt you.) <<<<<
-Mamacita (21:45:56/01-26-57)
>>>>>(Here's one for situations where the "hat trick" might not be
practical: invisibility. This is a beauty of a spell for fragging up the
security wizard who's watching things via fiber optics. The physical
invisibility spell will work on pieces of tech-no one'll be able to
see you over that fancy-shmancy cable system (unless you're real
clumsy and knock drek over). And sight's the only thing the fragger's got to pinpoint you. He's sitting 2,500 feet away in a little control room-he can't hear your footsteps or smell your breath or
bump into you. Move real quick and careful while you're under an
invisibility spell, and you can sleaze right past the security mage's
new toy.) <<<<<
-Mistik (11:23:21/01-30-57)
FAB, or fat airborne bacteria, is an example of new technology applied to magical use. FAB is genetically engineered bacteria
that can function as an astral containment device. In other words,
the drek forms an organic barrier that cannot be penetrated by
astral forms-the same principle behind so-called living walls of
ivy. It can be pumped into hollow walls or into hollow fibers that
can be fashioned into nets or meshes-these are called living
restraints. They're used to block or trap astrally active magicians
or spirits. The drek's prohibitively expensive, so you're likely to
encounter it only at the most heavily secured corp sites.
>>>>>(FAB sounds scary and it certainly is a scary feeling to be
trapped in a FAB net, but there are ways to defeat the drek. First
off. the bacteria smells nasty. I mean nasty-kinda like a cross
between rotten eggs, dwarf barf and warm ork drek. So if someone starts pumping it into the walls you're probably going to
notice. Next. FAB is airborne, so you can vacuum the drek right out
of the air. Finally, it burns real good.) <<<<<
-Valance (21:08:34/02-11-57)
If you want more information about fiber-optic networks and
FAB, I recommend you look up the Corporate Security
Handbook file elsewhere on this BBS. It contains a magical security section that talks about all the latest corporate magical security goodies.
>>>>>(Cybermancy
Okay, you've all had a chance to gander at the recent post
about what happened to Hatchetman. If you're smart, you actually read it. Here's a little refresher for those who remain ignorant
about the pile of nasty drek called cybermancy.
Some people say cybermancy is not healing magic, and
plenty of others say it doesn't exist. I know better, as does anyone
who's read Hatchetman's story. His tale made me curious-and
scared-so I went digging for more info. I found enough from reliable sources to say that this is some major, major mojo-heavyduty magic with bad consequences that you should be aware of.
Apparently, cybermantic rituals, in conjunction with
advanced cyber-surgical techniques, are used to defeat the
aural-physical threshold of a subject. In plain English, it lets you
keep some poor slot alive while you fill him up with enough cyberware to kill him. From what I gather, such people come out of the
procedure very powerful-and very fragged up as well. The cyberware makes them faster, stronger, deadlier than humanly possible.
Plus they become permanently active on the astral plane and less
susceptible to magic than normal metahumans. But they also
experience unpleasant physical side effects-I've read fragmentary reports of personality dissociation, cancer, drek like that.

Nobody seems real clear on exactly what bad drek happens or
why, but everything I could glean says that something goes badly
wrong with every subject they've put through this procedure.
Right now, it seems that only five or six clinics in the world are
equipped to perform cybermantic rituals, and they're all under
the control of some very powerful people. No names or exact
locations that I could find, but the rumors point to the usual suspects-Aztechnology, Saeder-Krupp, and Tír na nÓg for sure, and
Fuchi allegedly runs a couple. One of 'em's supposedly in NAN

(meta)humanity, cybermancy isn't widespread and probably
won't become so-like I said, this drek is heavy magic. Stands to
reason that the few magicians who know the rituals guard their
secrets very, very carefully and probably charge staggering fees
for their services. In fact, from what little I've heard over the rumor
mill, nobody knows for sure who the frag they are. The clinics
apparently can't do the whole cybermancy thing without these
mages, and there's only a few of them in the whole world. And no.
they're not giving lessons in how to work cybermantic magic.
(Think about it. You're one of, say, three or four people who can
do something that folks'll pay through the nose for. Are you going
to teach more people how to do it, and cut down the demand
for your personal services? Not likely.)
My advice to anyone in a position to do this to yourself is,
don't. My advice to anyone looking for it is, don't. It won't be
worth it. My advice to anyone who has to deal with a cybermantic opponent is, run. Fast. That way, you just might survive.) <<<<<

The fact that I grew up in a functional, nuclear family of modest means, went to a good
school and got enough moral support and loving discipline from my parents and teachers to
become a decent human being really took the edge off my dream
of becoming a hard-drinking, hard-loving, borderline-immoral
detective. My parents didn't like my plan to enroll in MIT to study
criminal justice, but they did have to admit I showed an aptitude.
My analytical mind, the ability to think on my feet and my interest
in physical fitness gave me the basic equipment I needed to solve
a few mysteries in my formative years (kidnapped pets, missing
items, large-scale embezzlement, corporate crime-you know the

When I started having "out-of-body experiences" every
night, then even during the day in the summer after I graduated
from high school, I was convinced I was going to die-either that,
or I was destined to found a new religion. I hated having no control over what I understood to be reality; it kept blurring in and
out, and I learned things about people that I really didn't want to
know. According to the feelings I picked up during my first "fit"
on the job, for example, my coworkers were a seething mass of
lust, hate, boredom, larceny and ambition-except for my boss,
who was actually as honest and trustworthy as she seemed. Of
course, if the rest of the company had their way, she wouldn't be
in charge for long.
I starting figuring out how to use this knack for "seeing another place" about the time it became generally accepted that something was different in the world, something that both the newsies
and the scientific community were labeling magic. Instead of being
afraid, my folks turned out to be just as curious about my magical
powers as I was. They put the word out to people they knew to
find me a teacher, and by the time I left for college in the fall I had
a pretty good handle on my existing powers. I also had an instructor lined up for continuing my magic education at school.
>>>>>(I thought the "My First Magical Experience" post was in
another area. Yaawwn.) <<<<<
-Sera-Sera (08:21:25/01-29-57)
I graduated college as one of a new breed, a magically skilled
investigator. I understood all the classic methods and techniques
of an inquiry agent, but magic gave me a unique perspective on
the tried-and-true traditions-and gave me an edge.
In the beginning and for a long time, my magic gave me an
advantage in my profession that no one could match or counter. I
took all sorts of jobs, from trailing spouses suspected of cheating
to courier jobs, from bodyguard work to tracing missing persons,
and eventually earned a well-deserved reputation for getting a job
done with a minimum of fuss and bloodshed. See, until the first
shopkeeper or homeowner or businessman decided to use magic
to protect his interests, those of us who might have been working
against those interests had free access to nearly everything that
person did and everywhere that person went. The secret was
astral perception and projection-sure, I used spells and magical
gear when they made sense, but there's nothing like simple perception and projection for gathering info.
Let me explain by spinning you the story of one of my early
cases.
I was living in Chicago at the time, working out of a small
office in a building poised on the leading edge of the everexpanding Loop-which meant I was in the area voted next most
likely to undergo the corporations' special brand of urban renewal. Like my role model, I'd hired myself a tough, good-looking
female secretary, only mine was an ork. Sasha was good for
morale-my morale, that is. Her presence carried a few important
messages to prospective clients, not to mention bill collectors.
She was big and well armed, and she moved quick on her feet,
which was a testament to the martial arts training she took-people didn't try to mess with her or me. The fact that she was female
and metahuman let clients know that I didn't have any race or
gender issues that would get in the way of my work. The fact that
I could afford a secretary at all spoke well of my success rate. Her
natural low-light vision came in handy a few times, too, especially against human muscle-boys (and girls, for that matter).
The client in question arrived a few days before Christmas in
2020. She was an elderly woman with a beautifully mannered
white dog on a heavy chain. Per standard operating procedure,
Sasha detained the client in the outer office for a moment or two
so that I could give her and her pet the astral once-over. For that
I used astral perception, a technique for looking into the astral
plane that lets a magician learn very specific things about the people, places and things in his environment by reading their auras.
First off, a person's aura reveals their general health, the condition
of their life force. Assensing (the professional term for reading
auras) also allows a magician to see a person's current emotional
state-and a good magician can do a lot with that information.
You read enough people, you learn the general signs that show
when people are lying, unhappy, homicidal, impatient-and
when people are faking an emotion or trying to hide what they
really feel behind an act. It's a handy tool of the trade.
>>>>>(It's possible for a mundane to fool a magician who's reading his aura, but extremely difficult. A really good "method" actor
might be able to get into his or her role deeply enough to fake the
desired aura-but at that point it could be argued that the person
really is experiencing the emotion, and so what the magician is
reading is, in fact, true.) <<<<<
-Killian (20:33:54/01-25-57)
Of course, I knew something was up as soon as they walked
in the door, because the watcher spirit I'd summoned for the occasion immediately began gibbering and shouting about the horrible, nasty-eyed, pointy-toothed meanie that was trying to eat
him. Well, I flipped to the astral and discovered that the old lady's faithful companion was a
hell hound! She didn't like me looking at her mistress, but apparently someone had
taught her the difference between an attack and a harmless look-see, so the hound
contented itself with baring it teeth. Oddly enough, the hell
hound's aura seemed more complicated than what you usually see for a dual-natured
animal. If the dog had been a (meta)human, I'd have said she was pining away for someone or something.
The old girl's aura showed
that she felt very distressed by the job she'd come to see me about, that she'd been carrying
a great sadness for many years-and that she was suffering the early stages of a nasty
cold. My client also seemed completely comfortable about the true nature of her pet.
I signaled Sasha to send them in. When she opened the
door to usher in my business appointment, Sasha announced, "Ms. Kroger and Gladys to
see you." And she winked.
Gladys the hell hound? As soon
as my client settled herself in a chair, I pushed my box of disposable hankies closer to her side of the desk.
"Good morning, Ms. Kroger. I'm sorry you feel so poorly.
Please help yourself to as many tissues as you need."
That took her off her guard. She opened her mouth, shut it
again, then said, "Thank you."
"How can I help you?" I asked. No matter how much info I
got from their aura, the standard opening gambit always worked
best to get them to spill the story. As she began her tale, I tipped
my chair back and stared at the ceiling. Quite frankly, most people who need to hire private investigators find it really difficult to
say why they've come, so they're usually more comfortable if I'm
not looking at them while they talk. I developed the habit of leaning back in my chair because it allows me to watch my potential
clients from the astral plane and judge the truthfulness of their
account, while at the same time hiding the fact that I'm splitting
my attention between two realities.
>>>>>(Man, this guy covers all the bases-he's got the magic act

perceiving. First off, he'll look
like he's zonin' when he's peeking into the astral-eyes kind of
unfocused, hard to get his
attention. Second, he'll react to
things no one else can see.
Third, he'll probably be pretty
clumsy doing the really simple
stuff; walking, writing, eating
and all the other things you
learn
as
a youngster.
Remember: you don't have to
be a magician to recognize
one.) <<<<<

So Ms. Kroger told me her
problem, with Gladys sitting
alertly at her side. Seems that
when Ms. Kroger found Gladys
as a pup, she'd had the chance
to keep the rest of the litter,
too, another female and two
males. For what she later considered very selfish reasons,
she decided to find other
homes for all the pups but
Gladys. Later she felt that
Gladys missed her littermates
and she wanted to cheer her up
by planning a reunion.

doesn't laugh in her face, he applies all the skills at his disposal,
accomplishes the job, and has no trouble handling a little something extra along the way, proving that a true professional gets the
job done, no matter what the job.) <<<<<
-Hey Markit (15:11:06/01-25-57)
The problem was, she wasn't having any luck tracking down
the other three hounds. The people who'd taken them originally
had sold them to other parties, and the trail simply petered out
after that first sale. If I hadn't been watching Ms. Kroger from
astral space, I might have missed the fear she felt as she described
her efforts so far. Despite my inclination to laugh off this case, I felt
an unexpected obligation to Gladys. Her fiery red eyes seemed to
plead with me, but she seemed more worried about Ms. Kroger
than her brothers and sister.
As I dropped my chair back to its usual position, I dropped
out of astral space. "Ms. Kroger, I'll take the job," I said, "but
you're going to have to tell me the whole story. You're scared,
and I can't do my job right if I don't know why."
I have to give the old girl credit. She didn't break down, just
pressed her lips together, sighed, then began again. "I really do
want to find Gladys's littermates," she said. "But not just to make
my dog happy. I have a friend who is a shaman, and he has told me
some very strange things about my companion. For one thing, my
friend explained to me that Gladys is what is called a hell houndan awful name, if you ask me." She rubbed her pet between its ears.
"Why anyone would believe such a sweet animal came from hell is
beyond me. Anyway, Stanley-that's my shaman friend-says that
Gladys shows the potential to 'manifest'-is that the right word ?some unusual magical powers because she is a crossbreed. Stanley
can give you the details, but what I'm concerned about is that
someone else has discovered this potential in the other dogs from
the litter. I'm afraid Gladys's brothers and sister will be mistreated.
"Now, Stanley has warned me that Gladys may be the only one
of her litter to be so good-tempered and affectionate, and so I don't
really expect to keep all the dogs when we find them. I just want to
make sure they're happy. What frightens me about looking for the
other dogs is that the people I gave the puppies to are all dead."
>>>>>(Crazy old broad. If her hound actually had unusual powers,
or even an unusual combination of powers, it should have been

Elise (02:50:43/01-26-57)
So I asked Ms. Kroger to supply me with all the info she hadnames and last known addresses for the dogs' original owners, anything she knew about the owners' deaths, Stanley's full name and
address, descriptions of the hell hounds-the usual stuff. I started
working as soon as she left. Well, first I had lunch, then I got started. I made myself an appointment with Stanley Silent Dog for later
in the day, then briefed Sasha on what I needed her to do. Did I
mention Sasha was a decker? While she jacked in and followed up
the leads we had, I turtled along on my own keyboard and terminal, doing a little research into the current knowledge on hell
hounds and genetic manipulation of magical creatures.
Even 30 years ago, people were using hell hounds for security. I've found that people will use most any doglike animal for
protection-the fact that hell hounds offer enhanced senses and
the potential for flame projection and immunity to fire only
increases their usefulness as guard animals. It's their dual nature
that makes them particularly valuable, however. See, a dualnatured critter is always present on both the astral and physical
planes. An intruder trying to sneak through a gate would face the
hell hound's physical attack. An astrally projecting magician trying
to move through that same gate would face the hell hound's
astral presence-and the hound is equally dangerous and equally
efficient on both planes. Unlike (meta)humans, who have to learn
how to function on the astral plane while keeping their body alive
on the physical, dual-natured beings suffer no disadvantages from
being present on two planes simultaneously.
>>>>>(For those of you who don't know, a magician who astrally projects essentially separates his "spirit," his consciousness, from his body.
Though leaving his body completely vulnerable, the magician can
move anywhere at amazing speeds, interact with other astral beings,
and even manifest on the physical plane. This ability offers a great
many practical uses: infiltrating all sorts of buildings and areas, performing reconnaissance for a shadowrunner team, discovering the
type of astral security protecting a target, providing astral security for
a team or person, sending a message, performing specialized magical attacks, and so on. Depending on your circumstances, though,
the big disadvantage of leaving your body completely vulnerable
might outweigh the benefits of astral projection.) <<<<<

still run the risk of another magic-type person grounding something
nasty into the physical plane next to your body.) <<<<<

of skin replaced because of a magician. My best chummer,
Bernie, asked me to watch his body while he went on an astral
jaunt. Now, I trust Bernie with my life (and did, as a matter of
fact), but he felt the need to reassure me that nothing bad
would come from astral space while he was gone. He went so
far as to take me to a neutral third party, a very reputable
mage, to prove that he was carrying no active magical
devices. For his own peace of mind, Bernie also had the mage
scan me for magical doohickeys. Good thing, too, 'cause she
found one. Seems the heirloom ring my mother had given me
was actually a focus for an armor spell lock-I guess there are
more skeletons in my closet than meet the eye. Anyway, I did
this favor for Bernie. Seemed like gravy-just had to keep an
eye out for baddies and take care of any who showed up.
About an hour into the watch, a small red doglike creature
appeared out of nowhere, and before I could move, exploded
in a huge fireball. Lucky for me, this mysterious flame wasn't
centered directly over Bernie, or he could've cacked it. Can
someone explain that bit of weirdness?) <<<<<
-Thelma (09:41:37/01-24-57)
>>>>>(You were the recipient of another type of grounded spell.
The magician who toasted you abused his power, as far as I'm
concerned. Here's the straight drek. Whether for this purpose or
some other, the magician summoned a weak fire-elemental spirit
before visiting astral space. When he made his attack, he sent the
elemental to Bernie's body, commanded it to manifest (which
created the necessary astral-physical connection) and blew it up
with a physical spell, in this case a fireball. Unless your friend Bernie
is a being of ultimate evil that the attacking mage felt compelled
to destroy, he's really hurting himself as far as ever summoning
other elementals. If he's powerful enough and performs the correct rituals, he will continue to be able to summon these spirits. But
as a collective being, they've got a looong memory, and every
one he summons will fight to win its freedom. If he ever loses control of an elemental, he can kiss his butt good-by.) <<<<<

warding his buddy?) <<<<<
-Cracker (15:20:04/01-24-57)
>>>>>(Only if he established an attuned ward. Basically, the point
of a ward is that no astral being can pass through it-including the
caster. An attuned ward lives up to its name; the magician casting it tunes the ward to his own astral "signature" so that he
becomes "invisible" to the astral barrier, and so can move freely
into and out of the warded area. This would have kept your friendly little fire elemental away.) <<<<<
-Aron (15:24:51/01-24-57)
>>>>>(Hmmm. It's like our detective friend said (was it him?): for
every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Or wait,
maybe it was Newton. What I'm trying to say here is that for every
barrier and ward spell that another magician puts up, there's
ways around them. Now, I can use magic, no question-I'm killer
in astral space. On the physical plane, though, I got squat. So I use
my one power to my advantage and spend a lot of time in astral
space. I figure out a lot of cool stuff that way.
Take this ward thing, for example. I was taking a perfectly
innocent stroll through astral space (okay, maybe not perfectly
innocent) last week and swooped past one of my favorite astral
haunts, a privately owned and operated grade school. There're
two or three magically capable kids there who astrally perceive
during nap time, and they're just the cutest sprites-very friendly
and bright, really makes my day a whole lot more cheerful when
I see them. Only problem was, last week I couldn't see them
because someone had slapped up a ward! I was disappointed
and mad, and I decided I just wasn't going to take it. So I started
poking around. Whoever put up the ward used a fair amount of
force, and I knew I couldn't just break through. And I didn't really
want to attract a whole lot of attention to myself by firing off a
spell powerful enough to defeat the barrier, so I decided to try a
few other things at random, hoping that one of them would work.
What I ended up with is a little something I now call phasing. As an
initiate, I can attempt to dispel spells, and that was one of the
tricks I tried on the ward around the grade school. Much to my surprise, I found that my successful dispel attempt let me slip through
the astral barrier with no one the wiser.
The effort was worth it, 'cause what I found inside was even
more surprising. The magical kids had spontaneously pooled their
gifts to form the barrier themselves. From what I gathered, they'd
seen another magician sniffing around their turf and they didn't
like his looks, so they'd blocked him by creating a wall around their
classroom. I didn't bother trying to explain that what they'd done
was impossible without the proper materials and training, I just let
'em get on with taking their naps-hey, that kind of thing takes a
lot out of you! Guess I oughta put some thought into finding them
good teachers .) <<<<<

The version of current research offered for public consumption
wasn't too useful, so I figured I'd get Sasha to do a little poking
around in the corporate data bases. Aztechnology was always a
good bet for this kind of stuff, but I doubted we'd get far looking
into their affairs. Yamatetsu, however, showed a promising distribution of assets- high interest in biotechnology and a lot of nuyen
going into magical research (though that category didn't show up
on the corporate profile). Plus, Yamatetsu had a rep of relying heavily on the use of paranormal biologicals, mainly hell hounds, for site
security. This much I knew from previous dealings with them.
I checked in with Sasha before leaving to meet Stanley Silent
Dog. Through the legitimate Matrix channels, she'd established
that the three other owners had each sold their hound to an interested third party within a year of accepting the pet from Ms.
Kroger. I knew she'd find a connection between the buyers if one
existed. The official documents filed on the three owners' deaths
ruled their demises as death by misadventure, a quaint way of
saying they died in some sort of accident. Sasha had also accessed
the police records on the deaths, and even there found no hints
that the officers in charge of the investigations suspected foul
play. The only odd circumstance was that all three died in the
same precinct of Chicago, even though they lived in three different parts of the country. Sasha figured she could probably find an
explanation for that, too. She came up empty, though, on tracing
the dogs through their licenses, registrations or veterinary
records. That one would probably require me beating the streets.
I left Sasha to her work and headed to Portage Park for my
meeting. (As with many Chicago neighborhoods, the area south and
east of Harlem Avenue and Irving Park Road had retained its village
name long after its residents began paying taxes to the city.) Ms.
Kroger's friend lived in a small house overshadowed by the everexpanding Harlem-Irving Plaza. Beginning life as a small, open-air
mall, the HIP was enclosed in the mid- to late- 1900s and continued
to grow, eventually absorbing five square miles of retail real estate
and expanding upward simultaneously. I'd always avoided the HIP;
that whole area gave me the creeps, and I could actually pinpoint
the reason why. Part of the area's long been owned by a facility for
the mentally challenged, and we all know that the field of mental
health has gone through many, many changes over the yearsmostly moving from barbaric to highly regulated and medically
sound. There's a mass grave in the area, dug in the aftermath of the
Chicago fire, which was also used to bury victims of the various diseases that ran rampant after the disaster. And, quite frankly, by 2020
the area's residents had had a lot of years to hate their neighbors.
Maybe I was just being oversensitive, but the background count in
Portage Park made me nauseous. I didn't understand how a shaman
could live here, but I was going to have the opportunity to ask.
Stanley Silent Dog made his home in an ivy-covered cottage,
surrounded by a small. well-tended lawn, enclosed by a thick
hedge. The walk leading to his door was made of river stones, as
was the path to a small wooden shed on one corner of the property. While a mundane artist would see the house as a thing of
beauty, and a building contractor would calculate the profit to be
made repairing the brick from the damage the ivy was doing, I
recognized it as a magic user's way of protecting himself and his
guests from unwanted astral interference. His house constituted
the equivalent of a living wall, a magical barrier based on the fact
that astral beings cannot move through living matter. Even the
foundation of the house was faced with medium-sized river
stones, too small for a (meta)human astral being to move through.

reminded me of a philosophy my father held regarding automobiles; the more complex the system, the more that can go wrong.
Seems to me that the more elaborate the magical security measures, the more likely it is that some element will be overlooked, or
that procedures expected to mesh into a seamless whole will
actually offer holes.) <<<<<

to look like they're just as important as the big guys, so they splash
out a wad of cash, then figure out that they bought more than
they needed. They start cuttin' corners-layin' off those pricey
mages, usin' fewer guards, deferrin' equipment maintenance,
buyin' low-grade ritual materials-next thing you know, there're
holes in their security big enough to drive a panzer through.
Look. All I'm sayin' is that you gotta do your research. Just
'cause it says, "Security Provided by Knight Errant" on the glass
doors don't mean that Northern Light Plastics has the same traps,
alarms, and troops as Renraku.) <<<<<
-Droogie (14:15:46/01-27-57)
>>>>>(Good advice, doing your research. Research is how we
beat the corps, and how the corps try to keep one step ahead of
the runners. Take this fat bacteria thing, for example. The first few
magicians who ran into it had a very bad experience because it
was an unknown quantity-they'd never seen it before and had
no idea how to handle it. The rest of us can learn from their
"research," however unwilling that research may have been. First
of all, we now know to look for it. The presence of fat bacteria
means the corp has mages onsite, but it also means that mundanes can capture us, or at least spot us using the UV version. So.
we can prepare to defend ourselves. If legwork on a target indicates the potential for fat bacteria security measures, mages can
prepare for that problem going in. For example, if your legwork
can pinpoint the area in which the corp is using fat bacteria, you
could insert a physical team or drone to simply cut through the
wall or otherwise destroy the bacteria to let the astral presence
through. That strategy also works well as a rescue plan.
Using the same basic principle, if you bind an elemental to
your service before entering the target site, then find yourself
caught in fat bacteria, you can summon the spirit to you, command it to manifest, and instruct it to physically break out of the
contaminated area.) <<<<<
-Magister (20:42:15/01-27-57)
>>>>>(Doncha just hate it when a mage uses "simply" in the same
sentence as "physical insertion"? I know I do. The wizard's got a
good angle on this, though. It's why shadowrunners work in teams,
to cover each others' weaknesses-and butts.) <<<<<
-Rogers (13:39:33/01-29-57)
As a rule, magic users don't assense each other or even
assense things belonging to another magic user without permission-it's a privacy-courtesy issue. So I kept myself to myself,
walked up to Stanley's door and knocked. I was right on time for
our meeting, so I was surprised when no one answered. When I
knocked a second time and still got no response, I tried the door.
Locked. Now, Stanley had made a point of asking me to be
prompt, because he was fitting me in between a magic lesson and
a ritual casting. I had offered to come in the evening, but he had
his violin lesson on Tuesdays (I got the impression he used music
for his centering technique). Anyway, I immediately suspected
foul play-I get generally more suspicious of human nature and
the nature of coincidence when I'm on a case. Casually, I strolled
around to the back of the house.
The back door was also locked, so I took my skeleton card
from my wallet and slotted it into the maglock. Why didn't I just
assense the place at that point, you ask, or use some kind of spell
to find out what was going on? Good question. Here's the situation as I saw it: I was investigating a case in which three apparently unrelated people were dead. I had an appointment with a
clock-watcher, and he wasn't answering his door at the agreedupon time. I had vague suspicions of corporate involvement. So I
figured my man Stan was in trouble. Now, I didn't see any signs
of physical surveillance, so I had to assume they'd set some type
of astral watch. That was Reason 1 to not go astral. Reason 2 to
keep to the mundane methods was that any kind of magic use
sends up an astral flare in the etheric plane-and again, I was
working under the assumption that they (whoever they were) had
someone watching. My rule of thumb, then as now, is to use mundane solutions whenever possible.
>>>>>(I get real rakked off at the mundanes who think magic is
the answer to everything. "Can't you just, well, you know?" they
say and wave their hands-like I'm gonna snap my fingers and
make their nuyen for them. Sheesh.) <<<<<

-Whisper (03:54:15/01-27-57)
>>>>>(Using magic also leaves a short-term impression in the astral
plane, traces that might allow another magician to learn something about the caster. In fact, I know skilled assensers who can

-Royale (19:18:22/01-27-57)
My modern-day skeleton key signaled that it had found the
lock's sequence, so I tucked the key back into my wallet and opened
the door. As I stepped into the house, a sort of ambient electricity
lifted the hair on my arms and neck-the same reaction I have every
time I enter a magic-heavy environment. I listened carefully for a
moment, sniffed the air-nothing. I used standard investigative
operating procedure for one-agent penetration of a small residence,
and found nothing-except for Stanley, tied up in the bathtub. When
I took the professionally tied gag out of his mouth, Stan worked his
jaw for a second, said, "Thanks," and, "Can you let my dog out of the
toilet?" I lifted the lid and sure enough, there was a very wet, very
unhappy dachshund bound and muzzled. I introduced myself while
I untied them both, then Stan told me what happened.
"Fortunately, the student scheduled for my one o'clock lesson
canceled, otherwise she'd have been here when the goons arrived.
They were pretty polite for a team of corporate strong-arms, I have
to admit-they asked me politely for what they wanted, took it anyway when I refused, then left me as you discovered. Spot tried to
help me out, so they took care of him, too." By this time, we'd
arrived in what anyone else would have used as the living room.
Obviously a combination study-schoolroom-reception area, it
looked like an interior decorator with a completely alien sense of
design had done some work here. The goons had been thorough,
but they were neat. Rather than dumping the contents of drawers
and cabinets on the floor, they'd methodically emptied every storage area and stacked the contents on every other available surface.
Instead of ripping up the upholstery, they disassembled all the furniture, stacking the pieces, the upholstery and the cushions in neat
piles. I looked at Stanley and he looked at me. "There were five of
them, and they worked fast," he commented.
"What did they take?"
"Everything I had on paranormal animals, bioengineering, and
research into the relationship between magic and genetics. I've been
working on a theory for five years now on how animals incorporate
magic into their genetic makeup, and I believe I'm finally making
some progress. For example, Spot here has shown no magical capabilities, but all three of his littermates show a single paranormal ability-one possesses the power of fear, one has the power of search,
and the third displays enhanced movement." My mind boggled for
a second as I tried to imagine paranormal dachshunds. "Here's the
interesting part. When all four dogs are in proximity to each other,
they manifest the power of paralyzing touch. I've conducted exhaustive research on hundreds of four-pup litters, and a statistically significant number of litters exhibit this same phenomenon. Rose's hell
hound-that is, Ms. Kroger's Gladys-seems to have the significant
gene that acts as a catalyst for this power enhancement, but I can
only test my theory by finding her littermates."
I was grilling Stan about the details of the goons, looking for
clues to their corporate association, when a small orange femaletype person suddenly appeared in the air between us. "Yowsa,
babe," it purred. "You'all got some action happenin' on the way
outside o'your home turf. Looks to me like one o'those big bad corporator dudes you'all warned me about. He's sniffin' around my
perimeter, so I thought I'd let you take care of it for me. Okay, big
boy?" As I flipped into the etheric plane, I thought about the theory that watcher spirits are nothing more than a tiny fraction of the
summoner's consciousness imprinted on astral space and wondered about Mr. Stanley Silent Dog. The little short-term spirit did
its job right, I had to give it that. The shaman and I saw each other's
astral presence at the same time, and immediately began looking
for the intruder. She was headed straight for the house, and looked
none too happy to see two opponents, rather than one. We forced
her into a fighting retreat and followed her back to her meat body.
None too smart a move, in retrospect-two magicians leaving their
bodies unprotected except for a mundane dachshund-but, at the
time, we were both more focused on discovering the identity and
affiliation of the interested party. Our rash pursuit yielded results,
though, giving us the thread we needed to unravel the mystery.
>>>>>(You know, you lose a little bit of yourself for every hour you
spend in astral space, and you can die because of it. Right now,
you're saying, "Uh-huh. And ... . " but it's a serious issue. Life
involves a lot of risks, but magicians take a big risk every time they
enter astral space. It's not just that your astral presence could get
you killed, or that you might get trapped in astral space, or that
your meat body could be destroyed-all those are bad enough.
There's something else magicians don't like to talk about, or even
admit. The fact is, travel on the etheric plane can be as addictive
as travel in the Matrix. People sometimes just forget to return to
their meat, or cut it too close and die.) <<<<<
-Royale (09:28:10/01-28-57)
As is so often the case, the whole affair wound up pretty
quickly once I found the key fact. Sasha's Matrix work revealed
that it was, in fact, simply a coincidence that the owners of the
other three hell hounds from Gladys's litter died in Chicago, and
that the same breeding firm bought all three hounds. Not that I'm
a great believer in coincidence, especially when I'm on a case, but
I was only being paid to investigate the whereabouts of the
hounds. Gladys's littermates were living fat and happy in New
York, breeding true to type and powers. We discovered that the
goons and the magician sent to appropriate Stanley's work
belonged to Yakashima Technologies, an up-and-comer in the
biotech field. The Japanese-based corp had a lot of moxie and a
brilliant staff, but its current CEO operated under some very oldfashioned business concepts, mainly, you don't have to take no
for an answer, but you don't have to be rude about it.
>>>>>(Doesn't sound to me like old Nathan here is very thorough
in his work. How could he leave that huge loose end just floppin'
around out there? The "coincidence" of all three people dying in
one place just screams follow-up to me.) <<<<<
-Sera-Sera (12:18:21/01-24-57)
>>>>>(And I suppose you stop in the middle of a run to clean up
every little mess you see? When was the last time you busted an
embezzler while you were looking for that valuable paydata Mr.

-Whisper (23:42:15/01-27-57)
>>>>>(Touché.) <<<<<
-Sera-Sera (08:16:43/01-28-57)
A cautious person, Stanley had kept his research as secret as
he could manage, naturally assuming that any corporation interested would have nefarious purposes in mind. When Yakashima
turned out to be the least of several evils, Stan grudgingly agreed
to explain the research they'd stolen and suggest ways for it to be
put to a positive use. Yakashima put him on retainer for an
obscene amount of nuyen and gave him free rein to continue his
research, and we kept in touch pretty regularly. He let me know
that his tests with Gladys and her littermates were just as successful as he'd hoped, but he never talked about his work much
after that. From the first, I'd thought he was a bit off the beam, and
I often wondered if he'd simply been bought off-encouraged to
pursue his line of inquiry but forced to keep his results under
wraps while the corp lifted the methodologies and discoveries
that supported their own efforts. Though he was a nice enough
guy, I didn't consider his research methods to be all that reliable.
In fact, in all the years since this case, I've never seen nor heard
any other magician or scientist propose even a similar theory
regarding paranormal animals.
Anyway, Ms. Kroger had her hell hound reunion, and I collected my fee, plus expenses.
>>>>>(Sounds like a complete crackpot, if you ask me. Everybody
knows that's not how magic works. I mean, if four magical dogs
getting together allows them to manifest an additional power, why
doesn't it work that way for sentient magicians? And I also find it
pretty hard to believe that Stanley found a statistically significant
number of related animals that all manifested different powers and
also displayed the phenomenon he was studying. I think he must
have been fudging the results to meet his expectations, or maybe
there was some quirk in his own magic that acted as the catalyst
he described-but even that's pretty unlikely. I mean, even magic
has to follow some laws.) <<<<<
-Gabriel (22:31:14/01-25-57)
>>>>>(I think it's still a little too soon to be making such bald, positive statements about the way magic works. Things change all the

new powers threaten the balance of the world, inexplicable,
unexpected, alien and terrifying creatures and objects turn our
world views upside-down: They say, "expect the unexpected." I
believe that's the only way we're all going to survive.) <<<<<

so if something seems impossible to us it's probably just that we're
not looking in the right place at the right time and when it's time
for us to understand where the path leads Dog will show us where
to go. So don't be so impatient and doubtful because it will all
work out in the end you'll see it will for all of us Dog shamans and

Soon after that case, companies offering magical protection

harder. Fortunately for me, everyone working to keep their person
and possessions safe from people like me had to try just as hard.

ADEPTS
>>>>>(Despite what some people may think, magic doesn't just belong to spellslingers and
conjurers of nature spirits. It also belongs to adepts, who use it in ways that are sometimes the
same and sometimes a lot different. They're everywhere in the streets and the shadows, and
my chummer Johnny Zen'll tell you all about them.) <<<<<
-Talon (10:22:31/01-10-57)
>>>>>(As far as we know, there are basically two kinds of adepts: physical adepts and magical adepts. And before anybody asks, yes, physical adepts use magic. The name "magical
adepts" refers to the fact that these non-physical adepts specialize in certain areas of magical
expertise; I've personally met shamanic adepts, elemental adepts, enchanting adepts, conjuring adepts, and sorcery adepts. There may be any number of other types out there that we
just haven't run across yet, so don't take this list as the be-all and end-all of this subject.) <<<<<
-Magister (23:14:55/01-29-57)
I'm a follower of the Inner Magic. Most of you know me and those like me as adepts, and
you think you know all about our skills and powers. Trust me-you don't. But you just might
have a glimmer or two of real understanding after you read this file. Get to know us, chumley,
we're useful.
The eggheads define adepts as individuals who use their magical talents to boost their
meatbodies and exhibit specific magical abilities. Of course, that definition don't really tell you
much, now does it? Astral awareness, the ability to shrug off serious physical injury-that
"specific magical abilities" tag can include any number of wiz little tricks, cuz no two adepts
display exactly the same abilities.
>>>>>(A bit of an oversimplification, I think. While adepts have displayed almost endless combinations of "wiz little tricks," magical theorists have actually defined and studied no more than
a dozen or so basic adept abilities.) <<<<<
-Silicon Mage (07:55:54/02-01-57)
>>>>>(Your magical theorists are identifying new adept powers all
of the time, though. Some of those abilities appear naturally, but
many can only be developed through training. Rumor has it that
some adept powers can be learned only from certain magical
groups, which guard their secrets jealously.) <<<<<
-Kudo (13:42:40/02-07-57)
So what's the difference between an adept and a mage or
shaman? The usual explanation is that we adepts are "less powerful." Me, I'd say that depends on how you define powerful. Can
we sling spells? Some adepts can. Can we see the astral? Most of
us can-the exceptions are the guys who only conjure spirits or
only sling spells. Can we go astral? Some can. Sure, adepts have
certain limits that "full-power" mageboys and medicine men
don't, but those same limits give us that much more focus on the
wiz stuff we can do. And that, chummerinos, makes us every bit
as good at using our mojo-if not better-than any "full" magician.
>>>>>(I beg to differ, JZ. Sure, adepts are good at using their
magic-but all this drek about "better" is irrelevant. On the streets,
all you really need to be is good enough to get the job
done.) <<<<<
-Tim (11:23:44/01-28-57)
DISCOVERY
Adepts can discover they got the Power in all kinds of waysjust like magicians. Sometimes a magician will recognize a latent
adept by the kid's aura and offer to train him. That's how it works
in the Native American Nations. The tribal shaman spots the
young adept, then the kid apprentices with a teacher who helps
him make the most of his talent. In the UCAS, CAS and California
Free State, the powers that be use magical testing in the schools
to identify young adepts they can train and exploit. (Not much diff
between us and the wizboys so far, is there?)
Other adepts get no such help. They discover their talent
when some particularly nasty drek happens in their lives. The old
subconscious develops the abilities, and presto change-o! One day
you realize you're not like the other kids. Drek, I know some people who used the Power for years without ever really knowing it.
>>>>>(It's not all that surprising, actually. Many adepts have abilities that make them extraordinary individuals, but not superhuman-so it's easy for someone unaware of magic to ascribe their
achievements to talent, luck, drive, the blessing of the spirits or
whatever.) <<<<<

In my own case, I was just a kid running with a local gang
when another adept recognized my potential and decided to take
me in and train me. Drek, I though it was a real laugh at the time.
This skinny old man tells me that he's gonna teach me how to be
a warrior, that he's gonna be my master? I stopped laughing after
he kicked my hoop all around the street and back.

parts of the target covered by armor, anyway.) <<<<<
-Hangfire (00: 26:04/02-10-57)
TRAINING
Any wizworm'll tell you that formal training is a tricky issue.
That's cuz most magical learning is a matter of intuition and
insight-it's not the kinda drek you can learn from a book. Every
magician learns to wield the Power in his own way. A teacher can
take you up to a certain point, but after that ya gotta flap your own
wings. You either get it or you don't.
That's why adepts who are unaware of their abilities sometimes learn faster than others. They're not thinking about what
they're doing, so their own minds don't get in the way. Their abilities develop naturally, according to their needs. Of course, they
also can't choose how they want their development to go. The
process is out of their hands.
>>>>>(If you know yourself, fine. But if your subconscious is harboring any secrets, watch out. You could end up spontaneously manIfesting abilities based on subconscious goals and desires from the
dark, repressed side of yourself that you wouldn't want manifested in the physical world.) <<<<<
-Nacht (02:31:22/01-22-57)
Formally trained adepts, on the other hand, have more control over the abilities they develop. But they also gotta overcome
their conscious learning. When I first began training with my sensei, there were a coupla times he didn't seem to be teaching me
a fragging thing. He made me do all kinds of pointless exercises
and meditations, nothing that seemed like the amazing things
he'd shown me when we'd first met. I kept waiting and waiting
for something to happen, but nothing did, it was just more of the
same drek. One night I finally just lost it. But the old man guided
my anger as skillfully as he handled my physical attacks. I ranted
about his inane requirements, and he countered by asking me
what I wanted from him. In that moment my anger turned inward
and crystallized, a moment of complete centered-ness and attention came over me, and my sensei looked at me. "Now that you
have found your center," he said, "you can begin learning to be a
warrior."
FINDING THE WAY
Just as a magician focuses and develops his magical abilities
by following his tradition, an adept follows his Way.
>>>>>(Wait a minute. I've never even heard of this "Way" thing.
What's he talking about?) <<<<<
-Connor (07:24:53/01-13-57)
>>>>>(Johnny's talking his own philosophy here. Other adepts
describe the same thing that Johnny calls his "Way" in their own
words, but with pretty much the same idea behind it. The adept
does not follow any kind of formalized tradition or any kind of rules.
Each adept manifests his abilities according to his own inner
self.) <<<<<
-Hangfire (01:18:20/01-20-57)
The Way is at the heart of an adept's power, the whole source
of his magic. It's the guide that shapes his abilities and his inmost
self. Lots of the Ways followed by adepts come from heroic myths
and legends-the serious dudes, the real Big Guns that an adept
can choose to follow and model himself after.
A talented person who grows into an adept always begins
with the Way. For people like me who are formally trained by
teachers, the Way is something we learn to choose or discover
within ourselves. Then we consciously follow our Way and cultivate our abilities. The Way my sensei showed me allowed me to
develop my body, sharpen my vision and become one with my
targets so that I overcame the gap between the actor and the
acted-upon. In time, I learned to expand my Way into archery-I
figured out how to connect archer, arrow and target into one
smoothly flowing whole.
For adepts who develop their wiz tricks spontaneously, the
Way isn't quite so deliberate-but it's just as important. For some,
the Way means shooting for some kind of physical perfection.
Athletes, dancers, martial artists, soldiers-these folks are following Ways that bring out their latent abilities. For the ones who
develop their Power in a crisis, the Way comes on them instantly,
in the moment of calm where the mind is clear and fear washes
away all doubts.
Once a potential adept finds his Way, he develops his magical abilities based on it. An athlete adept pushes to develop
greater strength, stamina, speed and skill at his sport. A dancer
might become more and more graceful and agile.
>>>>>(Not all physical adepts are hoop-kicking street fighters. The
star of the Bolshoi Ballet, Elena Chantova, is a physical adept
whose grace on stage is like nothing you have ever seen.) <<<<<
-Slider (20:12:43/01-20-57)
As the adept learns, his understanding of his Way deepens and
he gets even better at using his mojo. An adept who pursues the
Way throughout his life can do some incredible drek. My own sensei followed his Way for decades before taking me as a student, and
I have yet to equal him.
>>>>>(JZ has got that right. An adept who keeps working and
practicing just keeps improving. It's like watching evolution in fastforward to see someone you know change and improve so much
over the course of a few years.) <<<<<

>>>>>(Some physads, of course, improve faster than others. As in
all things, your mileage may vary.) <<<<<
-Silicon Mage (21:30:19/01-25-57)
Most important, the Way gives each adept a role to play in
the world. Of course, there are more possible Ways to follow than
I can cram into one little post, but I'll describe the most common
just to give you an idea.
WAY OF THE WARRIOR
I follow the Way of the Warrior, the Spiller of Blood, the
Destroyer. Warrior adepts include martial arts masters, swordsmen, Zen archers, and firearms experts.

-Josie Cruise (20:14:53/02-06-57)
Warrior adepts are aggressive puppies by nature, which lets
us focus our talents into increased combat prowess. Not all warrior adepts are bloodthirsty maniacs, of course, but we tend to
have a certain common focus on martial development that shapes
us in similar ways.

combat abilities may be incorrectly classified as "warriors"-they
might fit into one of the other classifications better.) <<<<<

fighting on the astral, you don't need to leave your body to do
that. If I can see it, I can nail it, unless it's behind a physical wall in
the "real" world or something. It's easy to get around that limit-I
just have to pick my ground before getting into an astral slugfest.
Astral projection as a combat tactic is bad news, anyway. Your
empty body is a sitting-duck target for anything or anyone, unless
you've got the time to set up protection for it in advance. What're

WAY OF THE ATHLETE
Athlete adepts develop their abilities through sports and
dancing. These adepts tend to be fanatically devoted to their chosen field, driven to succeed just like the champion athletes of the
past. Their devotion, though, feeds and is backed up by their
inherent magical talents.
Athlete adepts are in a tough position nowadays. Their ability at their chosen sport is almost always the primary focus of their
lives, and yet modern prejudice about magical enhancements
prevent an awful lot of adepts from truly excelling in athletics.
Some sports that allow extensive cybernetic mods, such as football, also allow physad players. Even then, though, adepts often
get nasty or just plain indifferent treatment from managers,
coaches and even fans. Lots of ignorant yobbos see the abilities of
physical adepts as magical "cheating" that allows the adept to
perform better than they "should" be able to. These nice folks
think of the Power as some kind of "outside" boost to the athlete's
abilities, just like cyber enhancements or drugs, and they don't
want it mucking up their precious Urban Brawl games.
>>>>>(A lot of adept athletes spend time warming the bench
when their team plays in some place where the marketing demographics show that people prefer good ol' fashioned cyberware
to magic. Then they're trotted out like trained dogs for the crowds
that think being an adept is chill or trendy.) <<<<<
-HawksFan (15:03:33/01-25-57)
>>>>>(The debate over barring adepts from the Olympic games
was a long and bloody one, but in the end nobody was really
paying much attention. The Olympics are considered second-rate
entertainment compared to what's on the trid, and the
International Olympic Committee's purist attitudes toward cyberware. magic and metahumans has made it difficult for the games
to find a network that wants to carry them these days.) <<<<<
-MVP (21:46:20/01-28-57)
>>>>>(Athlete adepts have presented a problem for years.
They're tough to detect unless you want to run every athlete past
a magician or astral adept-and how many leagues can afford
that? It's also very difficult to separate an adept's natural ability
from his magically powered ability. A very good aura reader who
studies the adept in action can get a good idea of when the
magic comes into play, but that takes hours of study per adept!
Add on top of that the fact that many athletes can be physical
adepts and not even be aware of it and you've got a legislative
nightmare on your hands.) <<<<<
-Legal Eagle (14:10:20/01-29-57)
WAY OF THE ARTIST
Some adepts use their abilities to create art, usually something tangible like sculpture because our magic is so strongly tied
to our physical selves. Of course, not all artist adepts use the
Power in the same way. I know one guy who weaves his own
blankets and ponchos and drek, putting his Power into every
thread. Another chum of mine writes novels and poems. Both of
these people use their magical knack for seeing the world as it
truly Is: then they bring that vision into being through their art.
Either way, it's tied to the physical. They focus their mojo through
the physical act of creating art (weaving, word processing, whatever) and produce a physical object (a statue, a painting, a book).
Artist adepts have one big advantage over the rest of us-they
can center themselves on their Way in nothing flat, because
they're right smack dab in the middle of their own magical minds
the minute they start practicing the art they love. (And it's pretty
awesome drek, too.)
>>>>>(That rockerboy Gato from CalFree is definitely a physad
who uses his magic to liven up his act. He's smooth as silk on stage.

either.) <<<<<
-Boom (01:19:02/01-22-57)

THE INVISIBLE WAY
These guys are my opposite-or maybe my mirror image is a
better way to put it. The warrior adept in some sense lives for conflict, while the adept who follows the invisible Way carefully
avoids it. These adepts are the spies, the thieves, the silent assassins-ninjas, featherfeet killers, that kind of thing. Adepts who follow the invisible Way develop all kinds of powers that help them
move and act unseen and unheard. Some can walk through a
crowd without being noticed; I've known others who can stalk
across snow or sand and leave no footprints. Hell, most of 'em
don't even puff up dust or snow-spray. They tend to be pretty athletic, real good climbers and wizzer than wiz at illusion and
sleight of hand.

midnight stealth mission, but you're as
likely to see them using hi-tech camo covering. Just because they're adepts doesn't

When he moves all silent and unseen like Johnny Z's describing, he
calls it "becoming Mountain Lion's breath." The way he scans it,
he does what he does by imitating his totem.) <<<<<

-Mulroney (05:22:11/02-03-57)
THE SPIRIT WAY
Remember what I said before about adepts developing their
abilities naturally, sometimes without even knowing it? Well,
these guys are the exception to that rule. (You knew there had to
be one, didn't you?) Adepts who follow the spirit Way get seriously involved in their own magical natures and spend as much
time puzzling out the mysteries of astral space as any mage or
shaman. Almost all adepts who follow the spirit Way can see into
the astral, and I know quite a few who think that having a "window" into the astral plane makes them want to choose this path.
>>>>>(Physads with astral perception do tend to be a little different from the norm. They have more of a "magician-like“ attitude and are pretty good at dealing with things in the astral.) <<<<<

serious astral hoop-kicking
and are often just what the
witch doctor ordered to
protect some big noise from
a magical attack. Plenty of
these slots can handle physical bodyguarding, too. Could
be the next big thing-not many

-Capt. Chaos (00:15:40/01-21-57)

Mystic adepts turn up a lot in tribal cultures, where they're
treated like shamans. Some of the NA tribes see practically no difference between adepts who follow the spirit Way and shamans.
They figure the ability to perceive and interact with the spirit
world is what makes a shaman, not spellcasting or any other
magic tricks. A few cultures view these adepts as bad-news traffickers in evil spirits, but not many.

WAY OF THE ANIMAL POWERS
Adepts who come from the Native American Nations or
other tribal cultures often follow totems, though they don't see
their totem spirits in quite the same way as shamans do. They use
their magic differently, and so their links to their totems are different, too. The shamanic adept (jeez, I hate that name, it's so
imprecise-but what the frag, it's the one everybody knows) follows the totem as a Way, a sort of pattern to imitate or an ultimate
goal to shoot for. The shamanic adept takes the best qualities of
the totem and tries to make them his own.
>>>>>(What that does, of course, is limit their spellcasting and
conjuring to spells and spirits that "fit" with those qualities. They
work really well within those limits, but don't have as wide a range
of magical skills to draw on. The difference between shamanic
adepts and full-on shamans is kind of like the guy who's studied
one subject intensively for years and the guy who's spent his
whole life studying all kinds of drek. The one knows a lot about a
little, the other knows a little about a lot.) <<<<<

Eagle.) <<<<<
-Watcher-of-Stars (02:14:52/01-19-57)
>>>>>(Lately, I've heard rumors that some shamanic adepts follow the totems of Spider and Mantis, the solitary hunters and warriors of the insect world. Needless to say, nobody knows much of
nothin' about these adepts or their abilities, but some say they
hunt and kill insect shamans and spirits. If so, I say more power to
'em.) <<<<<

-Griff (05:45:13/01-26-57)
THE TWISTED WAY
Along with all the ways to focus the Power constructively,
there's the Way (of sorts) followed by those sorry adepts who look
inside themselves and see only hatred, aggression, and revenge.
I don't know whether these slubs are just born bad or whether
something bends 'em that way when they're little scrappers, but
either way it's a fragging shame. I've known a few twisters personally, and every single one eventually drove himself plain crazy
with his own Inner darkness. The darker emotions and instincts
just took control, until there was nothing left of the person who
used to live inside that adept's body. Don't make the mistake,
though, of thinking these guys are anything but fraggin' dangerous. When I call them sorry, I don't mean they're incompetent or
weak. They're terrific at what they do, at least until someone takes
'em down with a tranq dart and locks 'em in a rubber room for the
rest of their threescore and ten. A lot of these slots are warriors
gone bad, and they're pure killing machines. The others tend to
become twisted parodies of athlete adepts, artist adepts, you
name it. Pray you never meet a twisted adept in a dark alley, cuz
you probably won't live to tell your kiddies about it.
>>>>>(I had the misfortune to cross one of the guys Johnny's talking about, down in Atlanta's Barrens. He was a serial killer with
some kind of grudge against homeless people. Faster than a cat
on the wire and ten times as mean. Nowhere near sane,
either.) <<<<<
-Connor (23:19:50/01-20-57)
LOSING THE WAY
Adepts who fail to follow their Way quickly lose their powers.
Think of it like a monorail that jumps its track. Stop following your
Way and you lose the juice that powers your abilities. Drugs,
implants, system shocks from severe injury, mystical maladiesthe same things that drain the powers of a magician will also sap
an adept. The few people I know who've lost it haven't managed
to get the Power back, though some have tried. But then, most of
the ones I know lost it because they went way too cyber or got
themselves pretty messed up. As to whether it's possible to get
it back at all, I can't say. Maybe you can-but I'd bet only the individual adept can figure out how.
ADOPTING GEASA
Like magicians, adepts can boost their abilities by adopting
geasa. Taking a geas in accordance with his Way focuses the
adept's abilities, so the same investment of effort and power produces a greater result. In other words, you get more bang for your
buck.
An adept can place the same geas on a bunch of his abilities,
or he can adopt different geasa for different powers. 'Course, any
geas an adept adopts has to fit with his Way. A buddy of mine's
a shamanic adept who follows Owl, and just like her totem she
has incredibly sharp senses-but only at night.
As long as the adept observes his geas, he can still work the
mojo. If he breaks his geas, he's In the drek Power-wise until the
conditions of the geas are restored. For example, because my
friend the Owl adept has a geas that restricts her powers to nighttime, during the day her senses work like a mundane's.
>>>>>(Why adopt that kind of limit? I mean, why would anyone with magic ever want to be in a position where he can't use it?) <<<<<
-Curious George (22:30:44/01-18-57)
>>>>>(in my case, I don't need my magic working overtime. I do night work, and the increased ability my geas gives me after dark more than makes up for the minor inconvenience of not being able to hear dust falling by day. At night-when I need to-I can hear a single blade of grass rustle. More than once, that level of sensitivity has saved my life.) <<<<<
-Owl Moon (01:02:30/01-19-57)
INITIATION
Just like with mages and shamans (again!), initiation lets an
adept tap into the greater powers of the metaplanes and perform
metamagic. It's like trading your little old Ford runabout (you
know, the one that's held together with duct tape and only starts
during the summer months) for a new supercharged four-wheeldrive Honda. Some adepts take years before they're ready for initiation, some never are, while others are ready for the greater
mysteries real quick. It varies. Once an adept passes one initiation, he can take other initiations later. Each one increases his
powers.
An adept can become initiated through solo work or as a
member of an initiatory group. Some groups are organized by
Way, others are adepts only, and others admit both adepts and
magicians.
>>>>>(Most adept groups that I'm aware of are triple-A badnews. A lot of them are little more than private assassin squads for some bigwig or government and others are more like fraggin' cults.) <<<<<
-Kyrlin (19:01:53/01-20-57)

>>>>>(Adepts can't cast spells? Sez who? Be a little more specific with your nouns, please. Physads can't cast spells. I'm an elemental adept, and I can sling spells with the best of them. And use meta techniques like quickening and anchoring.) <<<<<

-Fat Man (07:33:21/02-01-57)
ORDEALS
Being an initiate isn't just tripping off into the metaplanes, doing metamagic, and all that other wizzer drek that only initiates can do. Before any initiation, an adept has to prove himself worthy by surviving an ordeal. An ordeal is a test of skill, power and inner strength that focuses the initiate on his Way and sparks the moments of intuition and insight that lead to greater development-providing the initiate survives the ordeal, of course.
>>>>>(Some physad ordeals can be pretty grueling, too. A friend of mine went through one to join a group of adepts. She's sworn not to speak of it, but I can tell she nearly didn't make it. A lot of these ordeals weed out the ones who can't hack it pretty fragging quick.) <<<<
-Wolfgang (22:50:19/01-30-57)
USING METAMAGIC
Adept initiates that can perceive or travel to the astral gain a greater feel for the spirit world, just like other magician initiates.
Initiated followers of the spirit Way can be real drek-kicking opponents in astral combat against spirits and other threats. Adept initiates can also use centering techniques to help them focus on their Way, shut out distractions and work more harmoniously with their bodies. Especially skillful adepts can use centering to improve their concentration in a lot of ways, using skills beyond the physical.
Adepts use as many different centering skills as other magicians. Every initiate chooses what's best suited to his Way. Here's a few centering skills used by adept initiates I know.
Chant
An adept using chant recites or sings a mantra to center himself. The mantra can be anything from the animalistic war cries of a berserker to a ballad about an ancient hero.
Dance
Ritual dance movements, shamanic Improvisation and graceful leaps and turns are all examples of dance. Many martial arts
styles, such as Capioera, make use of ritual dance-so do traditions like the whirling dervishes. Gymnastics and ballet can also be
used this way.
Kata
Kata are formalized sequences of martial arts techniques. The techniques can be slow and graceful like tai chi moves or quick and forceful. Combat attacks are not kata, but adepts can use techniques from kata in combat.
>>>>>(Every morning, I awaken my totem's spirit within my body by moving as the fox does. I suppose the Asiocentric would call that kata. I call it greeting the fox.) <<<<<
-Silver Tail (04:55:21/02-01-57)
>>>>>(Let us not forget the ancient art of carromeleg. The elegant movements of this elven warrior's art make an excellent centering technique.) <<<<<
-Lady Bright (06:22:31/02-10-57)
Kiai
A kiai is a powerful shout martial artists use to focus their energies and startle opponents. A lot of adepts use kiai to center themselves in combat.
>>>>>(Chummer of mine from the CAS calls his mystic shout a "rebel yell." He's totally ignorant of the martial arts, as least as far as all the Japanese and Chinese names go, but he knows one helluva lot about the old U.S. Civil War. Loves it to death.) <<<<<
-Davis (03:22:44/01-23-57)
Kuji-kiri
Kuji-kiri are slow, weaving hand movements once used by ninja, who believed the gestures had hypnotic and mystical powers. Different finger placements and hand movements symbolized different powers for the ninja to draw on. Nowadays, some adepts use kuji-kiri as a centering skill.
Meditation
Lots of physads center themselves with meditation. Meditation techniques used as centering skills include passive
types such as zazen and moving techniques such as tai chi.
>>>>>(I know a guy who was raised real devout Catholic, who
meditates to center himself by moving beads on a rosary. He says
he's praying, which I guess is pretty much the same thing.) <<<<<
-McKendrick (11:21:33/01-14-57)
>(As a tzaddikh. I center the power G-d gave me by silently
reciting the Shema until my mind is quiet enough to approach the
Master of the Universe.) <<<<<
-Kotzker Rebbe (21:34:23/01-14-57)
MASKING
Just like magicians, all adept initiates can mask their auras to
make themselves look like mundanes or uninitiated adepts.
Adepts who can see into the astral can try to see through the
masking of others.
FOCI
Most people think adepts can't use foci at all or can only
use weapon foci. Matter of fact, that's one of the misconceptions behind the whole deal about adepts being "less powerful" than shamans and mages. As usual, of course, the common wisdom's got it wrong. Adepts can use all kinds of foci.
How useful any given type of focus is to an adept, however,
depends on what kind of adept we're talking about. A physad
like me has a built-in limit; we're the ones who can only use
weapon foci. (Which I don't mind a bit-there's not much call
for anything else in my line of work.) An elemental, shamanic
or magical adept can use any kind of foci that runs his jack, as
long as it meshes with his abilities. For example, a chummer of
mine who's real tied into the element of earth uses fetish foci
when he slings manipulation spells. Course, he can't use a
weapon focus to save his life (literally). I also know lots of
shamanic and magical adepts who use spirit foci every time
they whistle up some spirit chummer.
Making foci is another thing altogether. Physads flat out
can't do it, though we can bond a weapon focus made for us
by our friendly neighborhood enchanter. Some folks might call
that a disadvantage-I don't. The way I see it, not being able
to make my own foci means I'll never be able to spend days
coming up with the perfect formula, weeks scouting around
for the perfect materials, and then a solid month performing
an enchanting ritual where if a single thing goes wrong, I've
spent all that time and effort for nothing. (Poor me. I'm crying. Can you tell?) Much easier to pay someone to go through
all that drek.
>>>>>(If you can afford it.) <<<<<
-Scotsman (02:11:33/01-19-57)
Most other adepts can't make their own foci, either. The only
ones I know of who can are those few magical adepts who specialize in enchanting, and they can do it every bit as well as a
mage or shaman.
>>>>>(A physical adept with a magical weapon in hand can be
one scary fragger. It's lucky they're rare.) <<<<<
-Gendarme (15:23:56/01-19-57)

-Scorpious (01:34:18/01-21-57)
>>>>>(Lots of people have tried, but no one's yet managed to

you ask me.) <<<<<
-Silicon Mage (23:12:05/02-01-57)
PHYSICAL MAGICIANS
For decades most folks believed that the abilities and mindset of a physical adept were totally incompatible with the abilities
and mindset of a magician. The thinking was, physical adepts
"grounded" their magic so strongly in their bodies that they
couldn't wrap their minds around the more complex astral manipulations of sorcery and drek like that. The two paths could never
meet, or so the idea went.
Then in 2051, an anthropologist named Helen Rainwater
began a study of ancient Japanese ninja clans. She wanted to
show that these slots in black pajamas possessed primitive
physical adept abilities. During her study, Rainwater came
across numerous local legends that seemed to show these
guys could cast spells! That led her to theorize that an undiscovered type of adept-a "physical magician"-exists.
According to Rainwater, these physical magicians have the
powers of a physical adept plus some abilities that supposedly only belong to magicians and non-physical adepts. No one's
found a real live physical magician yet, but lots of people seem
to take the idea seriously.

cast spells too?) <<<<<
-Crash (21:15:35/01-16-57)

physical magicians were just magicians with some quickened and

things without any real concentration or effort. Keep in mind that

also a fragging anthropologist. She doesn't know magic theory

him.) <<<<<

how it's spelled, for all you record-keepers out there) are coming in from every major city in
North America. So unless you want to end up on the stick end of a zombie, read on, boys and

Voudoun is a magico-religious system that exhibits elements of Yoruban religious traditions imported to the Caribbean with the slave trade, Carib practices, and Catholic symbolism.

VOUDOUN
The system's magical expression derives from its elements of preChristianized Yoruban and Carib traditions.
Voudoun originated in the islands of the Caribbean, notably
Haiti, where it is still heavily practiced. The tradition is also practiced in similar forms in many of the regions where African slaves
intermingled with European and Native American populations,
such as the French settlements in Louisiana and Spanish holdings
in South America. Other magical traditions in South and Central
America exhibit many similarities to voudoun and are considered
part of a general "family" of magical traditions descended from the African Diaspora.
>>>>>(Has anyone ever wondered why it is
that these magical traditions that are only
a couple of centuries old still work after the
Awakening? I mean, how did the people
who started all this know which techniques
were going to work?) <<<<<

-Brujo (23:45:22/01-14-57)
>>>>>(The Awakening wasn't exactly an on/off
process. There's plenty of evidence that magic worked
before 2011-it just wasn't as visible or reliable, so most people didn't believe. But "tribal" cultures like the Haitians'
refined their magical traditions over generations of study, so
when the world Awakened they had a pretty functional set
of theories to work with. The same thing happened with the
hermetic tradition, most of which developed in the past 500
years or so.) <<<<<
-Talon (21:34:40/01-18-57)
>>>>>(Keep in mind that voudoun is also based on African tribal
traditions that are thousands of years old. That's a lot of time to

-Islander (19:50:05/01-19-57)
Voudoun remains a major magical tradition of the Caribbean
League and throughout the gulf region of North America. Many
metroplexes all over North America contain followers of voudoun,
known as houngans, as well, although they are concentrated primarily in the CAS and UCAS. Reports of voudoun in Denver,
California and Seattle are now starting to become more common.
In Aztlan, the government has outlawed the practice of voudoun,
although pockets of worshipers still exist there. In Amazonia, the
government permits voudoun practice, but estimates of practitioners are unavailable. Generally, voudoun becomes more infrequent the farther south one travels.
>>>>>(There are very few voudoun practitioners in the NAN states
or Tir Tairngire. I've also heard of some underground practitioners
in England, where the regular population despises them. A few
scattered houngans can be found in the rest of the world, but
good luck tracking them down. The majority of houngans are orks
and human, and most are relatively downtrodden-voudoun
seems to appeal to the oppressed. About 5 percent of houngans
are elves and trolls, and about 1 percent are dwarfs.) <<<<<
-StatsMan (10:47:16/01-21-57)
The Rada tradition, the most predominant form of Haitian
voudoun, is the most religious and popular form of
voudoun. A darker voudoun tradition, known
as the Petro tradition, uses voudoun rites to
invoke power for harmful ends or personal
gain. Many Petro practices center around
violence. Petro reminds us that voudoun was
born in the crucible of slavery, well stirred by
men with whips and brands.

-Lucky (03:12:66/01-20-57)
MAJOR LOA
The central element of all voudoun traditions is the invocation
of a powerful spirit called a loa, which possesses the worshiper.
During possession, the loa's mount (the worshiper or other host
body) becomes a vessel for the loa. The mount speaks with the
loa's voice, acts like the loa, virtually becomes the loa.
The houngans view loa as gods-or great spirits-of
voudoun. Like the totems of shamanic traditions, the loa provide
their followers with a means to understand and use the magical
energies that flow through the world. But unlike shamanic totems,
voudoun loa often intervene directly in worldly matters by pos
sessing worshipers. Traditional shamanic traditions contain no
comparable practice.

standing there chanting, the next he was squirming on the ground
like a snake and shouting gibberish. I still have dreams about
it.) <<<<<
-MWS (16:20:01/01-21-57)
I have taken the liberty of describing the major loa of the
voudoun tradition. Voudoun practitioners recognize numerous
lesser loa as well, but most of these lesser loa appear to be regional interpretations or aspects of these major loa.
>>>>>(Dr. Dumaillier goes on to describe the loa in the most boring, clinical, dull way possible. You could tell he finds the whole loa
thing suspect. So I deleted his material and went out to find someone who could add a little passion to the loa. I contacted some
friends and called in some markers. I was finally introduced to a
houngan named Top Hat. Ms. Hat took time out of her day to chat
and do us all a favor. She jotted down some entertaining descriptions of the loa. If you're ever in Denver, look up Ms. Top Hat and
tell her Talon says "Hi!") <<<<<
-Talon (08:26:25/01-12-57)
AGWE: SOVEREIGN OF THE SEA
Agwe is the regal and noble Ruler of the Sea. He is a giver of
great peace, a strong and mighty loa who lives in a fantastic court
below the waves, where he often entertains his fellow loa. Agwe's
moods change as quickly as the waters of the Sea, and only fools
do not fear his terrible temper. For as long as any man can remember, Agwe has fought with his rival, Ogoun, the God of Fire, for
both of these mighty loa are filled with a passion for the loa
Erzulie, the Mistress of Love.
Agwe's mounts act regal and dignified, like the noble Ruler
himself. To invite Agwe, the mount must baptize himself in water
to signify his ancient link to the sea. Agwe will remain as long as
the mount is wet. Because he is the Ruler of the Sea, Agwe also
rescues any followers he finds drowning.
Every year, Agwe's followers gather at the seashore. There,
they take the ritual bath to mark themselves as Children of the Sea
and load a raft with a fine feast. Then they take the raft out into the
waves and sink it, so that Agwe can share the gifts of the earth
with his fellow loa.
In the Petro rite, Agwe is the Angry Sea, dark and dangerous
and filled with destructive power.
AZACA: MASTER OF THE CORN
Azaca is the Keeper of the Soil, the Cultivator of Life, fertility
itself. For many, many years, Azaca was the little brother to the
other loa, the weakest of the great loa on the islands. But in recent
times, Azaca has gained many followers among the Carib and
corn-growing tribes of Aztlan.
Azaca is always eager and helpful to his followers, but he can
also be hasty like a child, rushing off at the first chance. Any time
someone plants or harvests in a garden or field, he calls on Azaca
to ensure his success.
Thankfully, Azaca is not called on in Petro rites.
DAMBALLAH: GOOD SERPENT OF THE SKY
Damballah Wedo is the Great Good Sky Father. He is the oldest of the loa, worshiped by the first man. Damballah appears as a
shimmering white serpent flying across the sky. Often, his companion, Ayida the Rainbow, flies next to him, and together the
two loa circle the World Egg of Creation. Damballah has great wisdom, because he encircles all of creation and has seen everything.
He is the bringer of peace and dignity and master of the elements.
Damballah is very old, and of all the loa he least resembles
man. Those mounted by him writhe on the ground like snakes,
hissing and often climbing and hanging from trees. Damballah
rarely speaks in any tongue of man.
Damballah is a force of good. He cannot be called in Petro rites.
>>>>>(This is the guy I saw. Wow! You know, thinking back on it, his
advice did get us out of a few jams.) <<<<<

>>>>>(And which non-human tongue do you speak.
MWS?) <<<<<
-Shadowdancer (20:11:39/01-21-57)
ERZULIE: MISTRESS OF LOVE
Love and Passion are the domain of Erzulie. She is incredibly
beautiful, sensual and loving-the greatest of all women. Beware
her possessive streak, though, for she can be shrill and violently
jealous. Erzulie demands much, but she also gives much in return.
She is the Mistress of Dreams and grants men the ability to see
beyond their world.
All of the loa love the beautiful Erzulie and many often fight for
her attentions. She is Agwe's wife Siren in one of her aspects,
Ogoun's passionate lover in another and Damballah's mate in a third.
Those ridden by Erzulie become sensual and charming, gifted with incredible passion and charisma. The loa loves gifts of fine
clothes, perfumes and jewelry, and she wears such beautiful
things whenever she can.
The Petro distort the love and passion of Erzulie. In the Petro
her name is Ge-Rouge- of the Red Eyes-and she is passion
scorned and jealous rage.
LEGBA: OLD MAN AT THE CROSSROADS
Papa Legba is the Divine Sun. He is an old man who serves
as the center-post of all things, a bridge between the visible world
of the living and the invisible world of the loa. He is Guardian and
Gatekeeper, God of the Crossroads and Opener of the Way. He is
always the first of the loa to be called on with the invocation,
"Papa Legba, ouvri barie pour nous passer" (open the way for us
to pass). He is revered for his great knowledge and wisdom.
Legba's mounts become like old men. Their limbs grow
weak, twisted and bent, and they walk
slowly and painfully. But the houngan's voice becomes forceful
and commanding, filled with
wisdom and charisma.
The Petro distort Legba's wisdom and power. They call Legba
the Abysmal Night, or Carrefour, Master of the Crossroads and
Ruler of the Demons of Night and III Chance. They invoke him for
his power over the creatures of the night. The Petro claim this
power as protection, but protection to a Petro usually means
harm to anyone who opposes him.
GHEDE: CORPSE, CLOWN AND KING
Ghede is my mait tete, my patron loa. I am bonded more
strongly to Ghede than to any other loa, and I always call on him
first whenever I deal with the loa. But a houngan can call on any
loa, not just her mait tete-this causes much of the jealousies
among the loa.
Ghede is the most misunderstood of the loa. I do not wish to
mislead anyone-it is true that Ghede is the Dark Abyss, the loa
of Death and Twilight into which the sun must set. But Ghede is
also the Protector of the Cosmic Void, the place where all life
springs forth. Ghede sometimes is called the Lord of Resurrection,
because he is master over both life and death. Ghede is a powerful healer and guardian of children as well, which many people
forget.
Ghede is not a demon, but rather a sly and humorous figure,
both greedy and clever. Ghede loves to shock others with his biting wit. He also loves food, the grander and more exotic the feast
the better, for Death consumes all things.
Before mounting I dress in Ghede's "formal" costume of top
hat, black tailcoat, sunglasses, cigarette and cane. When Ghede
mounts me he fills me with a wicked sense of humor. I drink and
eat enough to make a troll pass out, but I never feel ill when
Ghede leaves me.
The Petro call Ghede Baron Samedi, the Loa of Graveyards,
Evil Magic and Zombies. Baron Samedi's followers are the most
evil and the most feared of the practitioners of dark voudoun. I
damn all the Petro to the darkest hole in the abyss for the evil they
have done to this noble loa.
>>>>>(So where are you now, Samedi? Cat got your tongue? Or
should I just call you Baron.) <<<<<
-Lucky (03:24:02/01-20-57)
LOCO AND AYIZAN: THE PRIESTLY PARENTS
Loco and Ayizan are the First Priest and Priestess, our Adam
and Eve. Long, long ago, they were man and woman. They worshiped and cared for the loa more than they cared for themselves,
and the grateful loa rewarded them by sending a great horse. The
horse rode through the sky and returned to Guinee, home of the
loas, who welcomed Loco and Ayizan into their family.
Loco is Adam, the Perfect Man, the ultimate male. In many
ways he resembles Legba, for Loco is a walker between the
worlds and yet stands at the center of reality.
Ayizan is Eve, the Perfect Woman. Nurturing and creative,
she brings forth life. Ayizan is the loa of prosperity and from prosperity comes wealth.
Together, Loco and Ayizan complete one another. Every
houngan strives to be like Loco and Ayizan as much as possible
and one day become worthy to sit in Guinee with them.
Loco and Ayizan are always worshiped by inseparable pairs
of houngans. Many are husband and wife. Many are just lovers.
This is a strange relationship, even stranger to those who do not
practice voudoun.
Loco and Ayizan mount with great subtlety. You can only tell
they have mounted when they speak. They speak with the voice
of perfection. Unlike the other loa, only males follow Loco, and
only females follow Ayizan.
The Petro don't acknowledge Loco
and Ayizan.
OGOUN: WARRIOR, HERO, POLITICIAN
Ogoun is the Lord of Thunder, the God of Fire, the Iron Warrior. He is might, power,
authority and triumph. Since the Awakening, Ogoun has also been worshiped as the
Diplomat, Politician and Master Trader. Handsome, dashing and passionate, Ogoun
is an active and strong lover. In
fact, he is Erzulie's most aggressive lover among the loa.
Ogoun's mounts act like soldiers,
marching about, calling out orders and barking commands.
The mounts usually carry sabers-Ogoun's symbol of authority.
The mount has great resistance to pain and injury as well. I have
seem Ogoun's mounts strike and jab themselves with their
sabers, but the blade never cuts or pierces the skin.
The Petro call Ogoun the Iron Warrior and worship
him as a force of violence.
>>>>>(Pretty good drek by one who believes. Thanks again, Top Hat. And now back to our regularly scheduled article by Dr. Dumaillier.) <<<<<
-Talon (09:00:55/01-12-57)
CALLING THE LOA
A houngan can call on any
loa with whom he has established
good relations to enter his body
and possess, or "mount," him. The
loa riding the houngan grants him
various powers. However, the houngan's control over
his own actions is very limited while he is possessed by
a loa.
The loa departs when it has finished the task for
which the houngan called it, or whenever it wishes.
Generally, the houngan is left exhausted from the
ordeal.
>>>>>(There are stories of loa possession before the Awakening.
But if my research is correct, they required long and involved rituals full of drumming, dancing and singing, hallucinogenic drug
ingestion, self-inflicted torture and sensory deprivation. Under
those circumstances, I'm pretty sure I'd be commanding some
great spirits, too. But since the Awakening, a few chants is all that's
needed.] <<<<<
-Doug H. (20:54:10/01-15-57)
>>>>>(Calling the loa is easier, true, but they are not mere spirits to
be commanded.) <<<<<
-Islander (00:12:20/01-20-57)
A houngan may also summon a loa to mount a willing and
worthy subject other than himself. Such an individual is known
as a serviteur, literally "servant of the loa." The serviteur gains all
of the normal benefits of loa possession. However, because they
lack the bond with the loa that the houngan possesses, serviteurs are much more likely to be overwhelmed by the personality of the possessing loa and are less capable of taking actions
on their own.
>>>>>(I was on a run down in bayou country once and ran up
against this punk chromer. I'd seen many of them in the Sprawl and
knew I could kick this slot's hoop with null sweat. What I didn't know
was that he was a serviteur. So there I am, ready to kick some poseur
butt, and he starts acting like Ogoun the Iron Warrior! It seems I was
a bit too close to something some houngans held dear. Well. chummers, that razorboy was damn fast and much better than any punk
like him had a right to be. Scary. Barely came out alive. And I'm told
I have forever made Ogoun angry.) <<<<<
Impact (02:16:32/01-17 57)
There are also cases of loa occasionally mounting a houngan
or serviteur without being called. Such possessions are said to be
warnings for a loyal follower of some danger or possible offense,
or punishments for followers who have offended the loa. In the
latter case, the loa often possesses the follower and puts him
through a series of exhausting and embarrassing trials, apparently to teach him the error of his ways.
>>>>>(Scary thought. So a houngan could call a loa up and have
it possess someone, making them into a puppet?) <<<<<
-Silk (20:30:04/01-16-57)
>>>>>(Houngans have plenty of other ways to turn someone into
a puppet without resorting to the loa.) <<<<<
-Samedi (23:58:50/01-19-57)
>>>>>(There are documented cases of loa mounting skeptical
nonbelievers who have attended their rituals with a bad attitude,
but no records of loa performing such feats at the behest of a
houngan. That other drek is pretty much confined to simflicks and
Petro rituals. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you,
Samedi?) <<<<<
-Islander (20:52:02/01-21-57)
The loa are a fractious lot, with distinct personalities and
habits. Therefore, a houngan must carefully balance the delicate
relations between the various loa when calling on them. Agwe
and Ogoun, for example, are rivals in many areas and do not get
along at all. On the other hand, all loa respect and honor Legba as
the Opener of the Way and emissary to the material world. A
houngan presiding over a ceremony at which many loa are
expected to be present is often likened to a host who must carefully consider the personal relations of the guests on the list and
make arrangements for everyone's comfort.
Often a houngan will call on his mait tete to help him navigate the treacherous jealousies of the loa. Each voudoun follower
has a mait tete (literally "master of the head") loa. The mait tete is
the loa that most closely resembles the houngan's own personality and serves as the houngan's personal patron. However, unlike
shamans who follow only their own totem, a houngan may interact with many, even all, of the loa at one point or another.
>>>>>(Many houngans use the mait tete in much the same way
other people use astrological signs. For them, the mait tete is simply a way to describe someone's personality. It's no surprise that
someone who is aggressive and forceful has Ogoun for a mait
tete, for example.) <<<<<
-Islander (20:31:46/01-18-57)
>>>>>(I guess that's why a 60-year-old grandma smokes cigars,
dresses in a tux and goes around drinkin' and eatin' until she nearly passes out. I want to party with Top Hat.) <<<<<
-Lucky (18:39:55/01-21-57)
As houngans advance in initiation, they may contact and make
connections with other loa. To do so, the houngan must undertake a
spirit quest to Guinee, the Island Beneath the Sea where the loa
dwell, to convince the loa to accept the bond. Because of the jealousies among the loa, creating new bonds becomes more and more
difficult as the houngan increases his connections to different loa.
WORK LOA
In addition to the more powerful and well-known major loa,
houngans may also call on the loa travail, literally "work loa." These
minor powers are comparable to the watcher spirits of hermetic
magic traditions. The voudoun tradition holds that loa travail are the
departed spirits of (meta)human beings that are called back from
the depths of the mirror world. While some work loa often exhibit
a faintly humanoid appearance on the astral plane, it seems unlikely that these spirits are the astral forms of the deceased.
To conjure a work loa, a houngan requires an honfour (a temple or ritual site) and a govi (a red clay jar used to hold the work
loa). When they are not performing a service for their master, the
spirits reside in the govi. Damage to the govi also affects the spirits, and if the jar is destroyed all of the spirits contained in it are disrupted. This practice of holding and controlling spirits, rather than
calling them forth as in most hermetic and shamanic traditions,
appears to be unique to voudoun. The practice has yet to be
explained by houngans or the larger magical research community.
Houngans also use govis to conjure and contain other spiritual energies and to form astral links when performing ritual sorcery. Each houngan traditionally fashions his own govi from the
earth near his honfour and enchants it for use as a magical vessel.
>>>>>(I've heard you can use a govi to steal someone's spirit or
astral form and turn them into something called an "astral zombie." Any truth to that?) <<<<<<
-Starfall (17:53:10/01-13-57)
>>>>>(I've heard those rumors, too. As far as I know, that's all they
are-rumors. There's no confirmation of a houngan ever being
able to do something like that.) <<<<<
-Archangel (20:45:30/01-15-57)
>>>>>(Rumors can kill you, boys and girls. Have you ever thought
that these "astral zombies" are nothing more than work loa?) <<<<<
-Walker (21:15:20/01-17-57)
BOUGHT LOA
Loa achete, or "bought loa," appear to be "free" work loa.
These free spirits seem to prefer areas where voudoun is practiced,
another unexplained phenomena related to voudoun practices.
A houngan can convince a loa achete to serve him by offering it some service or payment in return or by learning and using
the spirit's "true name," a much more dangerous technique.
>>>>>(Just when you think you've learned everything. From what
I heard, these loa achete are even more treacherous than regular free spirits. They'll do just about anything to escape servitude.
Believe it or not, reaching some kind of bargain with one seems to
work better than trying to command it. The spirit doesn't seem to
mind so long as it's getting something out of the deal.) <<<<<
-Brujo (21:20:11/01-15-57)
>>>>>(Naturally enough, because such agreements usually result
in the spirit increasing its power. And word is they can become

-Samedi (23:54:56/01-17-57)

GUINEE
Voudoun mythology begins with the mystical home of the
loa, a place called Guinee. Guinee, also known as the Land
Beneath the Sea, is the ancestral world of all loa. According to
houngans, Guinee exists beyond the mirror world of les invisibles
(astral space). Guinee may actually be a metaplane-magical
scholars suggest that it may be the same as the shamanic
Metaplane of Man-but proving or disproving this hypothesis is
impossible.
A houngan may make a spirit journey to Guinee for any number of reasons: to gain wisdom from the loa, to seek out other loa,
and to form bonds with them. On a journey to Guinee, the astral
traveler must prove his worthiness by defeating challenges from
the various loa and their servants. These challenges range from
answering riddles at the crossroad gates to escaping terrible sea
creatures that dwell in the dark waters that surround Guinee. If
successful, the traveler reaches the Island Beneath the Sea and
may seek out the loa he wishes to meet.
>>>>>(Do houngans really meet the loa?) <<<<<<
-The Kid (18:43:28/01-15-57)
>>>>>(It doesn't really matter if they meet them or not. Kid. The
houngan believe that they do and that's good enough for me. It's
hard enough to find anyone who believes in anything these days,
so if Top Hat says she goes to the underwater village of Guinee
and chats with her mait tete about the Urban Brawl scores, I
believe her.) <<<<<
-Brujo (05:19:27/01-16-57)
HONFOURS
The honfour is a temple in which the loa are worshiped and
houngans performs magic. Typically, honfours are circular huts
built around a poteau-mitain (center post), with small altars and
storage areas for fetishes and other magical tools to one side.
Elaborate diagrams, known as vevers, are sketched out on the
honfour floor with flour or ash for performing rituals such as the
summoning of a work loa.
>>>>>(Honfours are the temples of voudoun. They are sacred ground
to the loa. The honfour contains the houngan's magical implements
and serves as a dwelling place for his servitor spirits.) <<<<<

-Tangent (04:32:24/01-21-57)
>>>>>(Not a bad idea. but very dangerous. Honfours are well protected. Houngans often share a single honfour as well, so you
might end up rakking off an entire voudoun secret society by just
jandering up and scragging one honfour.) <<<<<
-Ambros (20:16:43/01-22-57)
BOCORS
In the voudoun tradition, a bocor is a magician who uses his
powers without the benevolent supervision and guidance of the
loa. Traditionally, houngans considered bocors as mercenary individuals with little regard for the larger community. Since the
Awakening, this attitude has changed somewhat. Houngans are
much more accepting of shamans and hermetics, and they
reserve the term bocor for magicians who sell their services to the
highest bidder, regardless of the consequences. Corporate and
government magicians and shadowrunning magicians are examples of the typical bocor.
In some smaller communities, bocors are still feared for their
power, and many cultivate this fearsome reputation.
>>>>>(Hey, I bet this is the first time wage slaves and runners were
ever lumped together.) <<<<<
-Niall (13:45:16/01-18-57)

bocors as an occasional necessity. Not cut and dried at all.) <<<<<

-Ms. Majestyk (18:54:31/01-22-57)
SORCERY
Sorcery is considered a force separate from the loa in the
voudoun tradition. Voudoun sorcery makes heavy use of fetishes of
all kinds, including dried insects, herbal powders, bones, rum or
other liquor, stones, symbols, drums, rattles, weapons, ritual clothing and jewelry. It is often connected with ritual sorcery from which
the ubiquitous "voodoo doll" of popular mythology derives. The
"dolls" used in these rituals are actually ritual links fashioned of
wax, clay or straw. Each doll contains a genetic sample from its target, such as a lock of hair or a few drops of blood, and is fashioned
to resemble the target. These features increase the symbolic correspondence between the link and the target of the ritual.

PETRO RITE
So far, I have described the Rada rite, the most common
form of the voudoun tradition. But no discussion of voudoun
would be complete without mention of so-called dark
voudoun, more precisely known as the Petro rite. The Petro
rite focuses on the forces of violence, anger and the dark powers of the night. Followers of this rite, sometimes known simply as "Petros," seem to believe that life is a vengeful path
controlled by the most powerful.
The Petro loa are darker versions of the Rada loa. Practitioners of
Petro believe that the loa exist purely to serve them in their attempts
to gain power on the physical and other planes of existence. Petro
practitioners are recognized as a dangerous group and many locales
in the UCAS and CAS have outlawed the practice of the Petro rite.

ZOMBIES
The zombie is the most famous voudoun phenomenon- and the
most misunderstood-largely as a result of nearly 100 years of horror
films and trideos. Actually, the term zombie is used to describe individuals in three distinct conditions-true zombies, corps cadavres, and
loa zombies. Note that zombies are largely the domain of Petro practitioners-houngans of the Rada rite shun all zombification practices.
The oldest and most common form of zombie is the true
zombie. True zombies are created with the use of wambele, a
powerful biochemical powder more commonly known as "zombie dust." First, the houngan prepares wambele with various neurotoxic plants according to rites passed on in the Petro tradition.
Today, the powder can also be created with synthetic neurotoxins. Then, the victim is made to ingest the powder. Traditionally,
the wambele was spread across the victim's doorway, where it
came into contact with bottoms of the victim's bare feet. In recent
years, wambele has been mixed in a victim's food or drink or
injected directly into the victim's bloodstream. Once the victim
ingests the powder, he enters a death-like trance.
After the victim has been pronounced dead and buried, the
houngan and his servants unearth the victim and apply a potion
that negates the effects of the wambele and deadens the victim's
will as well. Any chemical compound can be used, provided it
restores partial consciousness to the victim without restoring him
enough to fight back. Nowadays the houngan can easily control
the victim with spells. In recent years, houngans have also intentionally addicted their zombies to psychoactive drugs, which provides an additional means of controlling the victim.
>>>>>(WHAT PLANET IS DR. VOODOO FROM! You can't make zombie dust from store-bought chemicals. If that was the case, every
talismonger in the world would have the drek on his shelf. It's strictly native and rare. The addiction drek is true, though, just don't ask
me how I know. ) <<<<<

been known to sentence someone they found guilty of a crime to
serve out their punishment as a zombie as a means of teaching
them a lesson.) <<<<<
-Archangel (20:05:55/01-18-57)

Corps cadavres and loa zombies are created by animating dead
victims. Houngans create a corps cadavre by animating a victim with
an animation spell. A houngan creates a loa zombie by animating a
victim with the inhabitation power of loa. Both processes create
shambling beings with very low intelligence, little or no sensitivity to
pain, and little or no remorse or other emotions. The Rada rite strictly prohibits the creation of corpse cadavre and loa zombies.

AWAKENED VOUDOUN
Voudoun has always been a highly adaptive tradition, borrowing liberally from other faiths, such as Catholicism, for symbolism, while retaining a solid core of beliefs and traditions. Since
the Awakening, many voudoun splinter sects have borrowed from
shamanic and even hermetic magical traditions. Some of these
sects even recognize new loa that inhabit the Sixth World, loa that
houngans are beginning to know only now.
Ceremonies of these so-called Awakened sects use simsense
and virtual-reality technology to generate the trance states associated with voudoun worship. Some elaborate rituals take place entirely in virtual reality simulations of complex honfours with sophisticated sensory images of the loa and their symbols. Some members of
these sects have even claimed to have seen loa spirits in the Matrix.

LONE STAR'S WIZBOYS
by Casper
OK, everybody reading this post knows that the Star has combat mages on its FastResponse and SWAT teams. Most of you probably also know that SWAT and FRT teams also
include a lot of physical adepts. And anyone who's ever had the bad luck to run into a Star FRT
or SWAT team knows that the above-mentioned wizboys are major bad news. But I'd bet
nuyen to noodles that an awful lot of you who know this stuff never really thought about the
hundreds of ways the Star can frag with your little shadowrun. So I'm here to fill you in on some
of their favorite tricks and tactics, and to suggest a few ways you
can frag with them right back.

of way-out-in-the-stratosphere theory.) <<<<<

FUN WITH COMBAT MAGES
Consider the typical Star combat mage. He's pretty goodtook a few Advanced Level Magic courses in high school and
showed enough promise at the dirty-fighting side of things to
attract the attention of a Lone Star recruiter. These guys don't get
heavily into theory; they're not the ones clogging up the classrooms at UC Berkeley or MIT&M. They want to know the quickest, most efficient way to sling juju that'll stop people in their tracks; once they get that, they chuck theory out the airlock. You know the old saying about, "A little knowledge is a dangerous thing"? Well, the Lone Star combat wizboy has his own version of it: "A little knowledge can help you do a fraggin' truckload of damage."
So the Star recruiter sends Wizboy Willy (or whoever) off to
summer school at the local HQ. There, our high-school graduate
(or dropout with a lot of talent) learns the finer points of the art of
magical mayhem. He learns how to sling the most powerful spells
he's capable of, as fast as possible, with as little drain as possible
so he can keep going for as long as possible. He finds out exactly what his limits are, and how to walk that edge without pushing
himself over it. And he learns from the war stories of all the other
combat mages in the Star-all the little tricks they know, all the
clever dodges every shadowrunner's ever pulled on them, and
what they did about it. He learns not only from his own mistakes,
but also from everybody else's in the whole organization. So what
we have here, kids, is a mageboy who likes being on the front
line, is good at taking people down with minimal hurt to himself,
is practically never stupid enough to overextend himself in a
scrap, and rarely makes the same mistake twice. Most important,
our Wizboy Willy of the Star is the guy you will run into eventually-unless you plan on confining your biz to swiping benefit
checks from little old ladies in the Barrens (about whom the Star
cares precisely zero).
I know what most of you are probably thinking right now,
because I thought it myself. "So what if he rarely makes the same
mistake twice? Once is all it takes to kill the fragger." Well, that's
true ... but the trick is to recognize his mistake before it gets done
happening and take advantage of it while you can.
In addition to full heavy armor and at least three guns with all
the bells and whistles (smartlink Ils, gas vents, thermo scopes and
such), your typical FRT combat mage packs at least four magical
toys: a couple of spell locks to enhance his armor spell and personal combat sense, plus a power focus and a spirit focus. Loaded
for bear, right? Well, being magically loaded for bear is a twoedged sword. Sure, the wizboy's foci give him extra juice when
he needs it. They also give Joe Shadowrunner a nice little channel
down which to shoot some pre-emptive mojo. So if a runner magicboy can whip up a physical spell nice and fast-while staying out
of the Star mage's line of sight and dodging bullets from the rest
of the FRT team-and then sling it at the Starboy's power focus,
BOOM goes the Star mage. That old saw about geeking the mage
first works on them as well as us, cobbers, and don't you forget it.
>>>>>(That piece of advice is assuming an awful lot of luck,
Casper. First off, the Star's focus has to be active-which means
you've got to know it's active, which means at least astral perception on your part. That makes you astrally active, and just as
vulnerable as the magecop. Then, assuming he's distracted
enough with other things to keep from burning a spell at you right
away, you've got to step into his line of sight in order to fling your
juiceball. If you can see him, he can see you, and burn you before
he cacks it. I don't care much for suicide tactics-if I take a magecop down, I'd rather not go with him. And I'm not even going to
talk about the flying lead.) <<<<<

-Spelling B (01:34:21/02-03-57)
>>>>>(B's got a point, but you can cut a mageboy down easy with
a little teamwork. Even an FRT mage with personal combat sense
to burn can get confused if there's enough people throwing
enough drek at him. My chummers and I survived a nasty fire fight
that way awhile back. We were helping ourselves to the contents
of a certain warehouse when we got word that an FRT team was
on the way, ETA about three minutes. We could've bailed, but
they'd just have chased us down on the docks. We'd figured
beforehand that they might try to crash our little party, so we did
like we'd planned back at our squat-picked ourselves the heaviest of our newly acquired bang-bang, planted the rest in every
nook and cranny we could find, spread ourselves out, and waited.
Sure enough, they came crashing through the roof with all their
cannons blazing. A pair of combat mages in the center, protected
by the blizzard of gunfire their chummers were laying down. We
started shooting from all directions, running in and out through piles
of crates and boxes like mice in a maze, picking up a new gun
whenever we found one and letting fly. Confused the frag out of
'em-the Star couldn't tell who was shooting from where, or which
of us was the biggest threat. They broke their cordon around the
mages, and one mageboy covered the other one's back with his
assault rifle while the other one threw fireballs at stacks of boxes.
They couldn't see us, so they had to toss their mojo pretty much at
random and hope they caught somebody in the area of effect.
They caught Louie-crisped the poor slot pretty good when the
stack of crates he was hiding behind caught fire and fell on him. At
the height of all the confusion, one of our mages scrounged up a
water elemental and sent it crashing into the warehouse, and
about half a second later the other one sent a manaball through
the mage that had been tossing fire. Blowed up his power focus
real good and fried his buddy. Also fried a couple of the mundane
troopers who'd been standing too close. The water elemental
swept another bunch of 'em off their feet, and we took our
chance to bail out while they were still floundering. By the time they
got back up and figured out we'd hoofed it, we were speeding
away from there.) <<<<<

-MasterBlaster
(12:13:44/02-05-57)
Also, always remember that there's more than one way to geek the mage. One
of my personal fave tactics is to toss an overstimulation spell at the nearest combat mage as soon as I spot him.
While he's coping with sudden and total disorientation, a buddy with a gun can pop him. Astral static is another good
"distraction" spell, especially if you run into an FRT on the grounds
of a corp research facility. Astral static raises the background
count in a given area, making it tougher to do anything on the
astral plane-look around, sling spells, whatever. The background
count at a corp facility is usually higher than the average; if you
toss an astral static spell, you can raise the count high enough to
seriously frag with anything a Lone Star mage might be trying to
do. Of course, you incapacitate yourself at the same time-so
once again, let your friendly neighborhood gunsel step in and finish the slot once you've done your part. (And make sure you step
away from the Star mage's line of sight right away-some of them
are good enough to throw at least a little something, even against
a nasty background count. Don't assume the Starboy's helpless
just because you've made his life difficult.) Of course, both these
tactics assume you're well armed; if you're not, you shouldn't be
in this biz.

-Talon (22:34:41/01-14-57)

be just about all the timeequip everybody on your
team with nose plugs and

you need to. I don't care
how well trained a cop isnobody, but nobody, can
totally resist reacting physically to a sudden blast of a
real stench. We're talking
something that smells like a
chicken farm plus a couple
of rotting corpses plus an
open sewer, multiplied at
least ten times. The Star
mages and gunsels may not
all lose their breakfasts, but they'll lose concentration for a few
seconds. Sometimes, that's all it takes.) <<<<<
-Santa Maria (04:13:33/01-16-57)
Of course, geeking the mage isn't the only way to use magic
against the Star. Sometimes, the most effective tactic is to bring
out your biggest guns right away and let fly. I'm talking flame
bombs, folks. Have a flame bomb spell ready to go the second the
FRT team busts in-if you can sling it fast enough, while they're
still in tight formation, you can geek most of the team just by
cooking off their ammo. Your average FRT team packs enough
wallop to make a truly spectacular fireball. Just make sure you're
far enough away not to take damage yourself.
>>>>>(Fire elementals are good for that, too.) <<<<<
-Talon (10:22:31/01-16-57)

So now that you know a few creative ways to geek the mage,
I'm going to tell you not to-at least, not if you can help it. And
you can help it in a lot of situations, common wisdom to the contrary. Incapacitation can be every bit as effective-try throwing
astral static or overstimulation or chaotic world, and then just
book without having your sammy buddy take a shot. This
assumes, of course, that booking is an option. If you can't get out
of town for some reason, then taking the slags down may be your
only choice. If you can, though, try to stick with non lethal action.
"Don't geek the cop" might sound like a weird piece of advice,
but there's sound reason for it. The Star, just like the civil police
forces we used to have in the UCAS, doesn't take kindly to people who kill cops. If you cack one-or several-you've just given
the Star a reason to hunt you down and geek you no matter how
tough the going gets. Don't bring that kind of trouble on yourself
unless you have to-you'll live longer that way.

though, that your SWAT mage is just a bit more powerful than your
average FRT wizboy. Like, they both might sling a mana bolt spell,
but the SWAT mage's will be more powerful. (Of course, either
one'll kill you just as dead.) Also, the SWAT boys have a definite
preference for physical spells that do a hell of a lot of damage.
Your FRT wizworm is just as likely to toss something that frags with
your perception, like overstimulation, as he is to toss a powerball.
Not because he's any kind of a softer touch (believe me!), but
because he thinks it's a more elegant solution (or some such
drek).) <<<<<
-Shostakovich (11:35:55/01-17-57)
FUN WITH PHYSICAL ADEPTS
In addition to spell slingers, the Star loves to put physical
adepts on SWAT and FRT teams. These guys can be a serious problem; they can move so fragging fast that they're putting your head
on backward while you're just getting your powerball spell started. A lot of them also have such impressive control over their
bodies that they can resist gases and toxins and such-so anybody out there thinking of hitting the FRT team with a burst of
knockout gas, keep in mind that the adept will probably still be
standing. (And he won't be any too pleased with you, either.) And
here's another scary thing about them-their own powers can
give them the same "extra armor" and personal combat sense
that the average Star mageboy has, without the need for spell
locks. That means you can't turn their active spell locks against
them by sending a physical spell through one.
All that said, however, you can deal with physads should you
be unlucky enough to encounter one in the course of your shady
escapades. One obvious way to do it is to fight fire with fire; if you're
going someplace where you might expect to meet one of these
slots, make sure you've got a physad on your team to take him on.
When dealing with the Star, it's a good idea to have more than one
physad; Lone Star FRTs don't put the same number of physads on
every team, so you can't know in advance how many you may face
(if any at all). As a rule of thumb, most FRT and SWAT teams include
one to three physads-the reason for the upper limit is that physical
adepts don't exactly grow on trees. (Lucky for us, too.)
The other way to deal with physads is to hit them where
they're weakest-on the astral plane. In my experience, it's
almost impossible to beat a top-flight physical adept in physical
combat unless you're just as drek-hot a physad as he is. However,
mages and shamans can nail the physad astrally if they're alert
enough to take advantage of circumstances. Spirits make excellent weapons-they can wait until the very last fraction of a second before manifesting, and even a talented physical adept has
trouble reacting fast enough to hurt or escape them. A mage
buddy of mine likes to whistle up earth elementals and tell them
to engulf the physad, rendering his impressive physical combat
abilities pretty well useless.
>>>>>(I like asking local city spirits to fill a whole FRT team with fear.
The spirit doesn't even have to manifest to use its power, so there's
no target for a physad to attack. Every time I use this tactic, the
FRT boys slaughter each other. They've all got the biggest guns in
the immediate vicinity, and so perceive each other as the deadliest threat. For once they get to be on the receiving end of the
Star's "Shoot first, ask questions later" policy.) <<<<<

Of course, you can't use astral measures like spirits and spells
against a physical adept any old time. The adept has to be astrally active in order for a spirit or a spell to affect him, which means
you've got to hit him while he's astrally perceiving something. So
watch him closely and be prepared to work fast.

Keep in mind that a physad can't astrally project; so if he's
fighting a spell cast or a spirit summoned by an astrally projecting
mage, the mage has a distinct edge in reaction time. Yes, friends,
this is the one circumstance in which you can "move" faster than
the physad. Don't waste this advantage-you won't get many of
them when you're fighting these guys. One thing, though-if you
go completely astral to take on a physad, make sure your body is
safe behind enemy lines. Don't go astral in the middle of the fragging street or just around the corner, or your meat body will be
dead as the proverbial doornail within seconds.

FUN WITH REGULAR COPS
Pay attention now. The following is the most important lesson
you will ever learn. Mundane Star troopers can have magic, too.
No, they can't toss spells ... but yes, Virginia, they can sure as drek
resist the juju you throw at them. Especially the mundanes on the
FRTs-they've got mage buddies in whose company they risk their
lives every time they hit the streets. Do their mage buddies give
them a little magical helping hand? Just as sure as elves got pointy
ears, they do. I've run across mundane troopers with personal antibullet barrier spells cast on them and quickened to work permanently. A couple years ago, some people raised this issue in the
Lone Star post; it's still true. Barrier spells, increased reactions,
combat sense-the ordinary gunnies may have just about anything
that can help them survive a mini-war in the streets.
>>>>>(I read that post. Didn't somebody say that kinda magical
augmentation wasn't standard op procedure?) <<<<<
-Curious George (05:12:13/01-22-57)
>>>>>(Maybe it wasn't in '54. It's a lot more common now, I'm
sorry to say. The only reason it's not official SOP is because the Star
doesn't have enough mages to equip every fragging beat cop
with quickened-spell goodies.) <<<<<
-Thelma (06:33:41/01-22-57)
>>>>>(Beat cops can have this stuff too. The FRTers aren't the only
slots with mage friends. Sure, it's less common to find Joe Street
Grunt with increased reactions courtesy of a spell-but it happens.
I know-I ran into one once. He was so fragging fast, it was all I
could do to hold my own for a while. I hadn't expected him to be
that good, of course, which didn't help. Just dumb luck I didn't die
for my stupidity. Never, never underestimate your opponent, even
if he's just a beat cop.) <<<<<
-Been There (02:33:04/01-25-57)
Even with their magical toys, though, you can still take the
mundanes down. The secret, as always, is doing your homework
first. Find out what kind of protection the gunnies are likely to be
carrying and plan your response accordingly. You've heard a lot
through the grapevine lately about mundane troops with
increased reaction time? Then send your best razorboy or girl up
against him, or get a few of your biggest and meanest street
sammy friends to pile on him all at once. While he's busy duking
it out with them, get where you can see him and toss a chaos spell
or anything else localized that'll frag up the cop without hurting
your chummers.
One weird phenomenon I've run into a time or two is the
mundane cop with a spirit in tow. The mundane's mage buddy
whistles up a spirit for him back at the local HQ, then tells the spirit to do whatever the mundane says. If the mundane's got anything on the ball, he'll order the spirit to nail you to the best of its
ability-so be prepared to fight the spirit as well as the beat cop.

Luckily for the mundanes among us, a spirit has to manifest
in order to hit a non-magical target. So if it wants to hurt the
street samurai a few feet away, it has to get physical first. This
means that an alert runner with a sword or a knife or a club or
even a stun baton can hurt it, and can do a lot more damage
than the same weapon would do to a Lone Star trooper.
Harming the spirit this way is not an easy thing to do, but if
your will is strong enough you can do plenty of damage. No
guns, though (sorry, Mr. Street Sammy). Willpower is the only
thing that counts when you're fighting a manifest spirit, and the
laws of magic say that your SMG won't work because it's not
directly powered by your will.
>>>>>(That little quirk means that Samurai Bob can throw away his
Uzi III and fragging near destroy a manifest spirit using only his
cyberspurs. I saw someone do that once. We needed some extra
cybermuscle for a run, and on our fixer's recommendation hired
an absolutely crazed razorboy who called himself General
MacArthur Jones. The place we hit had a standing agreement
with Lone Star to send the FRT boys over, and they caught up to us
just as we were bugging out the back way. They were between us
and our wheels, so we had to stand and fight. Our mage was busy
tangling with one of the FRT wizboys-the other one called up a
fire elemental and told it to scrag us. We thought we were dead
for sure. Then Jonesy tosses away his guns, jumps out from behind
his cover, and runs straight at this flamin' thing with his cyberspurs
at the ready, giving a bloodcurdling rebel yell all the way. He tore
into it with the spurs agin and again and again, until the thing started screaming and then vanished. I'd never heard a spirit scream
before, and I hope never to hear that sound again. Jonesy came
out of it with singed eyebrows. Total nutcase, that man. Absolutely
flipped around the bend.) <<<<<
-Boris Badunov (05:20:03/01-24-57)
If the spirit in question is a nature spirit, meaning that it has
a defined domain, stepping out of its domain is a simple way to
render it harmless-say, ducking into an office building or someone's house to shake off a city spirit. (Pick an office building a little ways away from whatever disturbance you've been causingdashing into the lobby of the Renraku arcology when you've been
shooting up the pavement just outside is only trading one kind of
trouble for another.) Of course, this approach can also trap youthe minute you step outside again, you're toast, unless you deal
with the spirit in the meantime. Duck-and-cover works best when
combined with some other move, like banishing. Get away from
the spirit's domain so it can't do you any immediate damage, then
banish the thing at your leisure.
If you're a magician and you want to get fancy, you can whistle up a spirit of your own to fight your opponent, or you can try
to take control of the spirit. With that last tactic, keep in mind that
you're not wresting control away from the mundane trooper
you're taking it from the mage or shaman who called the spirit up.
If you've got juju to burn, go for it-if you win the contest, you
can use the spirit to kick the mundane trooper's hoop. Keep in
mind, though, that the mage you're going up against is probably
pretty strong; the Star is not noted for weaklings in its ranks. You'll
be feeling a lot of drain, even if you succeed. There's also the risk
of a draw, in which case the spirit becomes uncontrolled. It may
just go away, or it may keep trying to nail you because it didn't
appreciate you fragging around with it.
>>>>>(That happened to my chummer Laslo. He got control of a fire
elemental just for a second, then passed out from drain. The fire elemental was pissed cuz Laslo tried to dominate it-frag, I think it was
pissed at the whole world-and it engulfed him before any of us
could react. Wouldna done much good even if we coulda reacted
fast enough- bullets don't hurt a bonfire none. We got outta there
before the spirit could turn us into charcoal chunks, too.) <<<<<
-Muzzy (06:33:41/01-25-57)
Another thing to keep in mind when tangling with the Star on
the beat-he can and will call for magical backup the minute it starts
to look like he and his trusty Ruger Thunderbolt might not be able
to handle you. So tossing a wizzer spell at the street grunt just
because you can is not a smart move-it'll only bring an FRT team
down on you faster than you can say "nothing up my sleeve." Save
that kind of thing for situations where you need a weapon but you
can't pack heat. Then toss it and get out quick, or else be prepared
to fight some serious magic when the magecops show up.
>>>>>(The moral of the story is, never assume that the "regular
cop" is just a regular cop. I've had the misfortune to run into street
grunts on routine patrol who turned out to be drek-hot physical
adepts-a most unpleasant surprise. I survived the easiest way-I
cut and ran. Later, I indulged my curiosity about those oh-so-atypical patrol cops by paying a decker buddy to take a walk through
the Star's personnel files. Turns out the boyz-in-blue who nearly
cacked me had screwed up politically-brown-nosed the wrong
superior at a particularly unfortunate time-and got demoted to
patrol. If it happened to me twice, it can happen anytime and
anywhere.) <<<<<

THE DISEMBODIED FUZZ: ASTRAL PATROL COPS
"Magical backup" in Lone Star means more than the wizboys
and physads on the FRT and SWAT teams. It also means cops on
astral patrol. Luckily for shadowland, there just aren't enough
mages in the Star to allow for large numbers of cops to patrol
astral beats like they do the streets of Seattle (or anywhere else
they have a franchise). Unluckily, just about every Star precinct has
a few magecops whose sole duty is to hang around on the astral
waiting for a call.

it!) <<<<<

-Been There (01:22:31/01-26-57)
For the average group of shadowrunners, the existence of
astral patrol cops means that tossing spells around on the streets
is a mondo bad idea. The second some mundane copper spots
magical activity, he puts in a quick call to the precinct HQ, and the
resident magecops hotfoot it astrally to the site of the disturbance.
Astral bodies move fast; the astral backup will be on top of you and
doing damage before your brain finishes processing the information that Billy Beat Cop yelled for help. To make matters worse,
most of them bring a few spirits along for the party. This is the one
situation in which my advice is to run; unless you've got a whole
bunch of magicians who are all real quick on the uptake, you're
probably not going to be able to beat down a pair of talented
magecops plus their spirit buddies plus the mundane troopers who
are most likely still sending bullets your way. Scatter and fight
another day-and next time, don't get so flashy with your magic.
With magic as with everything else in this biz, the most effective
strategy is to minimize the trouble you get into in the first place.
>>>>>(Sound advice. But if you absolutely have to fight in this situation, there's a couple of things you can try. First, ditch any and all
foci or spell locks or anything else you may be packing that can
act as a link between the astral and physical planes. If there's no
link, astral spirits and spells can't do a fragging thing to hurt you.
The spirit can still nail you, but it has to manifest first-which means
you might get in some good licks. (Most spirits don't like to manifest for precisely that reason.) Second, if you're a drek-hot mage,
you can always go for broke with spirits of your own. (I don't even
want to think about the drain you'll suffer, but if you're this desperate ... what've you got to lose, eh?)
One last thing to remember, for all you folks out there shaking
in your shoes: this level of magical opposition is expensive and
rare. Odds are you won't face anything quite this bad, so breathe
easy.) <<<<<

CORPORATE MAGICIANS
by BizWatcher
Combat mages, security shamans, and physical adeptsthose are the three kinds of magic-slingers you're likely to meet
when you raid a corp site. (I'm assuming a relatively major corp,
even if it's not one of the Big Eight; most little mom-and-pop
corps can't afford to pay magically gifted personnel decently.
Magic-users don't come cheap.) A lot of the strategies Casper
mentioned in his piece work as well against corp wizards as
against Lone Star magecops. The trick is to know what kind of
opposition you'll be facing before you start your run, and plan
accordingly.

AZTECHNOLOGY
Of the Big Eight corps, Aztechnology and Saeder-Krupp have
the absolute best magical defenses, and that includes combat
magicians. Aztechnology is a particularly bad corp to tangle with
in this regard-as some of you may have read in the recent Aztlan
post, Aztechnology has about
twice the number of magically
active security personnel that
other corps have (including
Saeder-Krupp). In terms of raw
numbers, that may not sound like
much when you consider how
few magicians work in corp security-maybe one out of fifty Azzie
hardboys is a mage or a physad,
as opposed to one out of a hundred at Renraku. BUT ... and this
is an important "but" ... the
Azzies also have mojo to burn
making magical gewgaws for
their mundane sec-guards. The
mundanes can't sling spells or
throw spirits your way, but
they're amazingly tough to cut
down. Hell, they're tough even
to inconvenience. They've got all
the magical doodads Casper
talked about, and more-combined detect bullet/bullet barrier
spells, extended-range detect
enemies/acid bomb or fire bomb
spells, you name it. We're talking
nasty stuff-so if you're planning
on partying with Aztech security
forces, make sure you've got lots
of magic and plenty of ammo.
And make your planning airtight-no mistakes, or you'll likely end up dead. You'll need every
scrap of edge you can get just to
survive, let alone come out with
the paydata.
Just so you know what you're
up against, I'll describe for you a
run-in with a typical Azzie security
team that I had the misfortune to
meet during a run in the Az sector of Denver. My guess is you'll run
into slags like these at just about any Aztech facility. There were six
of them: two combat mages, a physical adept, and three mundane
razorboys. My cobbers and I did what we thought was the smart
thing; we booked down the hall and around a couple of corners,
dodging magic and bullets all the way, then split up so we could
take on the sec-boys from different directions. (We'd sussed the layout of the place pretty thoroughly beforehand, so we knew which
corridors led to what.) We figured to take on the cyberboys first,
since they were the weakest link.
Three of us-me, Lizard and McGarrity-managed to come
up behind the razors. One of them had a spatial recognizer, so he
knew where we were before his chummers did, but we'd figured
on that. Brought our longest-range guns plus a couple of crossbows-Lizard loves 'em, she's the only person I know who can
fire two at once. Anyway, the
cyberboys spun around with
their guns up just as we opened
fire. They were a second too
late, just like we'd planned-we
let the APDS fly and waited for
our targets to explode.
We got our explosion, all
right-about ten feet short of
the cyberguards. Turns out they
were carrying quickened detect
bullet/bullet barrier and detect
explosives/blast barrier spells.
Silly us; we'd figured they
wouldn't have any magical protection because they were so
heavily cybered. Cyber frags up
magic, right? So a razorboy
can't use magic, right? Wrong.
Well, okay, technically rightbut dead wrong in this situation.
See, we forgot one crucial facta mundane razorboy carrying a
quickened spell isn't actually
using magic. His mage buddy's
the one who whipped up the
spell. So the razorboy's cyber
doesn't frag up a thing-except
us, of course. We stood there
and gaped for a few precious
milliseconds when we should
have been beating feet. One of
the cyberboys' guns coughed.
and McGarrity went down in a
fountain of blood. Lizard and I
ran. We skidded around a corner, and Lizard ducked back just
long enough to fire a crossbow
bolt at the razors. Went right
through his throat, as sweet a
shot as I've ever seen: apparently his detect bullet spell didn't work against other projectiles.
That was our only piece of luck. The rest of the team wasn't
doing too well against the physad and the two mages. The
mages worked as a team, taking turns throwing mana bolts and
powerballs. Our mage, Cindy Moon, tossed up a mana barrier,
but sustaining the thing was costing her big-time. Finally it collapsed, and so did she. Went down for the count, leaving Cyber
Charlie and poor old Rat to guard her with nothing more than
machine guns and wired reflexes. Rat fired once at the physad,
who sidestepped the entire spray of slugs. Charlie let off some
rounds at the Azzie mages, just for something to do-he had to
know the bullets would never reach their targets. The Azzie wizboys didn't miss a beat-they each flung a powerball, one at Rat
and Charlie and one at Cindy. Charlie's wires paid off; he threw
himself out of the line of fire, getting his hair singed in the
process. The spells burned Cindy good, and threw Rat so hard
into the wall that I could hear his neck snap. That's one thing
about the Azzies-they don't care if you're already down, they'll
kill you just for the frag of it.
Meanwhile, the physad hung back and watched the show.
Lizard and I went for him, figuring he might be distracted
enough by the magical fireworks for us to plug him. He wasn't.
He flashed up right next to Lizard, so fragging fast I swear he
practically teleported. Before she could take even a step away,
he'd grabbed her still-loaded crossbow and shot her in the chest
with it. Then he looked at me, like a butcher figuring out just
how to slice up a side of beef. I tossed a knife at him, and he
caught it like I'd lobbed him an easy fly ball. I lost it then-broke
and ran. Some time later, I realized that Charlie was running
right beside me. Wheels was waiting with the truck and didn't
say a word when he saw us-just gunned the motor and took
off. Why the Azzie hardboys didn't come after us and finish us
off, I'll never know-maybe we weren't worth the trouble or
something. Call me crazy, but somehow I don't exactly feel
grateful.
So now you know what kind of trouble you're in for if you
tackle an Azzie security team. And remember-the wonderful
folks I just described are your average security. I hate to think of
what's waiting for anybody who tries to crack into a really sensitive Aztech lab.
>>>>>(Well, whaddaya expect if you're dumb enough to take the
Azzies head-on? You don't do that unless you've got a fragging
army at your disposal. Me. I like the subtle approach. Assense the
place from a ways off, map out where the magically active personnel are and how they're moving, and then send in a watcher
or two to find whatever it is you're after. Tell the watcher the exact
route to follow, but also tell it that any orders you give it to change
directions supersede the preplanned route. Then keep an astral
eye on it as it goes through the installation, and make sure it stays
well away from the corp mages. Once it's found the stuff you
want, call it back and plan your strategy for getting the prize. A
friend of mine has an ally spirit that he sends in on fetch-and-carry
missions; the ally goes in astrally, dodges the sec-mages and
watchers, manifests physically to get whatever he's after, and
then walks out while my friend and some samurai chummers are
raising holy hell at the gate. Works like a charm.) <<<<<

got past the security team easy. Before we went in, our shaman
cast spells on all of us with cyber to increase our reaction time,
because we figured we'd need it to deal with the Azzie razors and
any physads they happened to have. She also set up a wiz chaotic world spell, anchored to our lead samurai's body armor and
linked to a detect enemies spell so that the chaotic world would
go off as soon as the security team showed up. We snuck into the
place with a little help from our rigger, and everything went
according to plan. The Azzie team we ran into had two mages
and two physads, but all of them succumbed to the chaotic world
spell for long enough to let us charge past them. We'd been practicing our strategy for weeks, having our mage cast chaotic world
on us so's we could fight off its effects-which is exactly what we
did. One of the physads recovered quickly enough to toss a couple of throwing stars our way, and caught Cannonball in the shoulder-but Cannonball's a troll, and even though he's slow he's
fragging hard to take down. Cannonball just kept moving, like he
didn't feel a thing. Maybe he didn't. Anyway, we booked real
quick down the hall, and as we rounded the first corner I played
our last trump card-I dropped a little pendant, a piece of
scrimshaw carved in the shape of a walrus. Just the kind of thing
that might be a talisman, y'know? Well, one of the mundane
razorboys got to the cross corridor first and started to pick up the
pendant. An Azzie mage saw him and yelled at him not to touch
it, but it was too late. As soon as the razorboy's hand touched the
scrimshaw, the stink spell anchored to it went off. We were already
out of the spell's range, so I don't know exactly what happenedbut no Azzie mages came roaring after us right away, so it must
have worked pretty good. By the time the hardboys' guts stopped
heaving, they'd lost track of us-and we made sure to stay good
and lost until we got what we came for and got out of
there.) <<<<<
-Crow (00:01:34/01-19-57)
SAEDER-KRUPP
Saeder-Krupp is another fun one to tangle with. They don't
have as many magically active personnel as Aztechnology, but
they integrate them real well with the regular security, and you
can bet there's one mean combat mage assigned to practically
every guard patrol. The best thing I can say about Saeder-Krupp
security teams is that at least their mages rarely work in pairs-in
order to have enough to go around, they have to spread 'em
pretty thin. However, plenty of Saeder-Krupp's combat mages
work in tandem with paracritters. Hell hounds seem to be the
favorite; they can do lots of damage with their flaming breath, and
they don't have many weaknesses to exploit.
One of the few magical tactics that I've seen work against hell
hounds and other paracritters is to toss a control animal spell on
them. With hell hounds, you've gotta make it a strong onethey're smart critters, and the smarter ones are harder to snare
this way. But it can be done, and it slots up the combat mage to
no end. Most of 'em can't resist trying to take back control of their
little pet, which means that they're not paying full attention to
magically scragging you. Take advantage of the distraction-toss
a spell their way, or get your samurai buddies to lob a grenade
over. Better yet, set the hell hound on them. The hound's not
gonna go for their throat, of course-control or no control, you
can't make the beastie kill the guy whose spent months or years
feeding it and training it. But you can turn that hell hound into one
mighty inconvenient lap doggie. Tell it to love Its handler like
crazy. It'll jump up and down in front of him, lick his face, beg to
be petted, playfully knock him down ... all very useful ways of
keeping the combat mage off balance.
>>>>>(You can use paranimals against paranimals, too. A friend
of mine has a trained flock of birdmen, about ten of 'em, that he
takes on runs whenever there's a good chance of running into
paranormal watch-beasts. We hit a Saeder-Krupp lab outside
New York City, and Vlad-that's my buddy, Vlad Tepes-brought
the birdmen along because we knew the place was guarded by
hell hounds with handlers who were serious combat mages. While
we snuck toward the perimeter fence, watching the guard patrols
go by, our decker cracked into the security system and killed the
lights. We were about twenty yards away when we saw the lights
go. Right on cue, Vlad released his little bird-bats, who flew
straight for the patrol shrieking like gangbusters. The noise drove
the hell hounds nuts-they started running every which way, flaming things at random out of sheer panic. The mage handler couldn't calm them down-they fragging near flamed him to death
when he tried. He yelled for help, and half a dozen guard patrols
came a-running to put down the crazed doggies. They didn't
want to kill them-trained hell hounds are expensive to replace !so nearly every combat mage in the place ended up in the front
yard, throwing spells to contain the hell puppies. A bunch of mundanes came with them, ready to shoot if the doggies started
going for the wizboys (who are also expensive to replace). With so
many of the security personnel so nicely distracted, we strolled
through a little side gate that our decker friend had obligingly
unlocked, and got in and out with what we came for.) <<<<<

OTHER CORPS
Don't get the idea that the other six megacorps-or any other
corporation with any kind of serious money-is some kind of magical pushover. Aztechnology and Saeder-Krupp may be the leaders
of this particular pack, but all the big corps know how to play nasty
when it comes to magic. Of the rest, Fuchi and Renraku are the closest to being "weak" on magical security; in Fuchi's case because
most of the folks running it are mundanes who don't think about
magic as much as they should, and in Renraku's case because of the
sheer variation in security measures from site to site.
If you're after some kind of paydata from Fuchi, using magic
to get in may be a good tactical move. Fuchi's prime product is its
software, and they invest an awful lot of nuyen in Matrix defenses
because that's where they expect the toughest attacks to come
from. They've got decent physical security, too-Fuchi scientists
are prime targets for extractions, which means that the bodies'll be
coming over the wall. Magical assaults, though, they don't
expect-or at least, not as much. They've gotten better about it in
recent years, but they still tend to treat magical protection as an
afterthought. I've managed to sneak in and out of Fuchi installations using improved invisibility, tagging in at the end of the nightshift crowd so that the sounds of their passage would cover mine
(and slipping real fast through closing doors). If you use this tactic,
though, make sure to avoid walking over pressure sensors-your
body weight isn't invisible, and you will trigger an alarm.
A decker chummer of mine once used the invisibility dodge
to set up a nice back door into the local matrix system at a little
Fuchi lab (and no, I won't tell you where). She had me cast
improved invisibility on her, then marched in at the end of the late
shift. The lab was working on a rush project, and they'd been bringing in lots of outside consultants-so when the spell wore off.
nobody thought twice about seeing an unfamiliar face in a nicely
cut suit working over at an empty terminal. It took her all night to
set up the back door, and she left at the end of the shift. I'd set up
a mask spell on a coral pinky ring she liked to wear, and so the
minute she slipped the ring on she looked just like the legit consultant who'd fallen mysteriously ill that day, but hadn't managed
to call in (heh-heh). The desk guard was bored and tired and hungry-he looked at my chummer, saw a somewhat familiar face, and
waved her out. Sneaky but simple, the whole operation-no guns
blazing, no fireball spells or other bulldozer-type stuff. Just a little
subtle magic, crafted to fit the circumstances, so that my chummer
could get in and do what she was best at. That's the best way to
use magic, as far as I'm concerned. Forget about the frontal assault,
especially if you're likely to go toe-to-toe with tough combat
mages and magically augmented cyberboys loaded for bear. Why
take on that kind of opposition unless you have to? Look for your
target's weaknesses instead, and use your magic to exploit them.

nailed two of us before we got him. We closed around our mage,

whipped up a fire bolt spell, and we stepped aside just long

adepts to one-on-one combat, while the rest of our team and the

that no one interfered. The Jaguars are a pretty machismo
bunch-backing down from a challenge like that, especially one
offered by a half-gringo female, was more than they could take,
and they went for it. As soon as all three activated their weapon

the world as Paladins. According to the research I'd done before
embarking on this little escapade, most Paladins are either physical adepts or cyberboys, but a few are combat mages. I had the
luck (?) to meet a combat mage whose ceremonial armor contained an immense number of spell locks built into its ornamentation. His combat sense was phenomenally heightened, and he
had locked-in barrier spells against almost every kind of weapon
(including the brace of spells I had intended to cast on him, of
course). My ally spirit, bless its heart, saved my hide-left to my
own efforts I'd have died a terrible death. My ally used its formidable powers against the Paladin from astral space, engaging
enough of his attention that he failed to notice the near end of
the large park bench looming toward him until it was too late to
dodge. The bench hit him on the neck-that's the weak spot in
most plate armor, between the helmet and the back plate. He
went down like a stack of cards. My telekinetic manipulation
failed to break his neck, but wrought iron makes an amazingly
effective club.) <<<<<

>>>>>(Most of us shadowfolk don't have to worry about the
Paladins-we'll never have occasion to meet them. The ones to
worry on are the Ghosts-aka the Special Forces troops of Tir
Tairngire. These scary fraggers are physical adept initiates, every
last fragging one of them-and they are everywhere you want to
be (if you're in biz, of course). That last is what makes them so dangerous. I don't care about the big nasty armed-to-the-teeth-andmagically-invulnerable slot who guards Lord High Muckety-Muck's
butt, cuz I'm not planning on getting close to His Lordship-ergo,
Mr. Big Bad Bogeyman will never be a threat to me. But the
Special Forces slag acting as "on-site security consultant" to the
top-secret corp installation that my Johnson's paying me
meganuyen to sleaze into-him, I care about. He's gonna get in
my way unless I can figure how to blow through him or sneak
around him. And when you're dealing with people like the Ghosts,
neither one is easy.
I managed it once, though. I'd gotten in and out of where I
was supposed to go, encountering just about the level of opposition I'd expected-which should have warned me. My buds and
I were coasting away in our "borrowed" catering truck, congratulating ourselves on how well we'd coped with all the drek we'd
anticipated, when suddenly I had this feeling that someone was
watching us from somewhere. Almost as soon as I recognized the
feeling, it vanished-but I've been in this biz too long to discount
the sneaking little hunches you sometimes get. So I told my buds
about it, and the three of us decided not to head for our rendezvous point yet. Instead, we'd drive around awhile and see if
we could make our tail (if there was one) pop his head up from
cover.
Well, we drove around for almost two hours, stopping for gas
and stuffers and even a quick drink at a bar, but nothing happened except I got that prickles-at-the-back-of-your-neck feeling
once or twice. We'd just about decided that for once my "hunch"
was paranoia, when the Nightsky a few cars in front of us pulled a
boneheaded move-he stopped dead about a meter from the
intersection, then threw the car across two lanes of oncoming traffic to get to the turn lane. We didn't crash, but the resulting pileup
stopped us cold. Godot, our rigger, got out of the truck to scope
the situation and see if there was a clear path out of the jam, and
that's when the Ghost struck. He just appeared out of nowhere
right next to poor Godot and slammed him into the truck hood.
Cracked his skull, I think. Jake brought his gun up right quick, then
gave a yell and swung it around as a throwing star came flying at
him. Lucky for Jake he's got good reflexes-the barrel of his FNHAR sent the star spinning into the side of an armored car.
By this time, the Ghost's two cyberboy friends had piled out of
a nearby vehicle and were sending rounds our way. Jake and I
both ducked behind the truck and used the cover of the traffic
jam to crawl away in opposite directions. I took a quick peek into
the astral, saw that the razorboys were real close to the Ghost,
and that Jake had crawled right next to a cab with its engine running that was a quick three-pointer away from a Stuffer Shack
entryway. Hoping he'd pick up on the game plan, I made my
move. Cast a beautiful ice sheet spell toward the Ghost and his
friends, then sprinted toward Jake. The Ghost went down-I guess
he'd been scanning the astral for me, so he was distracted. Even
a physad's phenomenal reflexes can't keep him on his feet when
too large a chunk of his consciousness is thinking about something
else. He recovered pretty quick, but Jake managed to pull the
cab around and shoot us outta there. Coupla slugs went through
the back window, and I thanked the spirits for the detect bullet/bullet barrier spell locks I'd set up just a few days ago. (The
cabbie was pretty snarked off about the bullet holes, so Jake
shoved a credstick in his mouth and told him he could keep it if he
shut up, He did.)
Jake and I were lucky, of course-we were only facing one
Ghost and a couple of mundy cyberboys, not the usual six-man
Special Forces unit. My guess is, the one we tangled with was supposed to keep us under surveillance until we'd led him to our rendezvous, at which point a whole bunch more Ghosts and gunnies
would've turned up to nail the big fish. Maybe our friend figured
we'd gotten wise to him and took a chance where he saw it, or
maybe he just wanted to grab a little glory by nabbing us singlehandedly (or close to it, anyway). Whatever, he moved too soon,
and Jake and I took advantage of the situation. Which brings me
to a very important lesson, especially when you're dealing with
major pains in the magical hoop. Planning is all well and goodit's essential, in fact. But improvisation has its uses as well. It's not
enough just to have a well-written playbook-you've also got to
know when to throw it away, cuz there's always going to be something that catches you by surprise.) <<<<<

war stories didn't make it. I had to delete about 11.8 Mp, because
we're running out of room. As far as getting useful info out of this
goes, though, you're not missing much. Turns out almost all the
posts in this little free-for-all talked about fighting the boys and girls
of the Big A, the elf Paladins, and the Ghosts. (Just goes to show
who the toughest are, I guess.)
I wanted to drop a note on another bunch of magic-heavy
security slags you may run up against. Hardly anyone mentioned
them, and I don't know why. I'm guessing either they're so tough
that no one's survived to tell the tale (I doubt that) or they ain't
protecting anything worth any real nuyen at the moment (much
more likely). I'm talking about the Sioux Wildcats, who are just as
tough as anything the Big A or the elves can toss at you. I've heard
that the Sioux Special Forces test the physads who want to be
Wildcats by blinding them and dropping them off in the wilderness. If they survive, they're in-if not, they're vulture food. So
when I say these slots are tough, I mean they're tough.
Two things to keep in mind about the Wildcats. First, if you're
facing off against them, you're almost always on their territory.
which gives them the old home-field advantage. They probably
know the ground a lot better than you do, so be prepared for that.
Second, most likely they have shamans backing them up rather
than hermetic mages. The shamans can call on different kinds of
spirits (as we've talked about in various other posts), and they can
make your life hell-especially if your idea of the Great Outdoors
is having a beer on the roof of your tenement. I hear a favorite
tactic among Wildcat units is to have a shaman summon a spirit
of the sky and make it turn to fog so the physads can pick you off
one by one under its cover.
As regards dealing with all the various folks who are major
magical bad news (in law enforcement or otherwise), everybody's stories came down to three basic tactics:
1. Blow the hell out of the bad guys head to head. (If only it
was that easy!)
2. Sneak past them. (Planning! Planning! Planning!)
3. Psyche them out. (Hope it works!)
And what these three boil down to is planning-the kind of
planning you can only do yourself. Don't trust what the Johnson
tells you about the security setup. You need to observe, learn, figure out everything. Plan the run out to the bitter end, but remember to leave yourself some openings-if the drek hits the fan, you
need to have backup options. Finally, if you suspect that you may
have to deal with these walking magical death traps, make sure
your magic is bigger, badder, and tougher. I know (better than
most) that magic doesn't grow on trees-you can't just go down
to the nearest mage recruitment office and pick up a handful of
new chummers. That means you need to get to know people who
can sling spells, so you'll have someone to call on when you need
it. If you need a bigger gun, you buy one. If you need bigger
magic, you better buy someone who can provide it. If that means
sharing the pot with some new guy, so be it. Nuyen ain't no good
if your carcass is smoked to a pile of ashes.
See you on the streets.) <<<<<

MAGICAL THREATS
>>>>>[I hope this peek into the wonderful world of modern magic
taught you all a bit about how to protect yourself against what's
out there-or at least survive it. Somehow, it all seems almost manageable once you know what you're up against, doesn't it? Well,
before you answer that question, maybe you'd better scan this
post, because I've saved the worst for last. Toxic and insect spirits,
vampires, wendigos, shapeshifters-the nastiest, most dangerous
things the Awakening has spawned. Some of these threats really
have it in for the rest of us-they're mean, malevolent and thirsty
for our blood. Others are more alien than evil-we can't figure
their plans because they don't think like any (meta)human does,
but what they're plotting sure ain't for the good of the population.

TOXIC SPIRITS AND SHAMANS
Throughout history, the inquisitive minds of men have produced strange and wondrous technologies. Often, these technologies have been harnessed to benefit mankind and the creatures of the world. But just as often, these technologies have produced harmful effects that none could have foreseen, for throughout history man's technological grasp has often exceeded his wisdom. His arrogance blinds him to the laws of nature, and he too
often believes that he can bend the natural world to his will. In
these instances, mankind's technologies may bring destruction,
decay, pain, suffering and death-both to himself and to the rest
of the world. Toxic shamans and toxic spirits are a by-product of
these blunderings, mutations spawned from the polluted rivers
and poisoned woods.
>>>>>(Fool! Blind man! Open your eyes. Toxic spirits are no mere
mutations of the natural order. These beings are Nature's revenge

Perhaps the most disturbing manifestations of (meta)humanity's depradations are the toxic mutations of the Spirits of Man.
These arise in domains where misery, poverty, cruelty, regimentation, repression and the denial of life reduce people to hopelessness.
All toxic spirits are easily recognized by their twisted, crippled-looking appearance in astral space. These beings are particularly dangerous because they possess all the powers of free spirits, plus they may travel outside of their domains at the orders of
their summoning shamans.

Magic gave life and form to the twisted results of man's arrogant attitude toward his environment. Just as the nature totems
speak to those who become shamans, so the twisted totems call
to magically capable (meta)humans and create toxic shamans. The
most widely accepted theory labels toxic shamans as crazy,
though whether driven so by the toxic spirits or driven by madness to become toxic shamans remains undetermined.
In keeping with man's perpetual efforts to harness nature's
most powerful forces, some toxic shamans believe it is their destiny to call toxic spirits and use them to avenge what they see as
the defilement of the earth. Others summon toxic spirits and order
them to further spread the corruption of the domain from which
they arise, believing that only by eradicating man from the earth
will Gaia be saved.

ferocious destroyer of humanity. The toxic Dog seeks the death of
those the healthy Dog would protect.) <<<<<
-Argos (10:34:48/01-14-57)
The characteristic all toxic shamans share is a complete lack
of compassion. Regardless of how reasonably they may justify
their actions, you cannot predict their reactions to a threat or situation using the yardstick of normal (meta)human behavior. Toxic
shamans dabble with absolute power, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
>>>>>(Cut to the chase, buddy. Platitudes and homilies aren't

-Sera-Sera (20:23:42/01-15-57)
Toxic spirits possess all the powers of healthy nature spirits,
which, as you might guess, makes it almost impossible for
(meta)humanity to coexist with free toxic spirits. Toxic spirits and
shamans must be dealt with in the same ways as healthy nature spirits and shamans. Because I have never heard of a toxic shaman successfully undergoing rehabilitation, I must recommend that they be
put to death. Toxic spirits can be banished, disrupted or destroyed in
the usual fashions, but never controlled in any long-term way.
However acceptable their reasons for certain actions, toxic shamans
and spirits will eventually step over a line that sane people are not
prepared to cross-and then, without question or hesitation, they
must be dealt with in the most ruthless way conceivable.
>>>>>(Whew! I think this guy must be a direct descendant of the
man who hunted Count Dracula! Ordinarily I don't cotton much
to extremists, but I've seen the work of toxics and Dr. Van Helsing's
attitude is right on the money. I cheered for the spirit that rose from
the Calumet toxic swamp when it destroyed the factories dumping pollutants into the water, and I even thought it was justified in
razing the land for 100 yards around the swamp. But I guess it was
just blind luck that it destroyed the factories when they were shut
down for the weekend. because it soon started killing the people
who worked in the factories, the owners, and the families of men
who had historically owned industrial works on that property. Then
it went for banks that had loaned money to the owners, companies that sold the factories everything from office supplies to raw
materials, and it got worse from there. The shaman controlling this
spirit really did his homework.
Though many shamans sent spirits against the toxic, the toxic
always won-probably through sheer orneriness. The rampage
ended in a really spectacular battle, lots of colors and lights and
explosions shooting up from the depths of the swamp. The toxic
was finally destroyed by what we later learned was a free spirit.
The trouble is, of course, that no one knows why the free spirit
stepped in. Maybe it had its own plans for the area. All we could
do was hope its goals were less destructive than the toxic's.) <<<<<

INSECT SPIRITS AND SHAMANS
Let's move on to another, equally dangerous magical
threat-insect spirits and shamans.
Ants, flies, termites, wasps, roaches, mantids-these are the
insect totems. No one really knows where they come from, no
one can really explain their existence or their goals. But nearly
everyone (except for the shamans of these totems) agrees that
these strange totems are very, very dangerous. Of all the generally harmful totems, the insect totems target their activities most
obviously and relentlessly against (meta)humanity.
Generally, insect shamans believe they can use an insect
totem for their own gain when they first accept the totem's guidance. When you consider the vast power these totems wield, the
temptation is easily understood. In all cases, however, the alien
nature of the totem eventually emerges and becomes ascendent,
and the totem ends up using the shaman for its own ends.
>>>>>(Hey, I gotta question. How is it that all the bad guys are
shamans? If you believe this post, the nature boys are responsible
for raising all the nasty stuff in the world. Anybody ever hear of a
hermetic gone wrong?) <<<<<
-Sera-Sera (18:34:52/01-23-57)
>>>>>(Sure. Plenty of mages take advantage of their power to do
the dirty to the rest of the world. As has been said many times,
many ways, magic is neither inherently good or evil. Magic simply
is, and (meta)humanity uses it properly or twists it, according to its
nature.
That basic fact provides the key to why shamans come off on
the wrong end of the stick more often than mages when the talk
centers on evil magic. Totems call their shamans, almost always
according to their nature. Dog would not call to someone who harbors a deep, abiding fear of dogs. Eagle would not call to a magic
user with a crippling fear of heights. So it stands to reason that
shamans who accept the toxic totems already live in a world filled
with hate and fear and the thirst for revenge. Shamans who follow
the insect totems carry an overwhelming and undeniable lust for
power and influence. If the world offered no magical power, these
poor slubs would find another way to satisfy their demons.
In my opinion, the logical conclusion to this argument must
be that hermetic mages who turn to evil are even more despicable than shamans who twist their magic. For while shamans may
lay part of the blame for their actions on the totems that influence
them, hermetics have no such convenient excuse. They must
shoulder full responsibility for their deeds.) <<<<<

Our verifiable knowledge of the insect spirits and totems is
quite sketchy, too much so for
real comfort. The recent incident
in Chicago, the shake-up within
the Universal Brotherhood, the
Crashcart debacle-all these
events increased our store of
facts regarding the insect spirits,
but much remains to be learned.
We can, however, state several
accurate generalizations. There
are, apparently, two categories
of insect spirits: hive-based
(such as ant, fly and wasp) and
solitary (primarily roach and
mantid). We also know that all
insect spirits take one of two
forms-flesh form or true form.
The appearance of flesh-form
insect spirits varies widely, from
bizarre hybrids of insect and
(meta)human forms to successful merges that leave the
(meta)human form unmarked.
(In the case of spirit-(meta)
human merges that leave the
flesh body intact, only an astral
assensing of the "person's" aura
will reveal the nature of the
hybrid.) True-form insect spirits
resemble the totem insect but
are human-sized.

-Bug Hunter (21:12:04/01-31-57)
All hives are centered around queen spirits, highly intelligent
and deadly beings. The queen offers a conduit of totem power for
insect shamans and also has the power to create new insect spirits herself. The queen's sole purpose is to strengthen the nest by
obtaining human hosts to carry new insect spirits and so to secure
territory for the hive. Queens may use brute force to achieve their
goals, or more subtle means.
Hives are the most difficult insect manifestation to eradicate.
Because we lack complete knowledge of the insect spirit nature,
it remains impossible for us to determine how to erase them from
our world. As Chicago proved, even the UCAS, supported by the
corps and informed by the magical community, could find no
more satisfactory solution to destroying the hive at the city's center than to detonate a nuclear device within the nest. This
response did not kill all the bug spirits, and we can only assume
that the explosion killed the nest's queen, for we have no real evidence to support that assumption.
Solitary insect spirits include roach and mantid spirits. The
females of these bugs can reproduce on their own, so an insect
shaman need only summon one female to spawn an entire generation of bug spirits.

-X-terminator (21:09:44/02-01-57)
Mantid spirits break the few rules we accept as true about
other insect spirits. Emerging mantid spirits do not incubate in
human hosts, but must be invested into a (meta)human host of
the same gender. Rather than focusing their efforts on destroying
(meta)humankind, mantid spirits feed on other insect spirits. And
because female mantid spirits always manifest as flesh-form spirits that show no sign of their insect form, and can continue to
function as the person the host used to be, mantid spirits show a
decided preference for living among humans.
Though these characteristics seem to indicate that mantids
and (meta)humans might make suitable allies against the threat
other insect spirits present, mantids show no particular affection
for humans, and in fact ruthlessly dispose of those humans who
purposefully or inadvertently interfere with their unknowable
plans.

You'll notice I used the word "other" in that sentence, implying
that the infected belong to the same races as you and I. Now, I
know a general statement like that will stir up some flak, but the
scientific community feels statistically confident that the five types
of entities I listed above are (in order) humans, orks, dwarfs, trolls
and elves infected with some strain of the HMHVV, the HumanMetahuman Vampiric Virus.
If they're just a variation on the standard theme, you ask, then
why put them under magical threats? Perhaps you failed to grasp
the full implications of "creatures that drain the life force from
other (meta)humans to live." I don't know about you, but I can
think of cleaner ways to die than by having the essence of my
being sucked away by some ugly, amoral son-of-a-slitch that used

bury itself in the chaos of Berlin. After a couple of weeks, I picked up
its trail when it surfaced in a vid report of an attack by the ORC policlub against a mid-sized family-owned business, and ran it to
ground in a goblin lair on the south edge of the walled city. To make
a long story short, the goblins worked together like a well-oiled
machine to defend their territory and the deequa led the assault
with frightening efficiency. They effectively repulsed everything but
my stonk of concussion mini-grenades-I walked in, trussed the deequa and rolled him out like taking candy from a baby.

A shapeshifter can be one of the most cunning adversaries you'll ever face. Because they're animals first, they've
got very strong survival and hunting instincts. Okay, you say,
so shapeshifters are animals with instincts, so fraggin' what.
Well, instincts are like reflexes-they're automatic. A tiger
doesn't have to think about how he's gonna bring down his
dinner. He already knows what's good to eat and he knows
how to catch it. Killing is an instinct: he's born knowing how to
do it. And that instinct makes him fast-faster than any unaugmented human.
And because shapeshifters are animals following their
instincts, they're not likely to be troubled by any moral qualms or
human weaknesses when the drek hits the fan. You can see how
that's a tricky call whether you're working with one or facing off

above the site of a factory that used to manufacture buttons
(not that I think that fact has anything to do with my story) and
that a couple of go-gangs now use as a headquarters. I was
doing a little astral surveillance one day for a Mr. Johnson of
my acquaintance, and I ran into this shapeless, shifting mass in
astral space. I was instantly ready to fight, but it didn't seem all
that interested in me. There were two small spheres floating
toward the top of the mass that I assumed served as the
thing's eyes, for lack of a better word, that turned briefly
toward me and then back to the astral version of the factory.
Everything there was mundane except for two gangers carrying spell locks of some sort. One of those two was working on
a Rapier, the other was leaning against the wall nodding his
head in time to the thrash blasting from huge speakers hung
from the catwalks.
I was a little leery of the blob, so I kept my distance and waited to see what it was up to. As I watched. the blob snaked out a
tiny tendril of itself and touched the spell lock of the ganger leaning against the wall. The moment the tendril connected, the
ganger folded to the floor and his aura blanked out. I flashed my
glance to the blob and held off on the hellblast I'd whipped up to
off this murderer-the critter had gone translucent and flattened
to a hairline, the spheres flashing alternately blue and red. Far as I
could tell, it was upset, even frightened.
I looked back at the factory. All the gangers were gathered
around their dead companion except for the slub working on the
bike, and he kept looking over his shoulder at the other gangers,
his hands full of parts that he apparently couldn't drop. Too late I
noticed another tendril just as it touched the spell lock on the second ganger's body, and he also died instantly. Unfortunately,
when he fell something sparked and lit off the fuel in the bike's
tank, which exploded, killing the rest of the gangers with flying
shrapnel. I looked back at the blob.
This time its entire mass was flashing between colors. As I
watched, the flat version of its body rapidly folded in on itself like
origami until all that was left was the two spheres and a triangle.
Then they blinked out of existence.
It all happened pretty fast, but I got the distinct feeling this
entity didn't intend to hurt the gangers-it was just experimenting
with its surroundings, just like a kid. I gotta say I regret not killing the
blob, even though it wasn't hostile. Harm is harm, however well
intentioned.) <<<<<

This section provides expansions and clarifications to the rules presented in Shadowrun,
Second Edition (SRII) and The Grimoire, Second Edition (Grimoire II). New rules for voudoun
and other, previously unexplored magical concepts also appear in this section. As always,
these rules are optional. The gamemaster should give these rules careful consideration to
determine whether or not they will mesh with his group's gaming style or unbalance his game
before incorporating any or all of them into a new or existing campaign.
MAGICAL SKILLS
Magical skills represent a character's knowledge and training in magical theory, conjuring,
sorcery and enchanting. The following section offers clarifications, optional rules and mundane
uses for magical skills.
SKILL DEFAULTS
As with other skills, it is possible to default magical skills through the Skill Web (p. 68,
SRII). Sorcery, Conjuring and Enchanting all default to Magic Theory as well as to each other
(it is possible for a theoretical thaumaturgist to attempt some practical applications of magic,
but he's not likely to be very good at it). Magical skills can also default to the Willpower
Attribute. Adepts and even mundanes can also make use of magical skill defaults-even if they
cannot use the applicable skill to perform magic, they can make various non-magical tests. For
example, a mundane who learns a free spirit's true name can default to Willpower to make a
Conjuring Test and attempt to control that spirit (though he is far better off spending the time
and Karma learning Conjuring if he really wants to succeed!). As always when using the Skill
Web, add 2 to the skill test target number for each dot crossed on the Web.

RULES
Psychometry
(Aura Reading)
Magical Theory

WILLPOWER
Enchanting
Sorcery
MUNDANES AND MAGICAL SKILLS
Though nearly all characters can use any skill on the Skill Web,
a character must be magically active (i.e., have a Magic Attribute
of 1 or greater) in order to use magical skills. The characters who
use magical skills most effectively are the true magicians (human
characters with Priority A allocated to Magic or metahuman characters with Priority B allocated to magic). Magical skills can be differentiated between active use, that is, using the skill to perform
magic, and mundane use, using the skill for non-magical purposes (that may affect magic in some indirect way).
The descriptions below note which areas of the skill are considered mundane and can be used by non-magician characters as
well as magical adepts with no capabilities for that skill.
MAGICAL THEORY
The Magical Theory Skill gives a character a body of knowledge about the basic unifying principles of magic. That theoretical
body of knowledge supports the more practical skills of Sorcery,
Conjuring and Enchanting.
Mundane Use: Even a mundane who cannot wield any kind
of active magic can gain a complete understanding of the principles and theories behind magic, though few possess the dedication to do so without at least some Talent. Those mundanes who
persevere in their pursuit of magical knowledge often make excellent theorists.
Concentrations and Specializations
History: The History Concentration covers the general history
of magical thought and traditions, including all major periods in
human history and the individual theories of magic peculiar to
each period. Characters might focus their studies on the movements and eras that particularly influenced modern magical theory, such as nineteenth century England and the early Americas.
Magical Theory can be further Specialized by either geographic
area (European, North American and so on) or historical period
(the Renaissance, the Great Ghost Dance).
Spell Design: The Spell Design Concentration allows characters
to create new spell formulae by which they may channel the energies of astral space in a particular way to create a particular effect.
Even mundane theorists or adepts lacking full use of the Sorcery Skill
can design spells, though they are unable to cast them. Spells cannot
be taught, however, without active use of magic; if a magician wants
to learn a spell designed by a mundane theorist, he must puzzle out
the casting on his own. Spell Design can be further Specialized by
magical tradition (hermetic, shamanic and so on). Characters of one
tradition who try to learn a spell formula from another tradition must
add 2 to the target number for learning the formula.
Tradition: The Tradition Concentration focuses on a particular
magical tradition: hermetic, shamanic, voudoun, druidic and so
on. Each of the major magical traditions outlined in published
Shadowrun products counts as a separate Concentration. The
gamemaster may wish to further Specialize these traditions (e.g.,
English Druidry, Native American Shamanism, Post-Modern
Hermeticism and so on).
Parapsychology: The Parapsychology Concentration of the
Magical Theory Skill involves the study of nineteenth- and twentieth-century theories of "psychic" or paranormal abilities based on
a conventional scientific model. Most of the Information in this
magical discipline offers no practical application, but enough
accurate material exists in this field to give someone with the
Parapsychology Concentration a limited knowledge of current
magical theory. In 2055, a handful of historians and scholars study
parapsychology, as do those magically active individuals who
believe that their abilities fit into the parapsychological or psionic
model (see Awakened Oddities, p. 104).
CONJURING
Conjuring is the skill of summoning, controlling and dismissIng various spirits that dwell in astral space. Each magical tradition
calls upon specific types of spirits.
Mundane Use: The Conjuring Skill includes knowledge of the
rituals used to control and ward against spirits, and mundanes
sometimes learn this skill as a means of defending themselves
against spirit powers. Anyone, mundane or magician, who possesses the Conjuring Skill can use that Skill Level to resist the
effects of a spirit's powers (in place of an appropriate Attribute).
Mundane characters may also use Conjuring to summon and bind
free spirits, provided the character knows the spirit's true name.
Concentrations and Specializations
Summoning: The Summoning Concentration improves a
magician's Conjuring Skill for calling spirits. While some magicians
Concentrate on summoning. it is generally considered poor magical practice because it leaves the magician with less expertise in
controlling and banishing (do not call up that which you cannot
put down, as Agrippa put it). Summoning can be further
Specialized by spirit type (Fire Elemental, Forest Spirit and so on).
Banishing: Banishing dismisses spirits of all types back to the
metaplanes. This Conjuring Concentration is equally useful against
all spirits by all magicians. Many magicians Concentrate in banishing, especially "exorcists" and characters who often deal with
hostile spirits, such as mage-detectives. Banishing can be further
Specialized by spirit class (Elemental, Nature Spirit, Watcher and
so on) and type (Fire Elemental, City Spirit and so on).
Controlling: Controlling or binding involves taking command
of a spirit from another magician (controlling one's own spirits is
covered by summoning). Magicians can use this Concentration in
control contests (p. 143, SRII) either offensively or defensively.
Controlling can be further Specialized by spirit type (Fire
Elemental, Forest Spirit and so on).
Spirit Type: Because each magical tradition summons a specific class of spirits, a magician may choose to Concentrate on conjuring a specific spirit type within that class. For example, a mage
could choose to Concentrate in Conjuring Earth Elementals, thus
gaining a bonus to summon, control and banish them. Magicians
of all disciplines can also Concentrate in conjuring watchers (which
represent a unique spirit class).
Ally Spirits
Characters may use a Concentration in Ally Spirits to improve
their chances of success in all Conjuring Tests involving their own
ally spirit.
Free Spirits
Because each free spirit is a unique being, characters cannot
learn a general Conjuring Concentration for free spirits. However,
characters may learn a Conjuring Specialization for a specific free
spirit with which they are familiar. The character need not know
the spirit's true name to learn this Specialization, but will not be
able to use Conjuring on the spirit until he learns its true name.
Particularly single-minded (some say obsessive) magicians and
mundanes have been known to learn Conjuring for a specific spirit and spend years seeking its true name in order to use their
Specialization.
ENCHANTING
Characters may use the Enchanting Skill to make and analyze
magical materials such as foci, fetishes and alchemical radicals.
Mundane Use: The Talismongering Concentration (see
below) does not require magical ability and can be learned equally well by mundanes and magicians alike (indeed, many successful talismongers possess no magical gifts).
Concentrations and Specializations
Talismongering: The Talismongering Concentration increases
a character's aptitude in gathering materials for magical use and
refining them, making fetishes and ritual materials, and identifying
magical materials. Talismongers can further Specialize in each of
those individual tasks (gathering/refining materials, making fetishes and ritual materials, magic item identification).
Alchemy: Alchemy is the art of refining raw materials into
alchemical radicals that are useful for making magical items. The
alchemical process also produces the magical metal orichalcum
that is so vital in many enchanting processes. Characters can learn
an Alchemy Specialization in each of the arcana (Herbs, Minerals
and Metals). An expanded list of magical supplies and costs
appears in the Magical Equipment Table, p. 157.
Artificing: Characters use the Artificing Concentration to create magical foci and reduce the bonding cost of ready-made foci.
An enchanter can Specialize in a particular type of focus as listed
in the Shadowrun rulebook or Grimoire Il, but very few
enchanters can afford such a narrow field in their art. These rare
few are extremely skilled, however, and command the highest
prices for their masterpieces of enchanting work.
SORCERY
The Sorcery Skill allows characters to manipulate astral energies to create magical effects in the real world. Sorcery is the
broadest magical skill, covering all aspects of controlling and
shaping the energies of astral space to the magician's will. The
Sorcery Skill allows the individuality of the magician to shine
through. While magical theory represents the "facts" of magic,
sorcery represents the "art." Each mage manipulates magic as he
or she understands it. Harlequin, Sally Tsung and Gordo the Mage
may all toss hellblast spells with the same effect (as far as a mundane can tell), but what each mage sees as the magic forms at his
or her fingertips depends on the individual (see Spell Signatures,
p. 97). For example, Gordo always visualizes his magic as shooting from a giant fire hose. Hey, it works for him.
Mundane Use: Mundanes have no use for the Sorcery Skill,
because it is based entirely on the manipulation of energies that
they cannot access. While it is theoretically possible for a mundane to learn the Sorcery Skill, it would be extremely difficult to
do so without any way to practice what he or she learns. A mundane character who knows Sorcery and who somehow finds himself on the astral plane (for example, through an astral gate created by a free spirit) could use Sorcery to engage in astral combat.
Quite frankly, most people have better things to do with their
time and Karma than wait and train for such an unlikely combination of events.
Concentrations and Specializations
Astral: The Astral Concentration covers the use of Sorcery in
the astral plane: astral (melee) combat and the complex manipulations of metamagic. The Astral Concentration of the Sorcery Skill
does not apply to spellcasting while astral projecting or on a
metaplane. A character may further Specialize in either Astral
Combat or Metamagic. Physical adepts with the astral perception
power often learn a Specialization in Astral Combat.
Forensic Magic: This Concentration deals with the peculiarities of magically gathering and using criminal evidence.
Characters mainly use this Concentration to find and gather samples of evidence that can function as material links for ritual sorcery. If the magician finds a usable sample, this Concentration
increases his chances of making a successful Forensic Magic Test
(see p. 35, Grimoire II).
Spellcasting: The Spellcasting Concentration improves a
character's aptitude in the right-here-and-now magic that
addresses an immediate need. Magicians learn to quickly channel
astral energies into a preset pattern defined by the spell formula.
Characters may Specialize in one of the five spell categories.
Combat mages and many street magicians learn the Spellcasting
Concentration of the Sorcery Skill in order to draw on immediate
bang-for-the-buck effects.
Ritual: The Ritual Concentration represents the opposite side
of the coin from spellcasting. Ritual magic builds up power slowly, but allows the character to cast more complex spells and to
coordinate his efforts with other magicians in order to draw on
even greater power. Academic magicians and some R&D wage
mage types tend to be most proficient at ritual magic, and the
Ritual Concentration of the Sorcery Skill is highly recommended
for followers of voudoun. The few mundanes who bother to learn
Sorcery often choose to learn ritual magic. Characters may
Specialize in one of the five spell categories.
Spell Defense: The Spell Defense Concentration allows magicians to redirect hostile magical forces back into the astral and
away from the target of those forces. If the magician can use
metamagic, this Concentration also applies to Shielding.
Bodyguard magicians and those who specialize in the creation of
wards often learn the Spell Defense Concentration. Characters
may Specialize in one of the five spell categories.
Spell Category: A magician can learn a Concentration in one
of the five spell categories (combat, detection, health, illusion,
manipulation). Shamanic and elemental adepts often learn a
Concentration for spells in their own area of expertise, as do magicians with a specific spellcasting focus, such as combat sorcerers
or healers. Characters may further Specialize by technique (spellcasting or ritual sorcery). Note that a magician who Concentrates
in a spell category reduces his skill in all other spell categories,
including spell defense against spells outside his Concentration.
All Concentrations and Specializations reduce the character's
effectiveness at the general skill while increasing his effectiveness
in the Concentration and Specialization of that skill (see p. 70,
SRII). Because the Magic Pool is based on the skill, Concentration
or Specialization being used during the character's action, the
Magic Pool changes according to whether the character is taking
his action using the general skill, the Concentration or the
Specialization. As usual, a magician may allocate any number of
dice from his Magic Pool for spell defense.
Zorch the street mage has a Sorcery Skill of 6, with
a Concentration in Spellcasting and a Specialization in
Combat Spells-he can really kick some butt. This configuration gives Zorch Sorcery 8 for casting combat
spells, Sorcery 6 for other types of spellcasting and a rating of 4 for all other uses of the Sorcery Skill. When
Zorch throws a fireball at a bunch of gangers, his Magic
Pool is at 8 dice (he cannot use all of those dice for casting his spell, however, because he may only use a number of Magic Pool dice for any action equal to his Magic
Attribute, which is 5). When he attempts to heal one of
his chummers who's been shot, his Magic Pool is at 6
dice. If he needs to use spell defense to deflect a toxic
shaman's acid spell, his Magic Pool is at 4 dice.
NEW SKILLS
The following new skills add to the skills, Concentrations and
Specializations described in the Shadowrun rulebook.
ETIQUETTE (MAGICAL)
As a group, the Awakened tend to be fairly tightly knit.
Though they may ascribe to different opinions, world views and
lifestyles, something about all magically active people sets them
apart from the mundane world and encourages them to close
ranks when threatened. The Magical Concentration of the
Etiquette Skill allows a character to communicate effectively with
the unique subculture of the magically active. Characters with this
skill know the right things to say and do when dealing with magicians and their affairs: where, when and how they meet, the ranking and customs of social circles, what to say and what to avoid
saying, and so on. Certain mundanes learn this skill, especially if,
like talismongers, they must deal extensively with magicians.
Characters may Specialize in this skill according to magical tradition or specific geographic area.
Mundane Use: This skill is entirely mundane and can be
learned and used by any character.
AURA READING (PSYCHOMETRY)
A character can use the Special Skill of Aura Reading (also
known as Psychometry) to gain information by assensing auras in
astral space (p. 145, SRII). Characters may use their Aura Reading
skill rating in place of their Intelligence when making an Astral
Perception Test to gain information from an aura. This skill defaults
to Magical Theory and to Willpower on the Skill Web, but not to
Conjuring. Sorcery or Enchanting. Physical adepts who can use
astral perception and the astral adept (see Astral Adepts, p. 110)
can also use this skill. Mundanes cannot use this skill.
Assensing Cyberware
Assensing a subject's aura gives the magician a basic idea of
the subject's Essence and Magic Ratings, which in turn offers a
crude means to determine if someone has cyberware. In other
words, if a person possesses a very low Essence Rating, he or she
most likely carries cyberware. The assensing does not reveal to
the magician anything about the kind of cyberware carried or its
function, though at the gamemaster's discretion, a magician who
scores a high number of successes on an Astral Perception Test
might be able to determine the general location of implanted
cyberware. For example, he might notice that the target's aura
varies slightly around the left arm. Bioware is even more difficult
to detect by assensing. To determine if an assensing magician
detects the presence of bioware, the gamemaster should make an
Astral Perception Test against a Target Number of 10 minus the
target's Body Index.
The assensing magician may use the Aura Reading Skill for
the required Astral Perception Tests.
Detecting Assensing
A target magician may attempt to catch another magician in
the act of reading his or her aura. If a character attempts to determine if a magician is using astral perception to assense him or her,
the player makes a Perception Test against a target number equal
to twice the assensing magician's Magic Rating. If the character is
capable of astral perception but not astrally active, subtract 2 from
the target number. An astrally active character will automatically
know if a magician is attempting to assense his aura.
ASTRAL STEALTH
The degree of stealth that a character can achieve in the physical world is not possible in astral space, mainly because all living
things display bright auras on the etheric plane that cannot be hidden. An astrally active character cannot hide in shadows, rely on
background activity to distract his opponent, hide his tracks or
make use of the Stealth Skill. A character can mask his true nature
and trick his opponent into believing he is mundane or is less
powerful by using metamagic, but the glowing aura of a living
being cannot be magically concealed. Characters attempting to
hide in astral space must use material cover (non-living objects
such as walls, vehicles, roads, large paintings and so on) to block
their auras from observers. Gamemasters may apply the Cover
modifiers (p. 185, SRII) and the astral perception modifiers (p. 86,
Grimoire II) to Perception Tests made in astral space when the target is attempting to use material cover. Characters may also
attempt to cover their auras in the astral plane by using the Astral
Static spell to interfere with Perception Tests.
SPELL SIGNATURES
The effects of a Shadowrun spell remain pretty much the
same from one magician to another: a fireball is a fireball, no matter who casts it (see Sorcery, p. 95). However, the way a spellcaster manipulates magic to get that "same effect" can vary greatly from one magic user to the next. For example, one magician
might use the same color for all visible spell effects, another might
accompany all spells with a specific image or sound. In addition
to unique visual or audio effects, shamans may incorporate elements of their shamanic mask into their spells. These various
effects comprise the magician's spell "signature," a recognizable
characteristic that another magican can find as distinctive as a
written signature.
In Shadowrun, knowledge is power. A magician's spell signature identifies him as uniquely as a fingerprint and provides a
perspective into his relationship with magic. The way the magician's mind controls and processes the magical essence needed
to cast spells creates his spell signature. Though spellcasters
taught by the same instructor might seem to possess similar signatures, they can be more accurately characterized as variations
on a theme. In theory, a magician can learn another spellcaster's
magical tradition and heritage, and even how or where he was
trained from his spell signature-a very powerful bit of knowledge. If a magician can identify an opponent by his spell signature, with repeated exposure to that foe he can learn the types of
spells and magical tactics his opponent prefers and judge his
strengths and weaknesses. That knowledge will allow him to create an appropriate strategy for battling that particular mage, which
will make him a valuable asset to any team likely to encounter that
magic user.
Because a magician's spell signature represents the unique
way he manipulates astral energy on the physical plane, spells
cast in astral space or seen from astral space cannot reveal a spellcaster's signature. Only magic users with the Sorcery Skill, including the sorcerer, shamanic and elemental adepts, possess a spell
signature. Corporations make a practice of hiring spellcasting
adepts for the express purpose of observing and learning to recognize other spellcasters' signatures, to create reference "portfolios" of magical signatures.
As with nearly everything in Shadowrun, there are ways for
the gamemaster to use magic signatures to seriously mess with
their players' heads. For example, because magicians trained by
the same people may have very similar signatures, characters may
mistake their enemies for their allies and drop their guard if they
suspect that the mage they are fighting is someone they know.
Once the concept of spell signatures is introduced into the game.
magically active characters must contend with the paranoia that
someone might be studying their signature every time they cast a
spell. Ultimately, however, the gamemaster determines the
importance of spell signatures in his game.
OBSERVING A SPELL SIGNATURE
A magician may attempt to observe another magician's spell
signature by making a Perception Test against the Magic Rating of
the magician being observed. This is a Simple Action. The
gamemaster should use all of the standard perception modifiers
(see p. 185, SRII). The gamemaster can reduce the target number
(to a minimum of 2) if the character knows the spellcaster is going
to cast a spell. The decision to observe the spell must be made
during the same combat turn as the casting. After that any trace
of the physical manipulation of magic through the caster is gone.
A single success means the character observes the spell signature.
IDENTIFYING A SPELL SIGNATURE
Observing and identifying a spell signature are two completely different matters. These two things must take place within the same Combat Turn, meaning that the spell must be cast
while the observing player has two phases of action left before a
new combat turn.
A character must observe the spell signature before making
any attempt to identify it. In order to identify another magician's
spell signature, a magic user must block his own magical preferences, a task that requires a certain amount of concentration and
therefore takes a Complex Action. A magician attempting to identify a spellcaster's signature makes a Signature Test using his
Sorcery Skill (or the Forensic Magic Concentration) against a target number equal to the Sorcery Skill of the magic user casting the
spell. The magician need not have line of sight to the target spellcaster, but must be able to see the spell "effect" or the target of
the spell. Modify the skill used for the Signature Test by +1 for
each initiate grade of the character attempting to identify the spell
signature. The target magician also adds 1 die to his Sorcery Skill
for each initiate grade he holds. A single success reveals the target magician's spell signature. No successes means the magician
cannot suppress his magical preferences sufficiently to identify the
other magician's spell signature.
If a magician wants another magician to be able to identify his
spell signature (a useful ability for two mages on the same team),
he may describe it. In this case, the magician attempting to identify the target magician's spell signature makes a Signature (2)
Test.
If a mundane character is attempting to identify a magician's
spell signature, increase the Signature Test target number by 4.
A gamemaster may want to include an optional "recognizing" test. This is a standard Perception Test against whatever target number the gamemaster chooses (use the Skill Success Table
on p. 68, SRII, for guidelines). If the initial Signature Test took
place during an important event (the magician's team won a stunning victory, the team lost four members to a particularly spectacular magic effect, a new paranormal creature was born. an evil
company was put permanently and dramatically out of business),
the spellcaster is the character's personal nemesis, the player's
character increased his initiate grade, or the signature is so unique
that the character couldn't possibly forget it, the gamemaster
may decide the character will automatically recognize it and
waive this optional Perception Test.
The gamemaster may choose to increase the Perception Test
target number to recognize a spell signature if the character has
not seen the signature for a significant length of time. He may also
increase the target number if the target spellcaster has undergone
any extreme changes in the interim, such as suffering Magic
Rating loss, increasing his initiate grade or altering his spell signature (see below).
Kretch finds himself in a fire fight again. He's watching a mage chuck some pretty killer hellblasts from the
inside of a warehouse. Kretch can't see the mage (nor
does he know who he or she is working for), so he
decides the best plan is to study up on the mage's spell
signature. Because the mage in the warehouse went first
(with an initiative of 21, while Kretch's are at 15 and 5),
Kretch decides to use a Simple Action (at 15) to observe
the signature. He makes a successful Perception Test
and sees the ripples of the astral and physical world collide.
On Kretch's next phase (5) he tries to read the signature and identify it. Kretch is a Grade 1 initiate with a
Sorcery Skill of 6. (No forensic magic for him.) He rolls
his seven dice for the Signature Test and gets
10,9,5,4,2,1, and 1. Because the combat mage inside is
a Grade 4 initiate with a Sorcery Skill of 5, the Target
Number for the test was 9, so Kretch has rolled 2 successes. Had Kretch failed the Signature Test (he just
can't break through his personal image of a big neon
corkscrew), he would have had to start over on his next
turn with another attempt to observe the spell signature.
The gamemaster has decided not to tell Kretch if he
was successful until he rolls a "recognizing" Perception
Test. She gives this Perception Test a Base Target
Number of 8 (Kretch has seen this signature before, but
well over a year ago). Kretch succeeds again. The
gamemaster describes the signature, saying it looks like
light going through a prism; a very different signature
than Kretch's big neon orange corkscrew. Hey, he does
remember that prism thing-it belongs to some yakuza
chick he thought he wasted in a run a long time ago.
The gamemaster has decided the "yakuza chick"
has a personal vendetta against Kretch, and so the mage
will show up to plague Kretch at every opportunity. The
gamemaster decides that after observing and identifying
the spell signature, Kretch remembers it automatically
because the yak mage has become his worst nightmare.
From now on, he will not need to make any more "recognizing" tests.
ALTERING THE SPELL SIGNATURE
Though a magician cannot mask his spell signature, he can
attempt to alter it. Beginning with initiate Grade 1, a character can
attempt to alter his spell signature as part of the initiation process.
If a character decides to alter his signature during initiation, he
cannot remove a geas and does not add the new initiate grade to
his Magic Attribute Rating. He receives all the other bonuses of his
new initiate grade, however.
To alter his spell signature, a character must unlearn how he
uses and interacts with magic and then relearn those processes.
The character makes a Sorcery Test against his Magic Attribute
Rating, adding 1 die per initiate grade to the total Sorcery dice.
No other dice can be added to this test. A minimum of 2 successes means the character succeeded in learning to use magic a
different way.
If the test is successful, the magician may make a slight alteration to his signature, though some similarity must remain
between the old and new signatures. For example, Kretch can
change the color of his corkscrew to black, or he can change the
corkscrew shape to a neon-orange dagger. Kretch should not be
allowed to change his signature to a giant pie in the face, though
a giant neon-orange pie might be acceptable. The gamemaster
has final approval over all spell signature alterations.
If the attempt to alter the spell signature fails, the mage continues to use his or her "old" signature to manipulate magic. For
each unsuccessful attempt to change the spell signature, increase
the target number for each future attempt by 1. This modifier represents that fact that the character's attempt to change his signature is in fact reinforcing his magical process.
MAGIC LOSS
Perhaps the most frightening thing that can happen to a
magic user is the permanent loss of all or part of his or her magic
skill. Inappropriate medical attention, a mortal wound, and the
presence of cyberware represent only the broadest paths to such
loss. The following optional rule offers a more realistic effect
regarding the use of stim patches.
STIM PATCHES (OPTIONAL RULE)
The Shadowrun rulebook states that stim patches have the
potential to reduce a magician's Magic Attribute Rating. However,
the current rule makes it possible for a magician to use Rating 1
stim patches one after another with very little chance of failing a
Magic Test (except for the chance of all Is). To better reflect the
spirit of this rule, the gamemaster should keep track of the total
rating of stim patches used by a magician in a 24-hour period and
require the character to make a single Magic Test against that
total. If the character fails the test, the player rolls 2D6. If the result
is equal to or less than the character's current Magic Rating, the
magician permanently loses 1 point of Magic, as if he had taken a
Deadly wound.
METAMAGIC
As increasing numbers of initiated magicians gain access to
magic's higher mysteries, they discover new metamagical powers
and new uses for existing powers. The gamemaster should examine the following additions to metamagic and decide whether or
not to incorporate them into his game. If he chooses to add these
powers to his magic system, the gamemaster should decide if they
represent new powers or simply outgrowths of existing powers.
However the gamemaster chooses to use them, these new powers
should remain rare and mysterious for quite some time.
The associated area of metamagic appears in parentheses following the name of each new ability.
Net
REFLECTIVE SHIELDING (SHIELDING)
The reflective shielding ability functions in much the same
way as the normal metamagical ability of shielding (p. 45.
Grimoire II). The magician allocates shielding dice as usual, but
rather than increasing the opposition's target number for the
attack, the reflective shield produces a different effect. If the successes rolled only with the shielding dice to defend against the
attack exceed the successes rolled by the attacking magician, the
spell rebounds and attacks the casting magician with a Force
equal to the net number of successes, up to a maximum of the
original Force. The defending magician then makes a Spell
Success Test for the rebounded spell.
Talon is attacked by a wage mage and throws up a
reflective shield using the 6 Magic Pool dice he allocated for defense. The attacking magician throws a Force 4
mana bolt spell, augmented by 3 dice from his Magic
Pool. The wage mage rolls 7 dice against a Target
Number of 6 (Talon's Willpower) and gets 2 successes.
Talon rolls his 6 shielding dice against a Target Number
of 4, achieving 4 successes. The mana bolt rebounds
against the wage mage with a Force of 2, and Talon
makes a Spell Success Test using 2 dice against a Target
Number of 6 (the wage mage's Willpower).
A magician hit by a reflected spell may use unallocated
Magic Pool dice as well as spell defense or shielding dice to resist
the effects of the rebounded attack. Eventually, reflected shielding
may force an attacker to exhaust his defense dice resisting his
own spells, leaving him open to the defender's attack. A reflected spell can be reflected again by the original caster if that magician is also an initiate. If the spell's Force drops to 1, an attempt
to reflect it dissipates it instead. Spells cast through ritual sorcery
can be reflected (providing the target allocated enough Magic
Pool dice), in which case the spell affects equally all members of
the casting ritual circle.
Even before the Awakening, both Western and tribal magic
systems described this kind of shielding as possible, and initiates
of both traditions use reflective shielding. Initiates cannot combine
reflective and standard shielding.
CLEANSING (DISPELLING)
Similar to dispelling, cleansing is a metamagical technique
that allows an initiate to clear astral "clutter" from the etheric
plane. The ability has two main uses: eliminating astral traces left
behind by the use of sorcery, the presence of spirits and so on;
and clearing away temporary background count (see Temporary
Background Count, p. 104).
To cleanse an astral area of the traces left behind by spellcasting or the presence of spirits, an initiate makes a Sorcery Test
against a target number equal to the Force of the phenomenon
that caused the trace, minus the initiate's grade (minimum Target
Number of 2). Each success on this test increases by 1 the difficulty of subsequent tests made to find traces of specific activity in
astral space. Following the Sorcery Test, the magician must make
a Willpower Test to resist Drain equal to the Drain resisted by the
magician who created the astral traces or background count.
Centering may be used against this Drain. Cleansing only affects
the astral presence of activity on the etheric plane; the burn and
blast marks and other physical damage caused by a spell remain.
Felicia, a Grade 1 initiate, is attempting to cleanse
the astral traces of a Force 5 mana bolt spell that she used
to fell a guard barghest. She makes a Sorcery Test against
a Target Number of 4 (the force of the mana bolt minus
her initiate grade) and scores 3 successes. (Felicia also
needs to make a second Drain Resistance Test to resist
the Drain of cleansing.) When the corp's wage mage later
examines the site for clues to who and what killed the
barghest, his target number for spotting Felicia's handiwork increases by 3.
In order for an intiate to use the cleansing ability to clear away
temporary background count, the cause of the background count
must first be removed. For example, an attempt to cleanse the
background count created by a poisoned river will not be effective until the physical pollution is cleared from the water.
Cleansing does not affect lasting, long-term background counts of
sites imbued with powerful emotions, such as the Great Pyramids
or Auschwitz, nor can cleansing dispel the background count created by the Astral Static spell. As always, the gamemaster has
final say on whether or not a specific background count can be
affected by cleansing.
Cleansing the temporary background count also erases
any other astral traces associated with the event that caused
the background count, such as sorcery or the presence of spirits. If a magician wishes to assense an area for information, he
must do so before he or any other magician cleanses that part
of the astral plane.
An initiate may only attempt to cleanse an area whose background count is at a level less than or equal to his inititate grade.
Make a Sorcery Test against a target number of (Background
Count x 2). The background count is reduced by 1 level for every
2 successes. Following the Sorcery Test, the inititate must resist
(Level)D Drain using Willpower. The initiate may use his Centering
Skill to reduce Drain.
After completing his study of a murder site, Dr.
O'Malley, a forensic magician, works to clear the miasma
of evil that hangs over the area. O'Malley is a Grade 2
initiate with Sorcery 6. The crime created a Background
Count of 2. O'Malley makes a Sorcery Test against a
Target Number of 4 and achieves 4 successes, enough to
reduce the background count to 0 and eliminate the
eerie feeling that hung over the area.
FOCUS BLOCKING (DISPELLING)
The metamagical technique of focus blocking allows an initiate
to attempt to deactivate another magician's focus by severing the
astral link between the focus and the magician. The initiate must
spend a Complex Action to use astral perception and see the focus.
The character makes a Sorcery or Enchanting Test against a target
number equal to the rating of the focus. If the test is successful, the
focus is deactivated, but otherwise undamaged. If the owner wants
to use the focus, he must spend a Simple Action to reactivate it. An
initiate can block any focus with a rating equal to or less than his initiate grade. Following the Sorcery or Enchanting Test, the initiate
must resist Drain of (Focus Rating)M. The magician can only block
one focus per test. Focus blocking has no effect on sustained, quickened or anchored spells, but can affect spell locks.
WARDS
This section expands the rules for wards as described on page 92 of Grimoire II, to allow magicians to create several different types of wards.
ATTUNED WARDS
Standard wards are astral barriers that block all movement in
astral space. Even the ward's creator cannot penetrate the barrier
it creates. While this is fine for most uses, on some occasions the
ward's creator may want to be able to move freely through the
ward. In this case, a magician may create an attuned ward, a type
of ward that matches its creator's aura. Because the ward and the
magician's aura exist on what can be viewed as the same wavelength, the ward's creator can pass through his own astral barrier
at will, while the ward functions normally to block the movement
of all other astral presences.
In addition to arranging to be protected by physical bodyguards, magicians often construct attuned wards around their
bodies before astrally projecting or questing to keep unwanted
astral presences away from the vacant body. The cost for creating
an attuned ward is 1,000 nuyen in material per Force Rating.
The only way for a second magician to penetrate a standard
ward is to defeat the ward in astral combat, and such an attack
always alerts the ward's creator to a hostile astral presence. Attuned
wards may be defeated in astral combat or with the metamagical
ability of dispelling. An initiate may attempt to "synchronize" his
aura with that of the ward's creator; if he succeeds, the ward "recognizes" him and allows him to pass through the barrier.
For an initiate to synchronize his aura with an attuned ward,
the magician must make a standard dispelling attempt against a
target number equal to the Force or the Barrier Rating of the ward,
whichever is higher. Reduce the target number by 2 if the attuned
ward was created by a non-initiate magician. For every 2 successes, reduce the Barrier Rating by 1. If the successes reduce the
Barrier Rating to 0, the magician can pass through the ward.
Note that the ward is not dispelled nor is the barrier
destroyed; the magician has just momentarily "widened" the
attunement of the spell to accept his aura. A successful dispelling
attempt allows only the dispelling initiate to move through the
ward. The ward will not admit a second person.
If the dispelling attempt fails to reduce the ward's Barrier
Rating to 0, the initiate cannot bypass the ward.
CONCEALMENT WARDS
The concealment ward does not block the passage of astral
beings, but makes it more difficult to use detection spells, assensing, and critter powers such as Search within the boundaries of the
ward. A concealment ward also increases the target number of
the Sending Test for ritual sorcery. Add the Rating of the ward to
the target number for these tasks. Concealment wards cost 500
nuyen in materials per Force Rating of the ward.
Initiates may create a variation of the concealment ward called
the masking ward. A masking ward offers all the advantages of a
concealment ward, and also masks any magical effect or phenomenon within its bounds to appear mundane. The magical effect or
phenomenon must be of a Force equal to or less than the Force of
the ward. For example, a magician who wanted to plant a Rating 3
spell lock in a rival's office cubicle would have to erect a Force 3 or
greater masking ward to increase the chances that the lock would
remain undetected. However, this ward can be penetrated in the
same manner as a magician's personal Masking. The magician
attempting to penetrate the masking ward makes a Magic Success
Test against the Force Rating of the ward. Subtract the Force of the
ward from the number of successes. If the result is equal to or
greater than the initate grade of the magician that created the ward,
the viewer sees through the masking ward.
ALARM WARDS
An alarm ward does not block the passage of astral beings or
magic; indeed, it is difficult to detect in astral space as anything
other than a faint shimmer. Magicians may make an Astral
Perception (Ward Rating) Test to detect an alarm ward. An alarm
ward simply alerts its creator when an astral entity crosses its
boundaries. If a magician or spirit attacks and destroys the ward,
its creator knows immediately. Alarm wards can be attuned so
that the alarm will sound when anyone other than the ward's creator passes through the ward. Initiates may synchronize their
auras to sneak through an alarm ward in the same way as for an
attuned ward. Alarm wards cost 500 nuyen in materials per Force
Rating of the ward.
WARDS AND FOCI
Standard wards attempt to block all astrally active entities,
everything from active foci to sustained, locked or quickened
spells. If a character carrying one of these items (or spells) tries to
pass through a ward, the gamemaster makes a Success Test using
a number of dice equal to the ward's Force against a target number equal to the Rating of the item or spell. If the gamemaster
achieves a number of successes equal to or greater than the item
Rating, the item is destroyed. Any other result means the item or
spell passes safely through the ward. The gamemaster may
choose to keep these tests secret, only revealing the loss of the
spell or foci when the character attempts to use it.
An active item or spell passing through a ward may create a
slight visible discharge of energy. an astral echo-shimmer.
Characters may spot this effect by making a Perception Test
against a target number equal to the difference between the
Rating of the item and the Force of the ward. For example, a spell
lock (Rating 1) passing through a Force 5 ward would have a
Target Number of 4. A Rating 5 weapon focus passing through the
same ward would have a Target Number of 2 (5 - 5 = 0, minimum
Target Number of 2).
SPIRITS
This section expands on the published Shadowrun rules for spirits.
MANIFESTING
Though all spirits can manifest, most prefer to remain in astral
form to perform their services whenever possible, assuming manifest form only if they are commanded or required to do so. As a
general rule, spirits in astral form can only exercise those powers
that affect themselves or their summoner, such as Guard,
Concealment or Aid Sorcery. In order to use its powers on another subject, the spirit must manifest, thus becoming vulnerable to
being disrupted in combat.
COMBAT
When a mundane person attacks a manifest spirit in hand-tohand combat, he is engaging in a kind of struggle of wills with the
spirit. Because skill is of less use against a spirit than unshakable
courage, the character fights using Willpower rather than a relevant Combat Skill. Combat Pool dice cannot be added to
Willpower Tests for attacking spirits, but they may be used to
dodge the attacks of manifest spirits.
Because the physical combat mostly serves as a representation of the struggle that actually takes place between the character and the spirit, the physical properties of the character's
weapon are less important than its symbolic properties.
Symbolically, a sword is a sword, and against a spirit an ancient
broadsword is just as effective as a modern carbon-steel
monoblade.
In game terms, technological enhancements to melee
weapons such as monofilament edges, laser attachments.
Dikote™ and so on do not allow the character to inflict additional
damage when fighting a manifest spirit. Use only the base
Damage Code of the weapon to calculate damage. A character's
own Strength enhancements do increase the weapon's damage,
provided these enhancements are magical in nature (spells, adept
abilities and so on) or the character paid Essence or Body Index for
the enhancement (i.e., cyberware or bioware enhancements). Any
other damage enhancements do not carry the force of the character's living will and cannot affect the spirit.
Blade the street ronin is fighting an elemental using
his Dikote™-covered katana. He usually inflicts 12S
damage with the katana, but Blade gains no benefits
from the Dikote™ against the elemental. Therefore, his
sword inflicts 11M damage.
NATURE SPIRIT DOMAINS
The Shadowrun rulebook and Grimoire II provide detailed
rules for conjuring nature spirits. This section offers clarifications
for those rules.
In terrain that meets the qualifications of multiple nature spirit domains, such as a wooded mountain slope, the conjuring
shaman must choose a single domain with which to interact. If the
shaman chooses one domain and then shifts his attention to a different domain, he is considered to have left that domain and any
nature spirit performing services for the shaman will depart.
Sandra Willowfall is stuck on the slope of Mt.
Rainier, playing hide-and-seek with some Salish-Shidhe
troops. She calls upon the forest spirit to conceal her
from the troops. Unfortunately for Sandra, one of the
troopers gets lucky and spots her despite the spirit's
help. She decides to go to her backup plan and cause a
rock slide to disable their jeep, so she shifts her focus to
the mountain and calls upon its spirit. The forest spirit
fades along with the concealment it was providing, and
the the rest of the patrol spots the shaman as she sings
the song to call up the mountain spirit. It had better be
a big one.
A shaman may only conjure a single nature spirit for any
given domain, though he may give the spirit a command and then
move from its domain. The spirit will continue to carry out the
shaman's command to the best of its ability until the task is completed or until the spirit's time of service expires. The shaman can
immediately conjure a new nature spirit in the domain to which
he moved without penalty.
Street shaman Tommy Dre gets an unexpected visit
at his doss from Lone Star. He calls up the hearth spirit
he'd summoned earlier that day and tells it to keep the
Star boys busy for a while, then jumps out onto the fire
escape and swings down into the alley, where he conjures a city spirit to conceal him so he can slip past the
cruiser out front.

FOCI
This section offers one new focus and describes the game
implications of focus addiction.
CENTERING FOCUS
The centering focus enhances a character's concentration,
allowing the magician an additional number of dice equal to the
Focus Rating for Centering Tests. The magician can only gain a number of additional dice from the focus equal to or less than his
Centering Skill, and the focus must be active for the magician to gain
this bonus. Magic users who carry centering foci usually use one that
complements their Centering Skill, such as a musical instrument.
FOCUS ADDICTION
When a magician relies too heavily on foci, these devices
begin to serve as a "crutch" for his magic; in turn, the magician's
natural magical abilities eventually weaken in the same way that a
muscle deteriorates without regular use. Any time a magician
uses a number of foci with a total rating higher than his Magic
Attribute, he must make a Magic Test against a target number
equal to the total Foci Rating. (The total Foci Rating includes active
foci only, not bonuses granted by totems, spirits or local magical
forces such as background count.)
If the Magic Test is successful, the magician suffers no effect
from overuse of foci. If the test fails, roll 2D6. If the result is less
than or equal to the mage's Magic Rating, he permanently loses
1 point from his Magic Attribute.
A magician who loses 2 Magic Attribute points due to focus
abuse must take on a "focus" geas. This limitation means that the
character may only use his magical power through a focus. This
means the character may now cast, without penalty, only the
magic for which he possessed foci at the time he was forced to
take the focus geas; he must add 2 to the target number for all
other uses of magic. For example, if a character carried one power
focus, a manabolt spell lock, an invisibility spell lock, a hearth spirit focus and a combat spell focus at the time he took on the focus
geas, he could only use his foci to cast invisibility spells and manabolt and other combat spells normally, and summon, control and
banish hearth spirits normally. He would be forced to add 2 to the
target numbers for all other uses of magic.
The focus geas can be the first step on the road to the way of
the burnout. A magician who is most effective using foci will be
tempted to use multiple foci, which may repeatedly result in his
losing additional Magic Attribute points. Magicians who overuse
foci quickly find themselves on a rapid downward slide.
The focus geas may be shed like other geasa upon initiation
(p. 38, Grimoire II). A magician who chooses to ignore the focus
geas created by his addiction suffers from "withdrawal," which
has the same effects as those described in the Way of the
Burnout, p.52, Grimoire II.
A magician whose Magic Attribute is reduced to 1 can no
longer lose magic from overusing foci, though a character with a
focus geas must continue to observe that geas-unless he chooses to ignore it. This explains why so many burned-out mages feel
free to pile on the foci: they've got nothing left to lose.
Gus the street mage has Magic 5 and a whole truckload of foci: two spell locks, a Rating 4 power focus, a
Rating 3 spirit focus and a Rating 3 fireball spell focus. He
keeps the spell locks active all the time. He and his chummers run into some trouble during biz, and Gus activates
his spirit focus to deal with a hostile elemental, resulting
in an active Foci Rating total of 5 (3 + 2 [one for each for
the spell locks]). He's still in safe territory. Later on, Gus
wants to throw a really killer fireball, so he activates his
power and spell foci, giving him a total active Foci Rating
of 9 (including the spell locks). Gus has to make a Magic
Test against a Target Number of 9 to see if his excessive
use of foci has any effect. He fails the test and has to
check for Magic Attribute loss. Gus rolls 2 dice with a
result of 4. Yipes! Gus loses a Magic Attribute point. Gus
is a hurting mage. Now at a Magic Rating of 4, Gus needs
to get rid of one or both of his spell locks or he'll have to
make a Magic Test to determine whether or not he's
addicted to his foci every time he uses one of his other
foci. Either way, Gus is on his way to total burnout!
BACKGROUND COUNT
An explanation of the phenomenon of background count,
powerful natural or manmade influences that can affect the astral
plane, appears on page 89 of Grimoire II. This section expands on
that material by describing different types of astral terrain and
their effects on magic.
MANA LINES
Energies in astral space often flow in "streams," thin ribbons
of mana that follow the contours of the land. Though known by
many names-leys, feng lung, songlines, and dream paths,
among others-modern magical theorists call them mana lines.
Mana lines represent currents of astral power that a magician can
tap into and use to enhance or strengthen his or her magic.
Mana line ratings range from 1 (the weakest and most typical) to 4 (the strongest lines, such as the great leys of the British
Isles or the Australian songlines). A magician standing on a mana
line may add a number of dice equal to the mana line rating to his
Magic Pool so long as his magic does not conflict with the energies of the line or the land. Multiple magicians in contact with the
same mana line can all tap the mana line simultaneously.
The gamemaster determines the location and strength of all
mana lines in his game, though mana lines should remain fairly
rare. Traditionally, the especially strong mana lines represent sites
of great significance for many cultures. Generally speaking, places
that man has civilized (such as the modern sprawl) evidence few,
if any, mana lines, while wilderness areas and ancient sites of worship often lie on active mana lines.
POWER SITES
Locations tend to accumulate magical power if exposed to
magic over a long period; other sites seem to be naturally more
magically powerful than others. Caves, grottoes, mountains,
beaches, wells, crossroads and cliffs are traditional places of
power for magical workings. Such places often lie at a junction
where several mana lines cross. Power sites are rated from 1 to 5.
Magicians whose magic is in harmony with the energies of a
power site can add a number of dice equal to the power site rating to their Magic Pool. Just as with mana lines, power sites are
generally limited to isolated places and are rarely found within the
boundaries of the sprawl. The gamemaster determines the rating
and significance of power sites. As a point of reference in developing a workable scale, the gamemaster may consider the site of
the Great Ghost Dance to be the single most powerful magical
place in the Awakened Sixth World.
ASPECTED POWER
Mana lines, power sites and background count are often
"aspected," which is to say that the energies are aligned to favor
a specific kind of magic. Over time, locations can build up powerful impressions from the emotions experienced there, which
can shape the astral terrain in various ways that affect magic. For
example, a place that has been long devoted as a sacred site for
nature magic might grant extra dice only to those magicians conjuring nature spirits. The same site might possess a background
count that interferes only with the magic of those who are not
nature magicians.
Gamemasters can use aspected power sites as a means of
balancing the effects of magic in their Shadowrun games. For
example, if an adventure pits a magically powerful opponent
against the runner team, the gamemaster may have his character
repeatedly defeat the runners in the small battles, then set the climax of the story at a site where the non-player character's magic
is inhibited and the runner team's magic is enhanced.
TEMPORARY BACKGROUND COUNT
Much of the background count described in Grimoire II, such
as that found at highly sacred or polluted sites, is a permanent
phenomenon, barring some major change in the location. Various
ebbs and flows in the stuff of the etheric plane, however, can produce temporary eddies and currents that cause short-term background counts. For example, especially strong releases of emotion
or magic that impress a great deal of energy into the etheric medium, including extreme violence, powerful spells, riots, massive
rock concerts and ecstatic religious rituals, can create a temporary
background count. Once the source of the etheric impression is
gone. the background count will fade, lasting a few hours to several days or weeks (at the gamemaster's discretion), depending on
the strength and intensity of the original impression.
AWAKENED ODDITIES
The Shadowrun rules make only minor distinctions between
magical traditions. All magicians use magic in the same general
way, and there is no game difference between a manablast cast
by a rigid-minded wage mage, a neo-anarchist Coyote shaman, a
druid, an elven path follower, or a houngan. The Conjuring Skill is
the same no matter what type of magician is using it. Even spirits
follow the same basic rules, though their exact capabilities may
differ.
The various magical traditions described in Shadowrun products primarily offer roleplaying hooks to allow both players and
gamemasters to create unique and interesting magician characters and NPCs for their adventures. Rather than making every
spell-tosser the runners encounter the same-old same-old, the
gamemaster may use the material from any of the fictional pieces
presented earlier in this book or published in other Shadowrun
products to throw the occasional "wild card" character into an
adventure. After all, the Awakening is only 40 years old, and
nobody knows everything about magic. Keep the players guessing about the exact nature of what they are facing.
The following guidelines offer hints for gamemasters who
wish to include non-traditional magicians in their campaigns.
Keep in mind that these manifestations of magical talent remain
very rare, the kind of abilities that are written about in professional journals and compose the subject of scholarly research;
gamemasters should introduce these manifestations of magical
ability sparingly.
Gamemasters must decide whether or not to allow players to
create starting characters who manifest their magical talents in
these ways. These characterizations are not meant for starting
characters, but if a player decides that her character thinks "magic
ain't nuttin' but a bunch of mind tricks" and wants to play her
magic-user character that way, the gamemaster should feel free to
give it a shot.
PSIONICS
There are some few who still choose to believe that magic in
the Sixth World is some kind of manifestation of "the psychic
power of the mind." Some magicians even choose to define their
own abilities in terms of psionics rather than magic. All of the
known psionics are hermetics, usually the equivalent of Sorcery
adepts, though some rare psionics are actually full magicians. Even
those who may have the ability to conjure (in game terms) rarely.
if ever, do so, for they believe there is nothing to conjure but what
is in the mind. Psionics also avoid using physical spells; mana
spells are their bread and butter ("it's the power of the mind at
work"). All psionics work their magic under some kind of geas,
usually the self-created concentration geas. Basically a combination of the time, incantation and gesture geasa, this special geas
allows the psionicist to concentrate using whatever means necessary to evoke the power of the mind. Psionics may require a few
minutes or more to cast a spell (the "concentration time" of the
geas); that, added to the psionics' fondness for broad gestures and
screaming "focus and clear your mind" at the top of their lungs as
they prepare to use their power usually makes them unwelcome
as shadowrunners, but their magic works just the same.
Psionics are rarely invited to join magical groups for initiation,
as not believing in magic puts a real a damper on before-dinner
conversation. Most psionics self-initiate, using an ordeal of meditation, mental asceticism or thesis. All the standard initiate rules
apply, except that a psionic initiate can never remove his geas.
Even when a psionic uses metamagic, he must be able to explain
the power as a phenomenon of his mind. That is a fairly simple
explanation for centering, shielding and dispelling, but masking,
anchoring and quickening require some fairly complex mental
acrobatics. A psionic will use metamagical abilities that are difficult to rationalize as mental powers; he just has to work that much
harder to justify them.
If a psionic starts to believe in magic, he or she automatically loses 2 points from his or her Magic Attribute rating and must
take a second geas (this geas is in addition to the standard psionics geas). If the character denies either geas, he or she faces the
Way of the Burnout. In some cases ignorance is bliss.
RELIGION
Another way magic manifests for those not quite able to
believe in its existence is demonstrated in the way that evangelistic magicians and "street saints" focus their magical abilities
through their faith. The gamemaster can use these unusual characters to make players wonder about the real source of an NPC's
strange abilities. Sure, that thunderbolt looks like magic, but will a
mana barrier really turn aside the wrath of an unspecified god?
Shadowrun makes no judgments about the value of any individual religious belief. For the purposes of post-Awakening magic,
all belief systems are equally significant. The dogma counts for
less than the individual's faith in that dogma, which turns the
belief system into an effective magical tool. There is no religion
that is "better," magically speaking, than any other.
Gamemasters who wish to include bonuses for religion-based
magicians should use the totems offered in the Shadowrun rulebook as a general guideline. They may also find the idols
described in the Germany Sourcebook useful.
Religion-based magic does not fall easily into a "they do this
and they never use that" breakdown. Each character's take on his
religion is so unique that the gamemaster and the player must
together decide exactly how the belief manifests magically. Use
the following guidelines to discourage players from setting up
their characters as omnipotent, "my character thinks he is The Big
Kahuna and Ruler of the Universe so he can do everything"
beings. The religion-based magician must be either shamanic or
hermetic in nature. A religion-based magician must also have a
geas, such as his power can only be used in a place of worship,
only on Sundays, only on holy days, or it must be channeled
through the religion's icons. Religion-based magicians view their
magic as a gift from their deity, and the geas must fit appropriate
parameters.
If the religion-based magician ignores his geas, apply the
same penalties that befall the psionic. Religion-based magicians
must also self-initiate, as no teachers or magical groups would
count them as members. The gamemaster must approve the
ordeal the player chooses to fit his character's mindset, though a
search for holy relics might be appropriate for nearly every religion.
POP OCCULTISM
Because most "magicians" in this category are frauds or charlatans, they make interesting NPCs but frustrating player characters.
("OK, today is Tuesday and the third of the month. Does my character have use of his magic today?") The pop-occult magician might
claim to possess great magical powers, but just be a skillful con
artist with a good special-effects man. (The team magician says his
aura looks mundane, but can he be sure the bad guy's not masking?) For the rare, genuine magician who follows some outdated,
off-the-shelf magical philosophy, use the standard magic rules.
Most such individuals are adepts, not full magicians. The gamemaster may use the guidelines for creating a religion-based magician to
determine appropriate geasa and ordeals for these magicians.
SELF-CREATED TRADITIONS
Because a magic user who follows a self-created tradition
represents the potentially most unbalancing type of Shadowrun
magician, such characters should be limited to NPCs. The
gamemaster can use magicians following self-created traditions to
foil player expectations now and then, just as a reminder that the
denizens of the Sixth World actually know very little about how
magic works. If the gamemaster allows a player to design his own
magical tradition out of whole cloth, the player should use the
published traditions as a model for the basic abilities of the new
tradition; the self-created tradition should not offer any abilities
that no other magical tradition can offer.
PARANORMAL ANIMAL TOTEMS
The great majority of the published Shadowrun shamanic
totems are animals or archetypes that have been part of some culture's belief system for centuries. When the Awakening brought
to life creatures from ancient myth, certain rare shamans also felt
the call to follow these new totems.
Paranormal animal shamans represent the newest breed of
shaman appearing in the Awakened world, and a player character
who chooses a paranormal animal totem must prepare to face
some intense backlash. Because very few shamans hear the call of
paranormal animal totems, the paranormal animal shaman will
almost always be alone. Even large sprawls like Seattle will only
have a handful of these shamans, and those few most likely will
not follow the same totems.
Further, the lack of historical worship of the paranormal animal totems may encourage other, more traditional shamans to
either shun paranormal animal shamans as freaks or even attempt
to kill them out of the conviction that they must be toxic shamans.
Hermetic mages usually stay out of the "what totem is better"
argument, but even that community is of a divided opinion. Some
have trouble classifying the paranormal shaman, while others feel
that the Awakened world has so few rules that it makes as much
sense for there to be a Gargoyle totem as a Rat totem. As with
most magical issues in the Awakened world, the gamemaster
should decide how a paranormal animal totem fits into his individual campaign. .
GARGOYLE
A creature of living stone, Gargoyle is patient above all else,
able to remain motionless for hours, silently observing. He is a
fierce fighter, willing to wait and watch for the ideal moment to
strike and rend his prey. From his silent perch high above the city,
Gargoyle sees much and knows the value of knowledge.
Favored Environment: Urban
Advantages: +1 die for detection and illusion spells; +2 dice for conjuring city spirits
Disadvantages: - 1 die for conjuring Spirits of the Waters.
Gargoyle shamans are plotters and schemers. They prefer to carefully observe and gather information before making a move, planning their actions for maximum advantage. They refuse to act
hastily and will retreat if caught unaware, in order to plot their
next move. The Gargoyle shaman must live in either a skyscraper
or castle-like structure, which usually requires a high or luxury
lifestyle. Their homes always feature some sort of accessible
perch, walkway or balcony near the roof.
GRIFFIN
Griffin is a proud and fierce hunter, the savage lord of
the winds. A primal creature, Griffin is intimate
with the dance of life and death, hunter and
prey. Griffin may terrorize his target in
combat, but he will honor and respect a
capable opponent, for the hunt is a
sacred task, not a sport. Living high
in his mountain lair, Griffin sees
far and so learns the secrets of
the prey he depends on for life.
Favored
Environment:
Mountains
Advantages: +2 dice for
combat spells; +2 dice for
conjuring Spirits of the Sky
Disadvantages:
Griffin
shamans are proud and do
not suffer indignity from
those they consider beneath
them (which is most everyone
else). Any time the gamemaster
judges that the Griffin shaman has
been insulted or offended, the
shaman must make a Willpower Test
against an injury-modified Target
Number of 4 to avoid becoming enraged. If
the shaman rolls 2 or fewer successes, he or
she fails the test and flies into a berserk rage. For 3
turns, the shaman attacks the offender using his or her
most powerful physical or magical weapon. The rage ends after 3
turns or when the victim has been killed or incapacitated.
Griffin shamans are honorable combatants and will declare
the target of their attack, which is always the most powerful opponent they face in any battle. They will attack only that target until
the shaman or the enemy dies or is incapacitated. If a third party
steps into to "help" the shaman, the shaman will consider it an
insult and must make the Willpower Test described above.
LEVIATHAN
Great Leviathan dives to the deepest and darkest depths of
the sea, where he lives in eternal night. He carries his majestic
bulk gracefully in the heart of the waters and his song gives his
wisdom and knowledge to all the creatures of the deep. Life is as
simple and as complex as the movements of the tides and the
endless dance of life in the sea.
Favored Environment: On or near the sea
Advantages: +1 die for health and manipulation spells; +2 dice for
conjuring sea spirits
Disadvantages: - 1 die for illusion spells. Leviathan shamans are
almost preternaturally calm and unhurried, and slow to react at
times. A Leviathan shaman must be convinced, by use of an
opposed test, that he or she is needed. The character trying to
convince the shaman to take action makes a Charisma,
Negotiation or Etiquette (Magical) Test against a target number
equal to the unmodified Intelligence of the Leviathan shaman. The
Leviathan shaman rolls a number of dice equal to his or her
unmodified Intelligence against a target number
equal to the Charisma of the person trying to
convince him or her.
If the Leviathan shaman
does not achieve the highest net
successes, he will go along with
what is required of him. These
shamans will then pursue
their goal with a singleminded purpose, gearing
up for the exact task or
action requested. If the
plan changes, the
Leviathan shaman must
be convinced again (as
above) to go along with
the change. If the
Leviathan
shaman
achieves the highest net
successes on the test
made to convince him to
act, he declines to respond
to the call to action. Modify
the target number of any further
attempts to convince him to take
that same action by +1 per failed
attempt. If the Leviathan shaman agrees
to take action on a repeated attempt to convince him, he must subtract 2 from all Initiative rolls.
PEGASUS
In myth, Pegasus leaped full grown from the severed neck of
the gorgon Medusa. A creature of beauty born of blood, Pegasus
is wild and free. He is skittish and shy, avoiding strangers as
potential enemies, as elusive as the wind itself. He fights fiercely
against the bridle and only the bravest can earn his respect and
friendship. Pegasus is loyal to such people, but not blindly so. An
arrogant rider can still be brought low if he gets above himself.
Favored Environment: Rural area under the open sky
Advantages: +2 dice to detection and health spells; +2 dice for
conjuring Spirits of the Sky
Disadvantages: Pegasus shamans cannot bear captivity or limits on
their freedom of movement. If they voluntarily enter into a building or
enclosed area, they must make a successful Willpower (4) Test every
hour they stay inside, up to a number of hours equal to their
Willpower Attribute. If all those tests succeed, the shaman may
remain inside as long as necessary-he's sucked up his fear and
steeled his will to do what has to be done. If the shaman fails this test,
he no longer needs to make the Willpower (4) Tests to keep his composure, but must add 1 to all target numbers while he remains inside.
A Pegasus shaman involuntarily confined (imprisoned,
caught in a natural disaster, and so on) automatically suffers a +1
penalty to all target numbers. If involuntarily confined for a number of hours equal to or greater than his Willpower Attribute, the
shaman must make a Willpower (4) Test to avoid going into a
death frenzy. Magic Pool dice cannot be used for this test. If the
shaman succeeds in this test (achieves at least 1 success), he or
she need not make the test again for a number of hours equal to
the number of successs.
Failure on this test sends the Pegasus shaman into the death
frenzy, a single-minded, all-out attempt to escape. Increase all the
shaman's Attributes by 2 during the death frenzy. The Pegasus
shaman will immediately try to reach the nearest window, door, or
exit and will run over, past or through anything standing in his way.
He will not fight unless opponents try to stop him. The gamemaster secretly keeps a running total of any damage the shaman takes
during the frenzy, though neither that damage nor any penalties
apply during the frenzy. If the character's damage exceeds the
Physical column and his Body Rating, the shaman continues to live
for a number of minutes equal to his Willpower Attribute, still possessed by the frenzy, then dies. If the shaman succeeds in escaping,
the frenzy ends a number of minutes later equal to his Willpower
Attribute. All damage taken during the frenzy takes effect at that
moment. If the damage is enough to kill the shaman, he or she dies.
At his discretion and according to the demands of his game,
the gamemaster may modify the number of minutes a shaman can
survive the death frenzy. He may also choose to change the circumstances under which the shaman must resist the death frenzy.
For example, if the shaman is confined in a cage outside, trapped
only by an electrified field, or locked in a room with lots of windows, the gamemaster may judge that the shaman will take
longer to panic.
PHOENIX
Bright and proud, Phoenix symbolizes beauty and rebirth.
When the time comes for her to die, Phoenix builds her own funeral pyre of the finest materials, then ignites it in a blaze of glory. She
rises anew from the ashes to begin the cycle again, once more
young and vibrant. The song of Phoenix is legendary in its magnificence, for Phoenix is a great artist and appreciates beauty.
Favored Environment: Desert and fields
Advantages: +1 die for health and illusion spells; can conjure
Spirits of the Great Fiery Firmament (see p. 143, Tir na nÓg)
Disadvantages: Phoenix shamans are flamboyant with a flair for the
dramatic. They must assign a value of at least 4 to Charisma during
character creation. Phoenix shamans must also know a performance
skill such as a musical instrument, singing or dance, which may also
be used as a Centering Skill or geas. Finally, Phoenix shamans have
a reputation, like their totem, for rising from the ashes. They can survive physical overflow damage of Body Rating x 2. Each time the
shaman's damage overflows the Physical column of the Condition
Monitor, however, reduce the total by 1. Over time, this can effectively reduce the shaman to having no overflow at all.
UNICORN
Fierce and free, Unicorn is a creature of the wild. She is shy
and shuns the presence of man, save only the purest of heart.
Though she prefers to avoid conflict with (meta)humanity, she is a
staunch defender of the wilderness, protecting it unto death.
Unicorn cannot abide corruption, and the touch of her horn serves
as a panacea for all manner of toxins and diseases.
Favored Environment: Forest
Advantages: +2 dice for health and illusion spells; +2 dice for conjuring Spirits of the Land. Upon character creation, a Unicorn
shaman receives the Aura Reading Skill (see p. 96) at one-half his
starting Sorcery Skill Rating at no extra cost. The shaman may
increase this rating using standard skill improvement rules (p.190, SRII).
Disadvantages: Unicorn shamans must follow a strict moral code,
upholding the sacredness of the wild and all its creatures. They
will tolerate no corruption and work to root it out wherever they
may find it, even at great personal cost. Unicorn shamans must
double all Essence and Magic Attribute reductions caused by
adding cyber- or bioware to their bodies, due to its unnatural and
corrupting effects.
TOTEM CREATION
Shadowrun products offer an extensive variety of totems
from many different cultures and traditions, a selection that will
continue to expand as new areas of the Sixth World are explored
and described in future products. (See the Totem Table, p. 151, for
a complete list.) It is entirely likely, however, that some
Shadowrun players and gamemasters have concepts for totems
yet to be covered in print. This section provides guidelines for creating new totems.
Like all aspects of the mystic arts, totem creation cannot be
reduced to mere number crunching. Totem design requires as
much art as science, so do not regard these rules as hard and fast.
Gamemasters should always allow common sense and good
judgment about their own campaigns to prevail over statistics.
WHY A NEW TOTEM?
The first question the gamemaster should ask is, "Is this new
totem really necessary?" Explore the possibility that the concept
proposed by the gamemaster or player fits with an existing totem
from published Shadowrun material. If the new totem is simply a
variation of an existing totem, the gamemaster can use the game
statistics of the old totem and substitute the description of the
new totem. For example, Serpent and Wyrm are very similar figures among the Irish and Welsh druids, so their game statistics
(presented in Tir na nÓg and the London Sourcebook, respectively) are the same even though they are two distinct totems.
The gamemaster may also consider modifying existing totems
to suit the desired new totem. Gamemasters should take care not to
make the totem's advantages or disadvantages too extreme. No
totem should be inherently more or less powerful than any other.
If, after considering the above options, the gamemaster still
chooses to create or allow the creation of a new totem, he should
use the existing totems as models for constructing and balancing
the new totem.
ARCHETYPES
The totem archetype is a symbol for certain qualities, and
forms the basis of a totem's nature. For example, Coyote is an
archetypal Trickster figure, while Bear is a Healer. Some archetypes vary from one culture to another, while others remain fairly
constant. Shadowrun totems usually represent the most universal
qualities of the totem.
While creating the totem, ask what qualities the image of the
totem brings to mind. What typical feats and actions are normally associated with the image? Remember, it is not the physical,
real aspects of the archetype that are important, but the image.
The totem is not a bear or even the bear, but Bear, the mythic
archetype of all bearkind.
Use these qualities (both good and bad) to determine the
totem's nature. Is it sly and tricky like Coyote? Stern and proud
like Eagle or gentle and playful like Dolphin? These personality
traits are reflected by the totem's shamans, who must act in accordance with their totem's Way to retain their power.
Totem archetypes are generally animal figures, but other cultural archetypes will serve just as well. For example, the idols of
European nature magic (see pp. 149-151, Germany Sourcebook)
are humanlike mythological archetypes. Other magical traditions follow totems of mythical creatures or even places that have become
invested with significant meaning. The gamemaster always has final
say on whether or not a given archetype is suitable for use as a totem.
ADVANTAGES
All totems are better at some things and worse at others, so
it is only natural that the totem provides both benefits and drawbacks when called upon for magic. In general, the totem provides
a bonus die (or dice) to one spell category and for conjuring a
class or type of spirit. For example, Bear is a strong and sensitive
healer, so he provides +2 dice for health spells. Forest is Bear's
favored domain, so Bear shamans gain +2 dice for conjuring forest spirits. Do not feel confined by the dice, however; if you feel
that the realm of the totem covers more than one spell category
or should offer additional advantages, simply be sure that the disadvantages balance out. Rural Snake shamans, for example, use
+2 dice for healing, illusion and detection spells, but will not fight
except for food and in self-defense, and suffer a penalty of -1 for
spells cast during combat.
Totems may also modify certain target numbers or create
other, minor effects.
DISADVANTAGES
Just like advantages, following a totem implies certain drawbacks. Snake and Rat are not fighters, so their shamans subtract
dice from Combat spells; Wolf and Bear can go berserk when
wounded and Owl does not work well in the daylight.
Consider the qualities of the archetype to determine the
totem's weaknesses, and use these to balance out the advantages
the totem grants. Required behaviors can be drawbacks if they
sometimes hinder the shaman or are difficult to overcome (usually requiring a Willpower Test).
BALANCING IT OUT
Balance the totem's advantages and disadvantages. Totems
offering big advantages should require big drawbacks, while
totems like Coyote have no bonuses, but no disadvantages either.
If the answer to the question, "Will everyone want to play this
totem rather than any other one?" is yes, the totem is probably
too powerful and needs more or stronger disadvantages.
Likewise, if no character in his right mind would follow the totem,
it may be too weak or better suited for non-player shamans (like
the insect and toxic totems).
Be fair but firm when working out totem modifiers. Generally,
several small modifiers serve game balance better than one large
modifier. A +2 dice bonus to health and manipulation spells is far
more balanced than +4 dice to just one category.
EXAMPLES
The following examples describe the thought processes that
might go into creating a new totem. Prairie Dog and Fire-Bringer
are suitable for use as player-character totems.
Prairie Dog
A gamemaster is developing a totem based on the fictional
Prairie Dog shaman described in The Ways of Magic, p. 15.
First, the gamemaster consults the existing totem descriptions, finding that Dog and Rat are the two closest totems to the
one he wants. Unfortunately, neither is exactly what the
gamemaster has in mind for Prairie Dog-Rat is secretive, suspicious and NO FUN; Dog is loyal and friendly, but too much of a
fighter for Prairie Dog.
The gamemaster then lists all of the qualities he can think of
that embody the archetype of Prairie Dog. Prairie Dog is a community-minded, gregarious character. He is quick and playful, but
acutely aware of how vulnerable his small size makes him, and so
is always on the alert. Prairie Dog rarely fights, preferring to hide in
his intricate underground lair and stay one step ahead of predators.
With these ideas in mind, the gamemaster begins to look at
totem modifiers. He decides that the totem will provide a bonus to
detection and illusion spells, to reflect Prairie Dog's quick and nimble character. Prairie Dog is also fun-loving and gregarious, so the
gamemaster gives the shaman a bonus of +1 die for any Charismabased test. Because Prairie Dog lives in intricate tunnels under the
ground, the gamemaster also grants a small bonus for conjuring any
land-based spirits. Prairie Dog shamans suffer a penalty to combat
spells, because they consider it much easier to run than to fight.
PRAIRIE DOG
Prairie Dog is playful, fun-loving and always interested in
meeting new people to add to his family. He is not naive,
however; he keeps an eye out for potential danger and
always knows where to run and hide. In his small way,
Prairie Dog defines the Awakened world, being both suspicious and friendly, wary and welcoming.
Prairie Dog shamans make it a point of pride to
meet everyone who lives near them, whether they live
in a huge multiplex of apartments or a small rural community. They especially like to borrow and swap items,
because it gives them an excuse to talk to people. Prairie
Dog shamans will always know multiple ways to get
from one place to another. There rarely use the same
route coming and going, preferring to weave intricate
paths and patterns to and from their destinations.
Favored Environment: Any environment except water
Advantages: +2 dice for detection spells; +1 die for illusion spells; +1 die for Charisma Tests; +2 dice for conjuring Spirits of the Land
Disadvantages: - 2 dice for combat spells.
Fire-Bringer
A player is designing a shaman who uses European nature
magic, a belief system based on anthropomorphic totems known
as idols. None of the idols in the Germany Sourcebook appeal to
the player, so she decides to create a new idol based on the mythic archetype of Prometheus, the Greek Titan who gave fire to
mankind.
She begins by studying some of the myths about
Prometheus. She decides that the idol, known as the Fire-Bringer,
is a thoughtful, creative and caring archetype. He is also prone to
act without thinking and willingly goes to great lengths to uphold
his convictions, defying law and authority if necessary. As the
bearer of fire and light, he is a figure of truth, generosity and
progress. Followers of the Fire-Bringer tend to be crusaders, very
cause-driven and devoted to the ideals of truth and duty.
With a firm grasp of the idol's attributes, the player begins
looking at totem modifiers. A bonus to detection spells seems an
obvious choice for a figure devoted to truth and bringing light into
the darkness. Since the Fire-Bringer is also considered a powerful
creator and shaper, she decides the totem will offer a bonus to
manipulation spells. In most stories about the Fire-Bringer, he is
described as a great friend of humanity, so the player assigns a
bonus for conjuring Spirits of Man.
The gamemaster considers the new idol and agrees that it is
sufficiently different from the existing idols to warrant a new
totem. He suggests that the player assign a penalty to illusion
spells, since the Fire-Bringer's devotion to truth makes him a poor
deceiver. He also requires Fire-Bringer shamans to be willing to
risk their safety for the benefit of their friends and associates. The
final design of the idol appears as follows.
FIRE-BRINGER
The Fire-Bringer is the friend and ally of man. He
risked everything to steal the secret of fire from the heavens and give it to humanity as a gift and tool. He represents a figure of kindness and concern, but his good intentions sometimes get him in trouble and his plans sometimes fail to work out the way he envisioned them.
He is a shaper and creator, forming new things out of the primal clay and breathing the fiery spark of life into them.
Favored Environment: Urban
Advantages: +2 dice for detection and manipulation
spells; +2 dice for conjuring Spirits of Man
Disadvantages: - 1 die for illusion spells. Fire-Bringer
shamans selflessly devote themselves to the betterment
of others, even at the expense of their own welfare.
While a Fire-Bringer shaman is not required to sacrifice
his life for the benefit of humanity, he will generally do
anything short of making that sacrifice. Most Fire-Bringer
shamans devote themselves to some cause that they follow with great zeal.

ADEPT RULES
These rules expand the adept rules presented in Shadowrun, Second Edition, and the
Grimoire, Second Edition. In addition to describing a new adept type and offering optional
rules for playing a physical magician (an adept that can also cast spells), the Adept Rules section provides twenty-three new adept powers.
The player and gamemaster can use the development of a physical adept character's Way,
as described in the Adepts fiction section (p. 51) as a roleplaying element in the character's
growth. The player may also decide to use his adept character's Way as a foundation for building the character concept and selecting the adept's powers. The character's Way might also
help in choosing appropriate geasa for the character's powers (if desired).
ASTRAL ADEPTS
Astral adepts are standard Magic Priority B adepts who possess the ability to access the
astral plane but can perform no other magic. Astral adepts can use astral perception and astral
projection normally and may learn and use all of the magical skills associated with perception
and projection (such as Sorcery for astral combat). They cannot make active use of any other
magical skills on the physical plane (Sorcery, Conjuring or Enchanting). They can become initiates, and they gain the ability to perform astral quests and project to the metaplanes upon
doing so. The only metamagic they can use is the masking power. They can bond foci, but only
gain bonuses from power and weapon foci. Astral adepts often find applications for their talents as "clairvoyants" and trackers.
SHAMANIC PHYSICAL ADEPTS
Shamanic physical adepts use the normal rules for totems with one major exception: these
adepts do not receive Sorcery or Conjuring bonuses or penalties (because they cannot use
those skills). They must accept any applicable limitations, which may be considered nonremovable geasa for game purposes, and may receive any applicable bonuses of their chosen totem. Shamanic physical adepts also have an additional option
for initiation, a variation of the astral quest known as the vision quest (see Initiation, p. 113).
GEASA
The player of a physical adept may choose to place a geas, or
limit, on his or her character's powers. The geas may apply to one
power or many, and an adept can have more than one geas at a
time applying to different powers in combination. A player may
not apply more than one geas to a power.
A physical adept power limited by a geas costs 75 percent of
the normal Magic cost (round fractions up to the nearest quarter
point) with a minimum cost of .25 Magic Points. For example, an
adept who purchased the astral perception power with the time
geas would pay only 1.5 Magic Points (2 x .75 = 1.5). If the power
is purchased in levels, the reduction in cost is applied to the total
cost of the power. If an adept is purchasing the body control
power at Level 3, he or she would only pay 1.25 Magic Points (.5
x 3 = 1.5: 1.5 x .75 = 1.125, rounded up to 1.25).
As long as the adept adheres to the strictures of the geas, the
power works normally. In the above example, if the adept had
taken as her time geas that her astral perception power worked
only at night, the power would not function at all during the day
and would function normally after the sun had set each evening.
If the geas is broken, however, the power ceases to work at all
until the conditions of the geas are restored.
Gamemasters should carefully consider the effects of a geas
on a particular power before approving the geas for use in the
campaign. If the geas does not limit the use of the power in some
way (such as a geas that requires the adept to be touching the
ground in order to use the rooting power), the gamemaster
should ask the player to choose a different geas.
Part of the fun of the geasa concept is that gamemasters can
occasionally exploit the characters' geasa in adventures. A physical adept may choose to accept a domain (city) geas on all of his
powers and take advantage of the lower cost to load up on extra
magical goodies, but what's the poor fragger to do when a run
unexpectedly takes him out of the 'plex and into tribal territorywhere none of his powers work?
CONDITION GEAS
The adept must achieve a specific state in order to use a
power with this geas; e.g., being drunk, touching natural Earth, or
meditating. If the adept is not in that state, the power does not
work. Note that this geas cannot be applied to a power if the geas
is something that must be done already to invoke the power (i.e.,
an adept could not take a geas on his suspended state power that
required him to be motionless in order to use it, because motionlessness is already part of the power).
DOMAIN GEAS
A power limited by a domain geas only works in a specific
domain or environment (e.g., city, forest, or building interior).
Most shadowrunners choose the domain geas of city, while many
shamanic physical adepts select their totem's favored environment as the place where their power is greatest. A common version of this geas limits the power to working within the confines
of the adept's homeland or native city.
FASTING GEAS
Whenever the adept eats or drinks, a power limited by the
fasting geas ceases to function for 24 hours. In order to make
effective use of this power, an adept must plan ahead.
GESTURE GEAS
To make use of a power limited by the gesture geas, the
adept must perform visible magical gestures, having both hands
and arms free to move. These gestures might be part of a special
martial arts kata or similar to the mystical kuji-kiri gestures used
by the ninja, but they are obviously magical and cannot be hidden. The gestures require a Free Action to perform during combat. Note that an attack, no matter how graceful or well choreographed, does not count for this geas.
INCANTATION GEAS
To use a power limited by the incantation geas, the adept
must be able to speak, sing, chant or make some other sound in
a clear, firm voice. The incantation is clearly magical and cannot be
hidden. It can be anything from a battle shout to a mystical war
chant, martial arts kiai or a song, and it requires one Free Action
to use during combat. If the adept is unable to speak the incantation, the geas is broken and the power does not function.
SACRIFICE GEAS
As stated in Grimore II, ONLY non-player characters may use
this geas.
TALISMAN GEAS
The adept needs a physical focus or fetish to use a power limited by the talisman geas. This item must be fairly specific, with at
least three defining characteristics (i.e., a flat stone about the size
of a quarter veined with red). This prevents an adept with the
improved armed combat power from simply taking "a weapon"
or even "a sword" as a talisman; he must designate a more specific weapon. For example, a samurai adept might only have use
of the improved armed combat power while wielding his family's
ancestral katana. A Native American might fulfill this geas by only
using a self-crafted bow to practice her improved projectile
weapons power.
If the adept is unable to touch, use or wield the talisman, the
geas is broken. If the talisman is lost or destroyed, the geas is broken until the adept can regain it or acquire another one. If the talisman is unique and it is lost or destroyed, the adept loses the
power(s) associated with this geas permanently.
TIME GEAS
The power limited by the time geas only works during the
day or night or during one season of the year. The rest of the time,
the power does not function. "Day" or "night" can be defined as
any roughly 12-hour period, but should be consistent (e.g., sunrise to sunset or noon to midnight). The gamemaster may allow
other types of time geasa, such as lunar based (the power only
functions while the moon is either waxing or waning) or even
astrological. As a general guideline, the time geas should render
the power useless about half the time.
MAGICAL GROUPS
As noted in the Grimoire II, physical adepts can join magical
groups in the same manner as other magicians and gain the same
benefits from membership. If a magical group admits physical
adepts along with other types of magicians, add 2 to the target
number for the group's test for creating an astral contact. This
penalty does not apply if all the physical adepts joining the group
are required to have the astral perception power, which allows
the adept(s) to be more than "astral dead weight" in making the
Contact Test. The penalty also does not apply if the group admits
only physical adepts, because they all have a similar magical paradigm.
INITIATION
While physical adepts may undergo initiation individually or
in groups, certain differences exist between adept initiates and
initiates of other magical disciplines.
ORDEALS
Physical adepts may use the following types of ordeals for
initiation. The text describes any differences between the adept
version of these ordeals and the ordeals used by other magicians. Physical adepts submitting to an ordeal receive the same
Karma cost reductions as other magical characters (see p. 38,
Grimoire II).
Asceticism
Due to their greater emphasis on physical development,
physical adepts rarely take the asceticism ordeal, though some
adepts who do not concentrate on physical development, such as
mystics and "ghost hunters," have been known to do so. This
ordeal may involve arduous ritual combat or tests of endurance.
The attribute reduced as a requirement for this ordeal cannot benefit from the increased physical attributes power, though the character can apply the attribute boost power to this attribute.
Deed
All physical adepts may perform the deed ordeal, and may submit to the deed ordeal more than once. When the adept submits to this ordeal, he must forfeit any Karma award for the adventure in which the deed takes place.
Familiar
Physical adepts cannot undergo the familiar ordeal, because they cannot conjure ally spirits. Physical magicians may submit to this ordeal, but they must deduct the Magic Point spent to conjure the ally spirit from their effective Magic Attribute (see Physical Magicians, p. 119).
Geas
A physical adept may accept a geas as an ordeal for initiation.
This geas affects one or more of the adept's existing powers
whose total cost equals .5 Magic Points. Accepting an ordeal geas
does not affect the initial cost of the power(s) (the cost cannot be
reduced retroactively), and this geas cannot be removed through
further initiation.
Physical magicians may submit to the geas ordeal either by
limiting their adept powers as above or by taking a geas that
applies to all of their active magical skills (Sorcery, Conjuring and
Enchanting). This is in addition to any geasa the physical magician
is required to have based on his effective Magic Attribute. The
geas accepted as an ordeal cannot be shed through initiation (see
Physical Magicians, p. 119).
Meditation
Physical adepts may submit to the meditation ordeal, but
characters who focus on physical development (i.e., they were
created with higher Physical Attributes) sometimes find this
ordeal extremely difficult. The adept may use improved attribute
power bonuses when making the Meditation Tests, but may not
take advantage of the boosted attribute power.
Oath
Many magical groups made up mainly or partially of physical
adepts require that new members submit to the oath ordeal. This
is particularly true of secretive organizations such as the Oni-do
ninja or Tir Tairngire's Paladins.
Thesis
The gamemaster may choose to allow a physical adept to
prepare an alternate sort of thesis that serves as a master treatise
on the character's area of specialization, such as Miyamoto
Mushashi's Go-Rin-No-Sho (A Book of Five Rings), a treatise on
the art of swordsmanship. The thesis encompasses the adept's
magical world view and all of his knowledge of his Way. The thesis may be a book or other text, a complex work of art, a masterfully crafted weapon, or any other work that the gamemaster
approves.
Use the appropriate skill (Athletics, Military Theory, Armed
Combat B/R, and so on) with a Target Number of 5 and a base
time of 30 days, divided by the number of successes. No successes indicates that preparation of the thesis takes twice the base
time. The thesis can be worked on in smaller segments of time if
the character wishes.
A thesis prepared by a physical adept has all of the properties of
an ordeal thesis prepared by a magician. The thesis acts as an astral
link to its creator, and if all copies of the thesis are destroyed, the creator immediately loses 1 point of Magic (with an equivalent loss in
powers, in the case of an adept). The powers lost should generally be
ones closely related to the thesis, if possible. For example, if the thesis is a complex philosophical study of unarmed combat techniques,
the adept should lose one level (or more) of the improved unarmed
combat power if the thesis is destroyed. If no particular power seems
appropriate, the gamemaster should choose 1 Magic Point worth of
abilities at random to remove from the adept character.
Vision Quest
Only shamanic physical adepts may perform this variation of
the astral quest ordeal (see Shamanic Physical Adept, p. 110).
Generally, the adept must meditate and fast in solitude in his
totem's favored environment for as many days as the desired
grade of initiation + 1. Follow the standard rules for the astral
quest ordeal. The adept cannot perform the vision quest for any
purpose other than initiation and, as with other ordeals, the vision
quest may only be undertaken once.
REMOVING GEASA
Unless specifically stated otherwise (as in the case of ordeal
geasa), a physical adept can choose to drop a geas from one of his
powers upon achieving a new initiate grade. The adept must immediately be able to pay for the cost difference in Magic Points upon
achieving the new grade. If the adept possesses the required
amount of good Karma, the geas disappears and the adept may use
the power without restriction. If the adept has a geas that applies to
multiple powers it can be shed from one power at a time. If the
adept does not have sufficient Magic Points from one initiation to
remove the geas, the limitation remains until the character has
enough Karma Points to "pay off" the geas. A physical adept may
only shed one geas from one power per grade of initiation.
A shamanic physical adept cannot remove a totem-based geas.
METAMAGIC
Physical adept initiates can use the metamagical abilities of
masking and centering. Physical adept initiates with the astral perception power gain a special Astral Pool equal to their initiate
grade which can be used for Astral Tests.
Masking
All physical adept initiates may mask their auras to appear as
mundanes or non-initiate physical adepts. Adepts who possess
the astral perception power may also attempt to penetrate the
masking of others per the standard Grimoire II rules. Physical
adepts can also use deliberate masking to conceal foci and to penetrate attuned wards.
Centering (Optional Rule)
The gamemaster may allow an adept initiate to use centering to resist the Drain caused by the boost attribute power.
Physical adepts may choose from a broad variety of Centering
Skills, but the gamemaster should not allow an adept initiate to
use any Combat or Athletics skill as a Centering Skill (as stated
in Grimoire II, Centering Skills should not have much practical
application outside of helping the adept focus). Some common
Centering Skills for physical adepts appear in the Adepts fiction
section, p. 55.
FOCI
Physical adepts may use weapon foci and the centering focus
described on page 103 of the Rules section. They lack the necessary magical abilities to use any other type of foci. Physical adepts
cannot make foci, but may bond suitable foci that they acquire.

ESCAPE ARTIST (NEW SKILL)
The Escape Artist Special Skill is a Concentration of the
Athletic Skill that allows the user to escape from restraints and
confinement such as ropes, handcuffs and other bindings by
means of contortion and manual dexterity. The difficulty for an
Escape Artist Test is based on the complexity of the restraints, as
shown on the Escape Table, below.
ESCAPE TABLE
||Restraint||Target Number||
|Ropes|4|
|Handcuffs|6|
|Straitjacket|8|
|Containment Manacles|10|

The base time to escape is 5 times the target number in minutes. If the Escape Artist Test succeeds, the character will escape
is a number of minutes equal to the base time divided by the
number of successes. A failure means that the character cannot
break free. The character can try again after the base time has
expired. For example, if a character tries to break free of handcuffs
and fails, he can try again after 30 minutes.
Physical adepts with the pain resistance power gain an
additional advantage in using this skill because they can safely
dislocate joints and twist them in otherwise painful contortions.
The ability to resist each Wound level reduces the target number of the Escape Artist Test by 1. For example, an adept who
can resist up to Moderate damage may subtract 2 from the target number, an adept who can resist Serious damage may subtract 3, and so on. Any use of the pain resistance power to
counter penalties from injuries that the adept currently suffers
does not count toward this bonus. Physical adepts with the flexibility power subtract 1 from the Escape Artist Test target number.
Toshi is captured and worked over by some corporate goons, then slapped into handcuffs and locked up.
Toshi has Escape Artist 5 and 4 levels of the pain resistance power. He is currently suffering from Moderate
Stun damage. His Target Number to escape from the
handcuffs would normally be 8 (6, plus the damage modifier). Toshi has enough pain resistance power to negate
the effects of the damage, reducing the Target Number
to 6. Toshi can also ignore an additional Light level of
damage, and so he subtracts 1 more from his target
number, making it a 5. He scores 1 success on his Escape
Artist Test and works his way out of the cuffs in 5 minutes. Toshi then begins planning how to get out of the
cell to pay back the corp goons.
LEARNING PHYSICAL ADEPT POWERS
The current Shadowrun rules place no limits on physical
adepts who wish to purchase new abilities with Magic Points
gained through initiation. The player simply states which new
power he wants to give his character and spends the appropriate
number of Magic Points.
For purposes of game balance, gamemasters may wish to
limit access to some physical adept abilities (such as the new
ones listed in this book, as well as those in Grimoire, Second
Edition). The gamemaster may simply rule that certain physical
adept powers can only be gained by learning them from an
experienced user. This tack would allow some adepts to possess
abilities limited to them or members of their magical group.
Gaining such exclusive powers would require the adept to seek
out a suitable instructor who is also willing to teach the power.
Searching for a teacher and offering him or her an appropriate
reward for sharing the secrets of his or her powers may become
a quest used as the basis for adventures-as well as allowing the
gamemaster to integrate new powers into his campaign at his
own pace.
The gamemaster may also simply limit the list of abilities from
which players may choose for their physical adept characters during character creation. These powers might be presented as the
abilities of the "higher mysteries," powers that cannot be gained
until after play begins, when the physical adept has earned some
Karma and (hopefully) wisdom.
NEW PHYSICAL ADEPT POWERS
BLIND FIGHTING
Cost: . 5
Physical adepts with the blind fighting power possess a mystical "sixth sense" that allows them to function more effectively in
darkness or under other conditions in which the adept is unable to
see (such as being blindfolded). The blind fighting power reduces
the visibility penalty (blind fire, full darkness) to +4. Targets
attacked by an adept using this power still gain the normal bonuses from cover.
COUNTERSTRIKE
Cost: . 5 per level
The counterstrike power gives the adept a particularly strong
ability to strike back at attackers. For each level of the power, the
adept rolls an additional die for Counterattack Tests in melee combat, either armed or unarmed. These dice can only be used for
counterattacks, not for damage resistance or any other type of
attack.
DELAY DAMAGE
Cost: 2.5
The delay damage power allows a physical adept to inflict
damage in unarmed melee combat that does not take immediate
effect. Before making his attack, the adept declares the use of the
delay damage power and then makes a normal Attack Test
against the target. The target makes a Damage Resistance Test as
normal.
If the attack is successful and the target does not completely
resist the damage, the delay damage power converts the attack
into a "charge" of astral force that lingers in the target's aura for
up to 24 hours. After a predetermined period, defined by the
adept when the attack is made, the damage from the attack (Stun
or Physical, per the standard rules for the attack) takes effect
against the target as if the attack had occurred that instant.
Once the delayed damage attack has been set in motion, it
requires no further attention or effort from the adept. A target can
only be under the effects of one delay damage attack at any given
time. Anyone who observes the target of a delay damage attack
in astral space will see the magical charge in the target's aura. The
charge can be removed before it takes effect by making a
Dispelling Test against a target number equal to the Power of the
attack, with a Drain equal to the attack's damage code.
Physical adept assassins with the delay damage and killing
hands powers are capable of striking a victim with the confidence
that the target will die hours later, when the adept has secured an
alibi hundreds of miles away.

DISTANCE STRIKE
Cost: 2
The distance strike power allows a physical adept to use the
medium of astral space to make an unarmed attack over a short
distance and strike a target without physically touching the target.
The power has a range in meters equal to the adept's Magic
Attribute and inflicts the standard damage for an unarmed attack.
To use the distance strike power, the adept makes an Unarmed
Combat Test as normal, ignoring Reach modifiers. The target uses
Combat Pool dice and Body to resist the attack as a ranged attack;
in other words, the target cannot counterattack, and if the target
rolls more successes on his Combat Pool or Threat Rating dice
than the attacker's successes, the attack is a complete miss.
Falcon uses his distance strike power against a corporate guard. Falcon rolls his Unarmed Combat of 6, plus
4 Combat Pool dice, against a Target Number of 4, gaining 6 successes. The guard makes his Damage Resistance
Test using his 4 Body dice plus 5 Combat Pool dice
against Falcon's Strength of 5 modified by his own 2
points of Impact armor for a Target Number of 3, earning
6 successes. Falcon's killing hands do a base 5M damage,
so the guard takes a Moderate wound.
If an adept possesses either the killing hands power or the
distance strike power and wishes to purchase the other, double
the cost of the second power purchased. For example, Falcon's
player purchases the killing hands power for that character at character creation. At initiate Grade 1, if the player wants to purchase
the distance strike power, it will cost 4 Magic Points.
EMPATHIC SENSE
Cost: . 5
The empathic sense ability gives an adept a limited form of
astral awareness that allows him to sense the feelings of those
around him, to a range of the adept's unaided line of sight. The
adept makes a Perception (4) Test to gain a general impression of
a subject's current emotions (love, anger, fear, and so on). The
greater the number of successes, the more detailed the information the adept learns. Metamagical masking can defeat this
power, but if the adept using the empathic sense power is also an
initiate, resolve an attempt to penetrate the masking normally.
ENHANCED COORDINATION
Cost: . 25 per level
An adept with the enhanced coordination power may use both
hands equally well. Each level of this power counts as 1 level in the
Ambidexterity Special Skill (see Off-Hand Training, p. 81, Fields of
Fire). The adept must have at least 1 level in the Ambidexterity Skill in
order to buy this power, and may not have more levels in the enhanced
coordination power than he has levels in the Ambidexterity Skill.
FLEXIBILITY
Cost: . 25 per level
The flexibility power makes an adept's limbs unusually limber,
able to twist and bend more than a normal person's. For each
level of this power, the adept may add 1 die to tests made to slip
out of ropes, handcuffs and other such bindings as well as tests
made to escape from a hold in unarmed combat. The adept can
also make Flexibility Tests to squeeze through small openings and
passages that would be difficult for a normal person of the character's size to fit through, such as transoms, ventilation ducts, and
other close quarters. The gamemaster may determine appropriate
target numbers for such tests.
FREEFALL
Cost: . 25 per level
For each level of the freefall power, the adept can fall a distance of 2 meters without suffering injury or making a Damage
Resistance Test, provided that the surface the adept falls onto is
not in itself dangerous. If the adept falls a distance greater than
the allowance of the freefall power, subtract the maximum distance cushioned by the power from the distance fallen before calculating damage. If the adept falls onto a dangerous surface-an
alley covered with shards of glass or a burning floor, for example-he can still use the freefall power to avoid falling damage,
but will take damage dependent on the surface and the
gamemaster's discretion.
IMPROVED PHYSICAL SENSES
Cost: . 25 per improvement
The improved physical senses power is described on page
125, SRII. The following information offers specific variations of
this power. Use the Perception and Success tables as guidelines
for Perception Test target numbers and information gained per
success in using the improved physical senses power.
Direction Sense: An adept with an improved physical sense
of direction almost never gets lost and can easily retrace his own
steps. He can almost always tell what direction he is facing.
whether above or below the local ground level. This ability is
especially useful for tribal hunters, guides, spies and runners who
pursue other, similar occupations.

PERCEPTION TABLE
||Condition||Target Number||
|Subject in line of sight|4|
|Subject beyond visible/sensor range|6|
|Subject present only in astral space|10|

SUCCESS TABLE
||Successes||Results||
|1|General information, no details|
|2|Minor details with some inaccuracies|
|3|All details accurate, some minor details obscure|
|4|Complete, detailed information|


Flare Compensation: 
The adept's eyes adapt quickly to intense light, allowing him to avoid long-term damage from flash
grenades and similar weapons. The flare compensation power functions exactly like the cybernetic version of flare compensation. Reduce the effects of BrightLight flash-paks (p. 46, Cybertechnology) by half.
High-Frequency Hearing: The adept can hear sounds of a
higher pitch than normal human hearing, such as dog whistles
and those ultrasonics used in rangefinders and targeting devices.
Improved Scent: Adepts with the improved scent power can
identify scents in much the same way as a bloodhound. They can
identify individuals by scent alone, and can tell if someone whose
scent they know has been in an area recently. The strong smells
of most sprawls may dampen or confuse this ability.
Improved Taste: The adept can recognize the ingredients of
food or beverage by taste alone. A successful Perception Test
allows characters with the Chemistry, Physical Sciences or related
skills to identify ingestive poisons and drugs concealed in food or
drink. A successful Perception (3) Test allows adepts with the
Survival Skill and the improved taste power to determine if a sample of water is pure enough to drink."
Low-Frequency Hearing: The adept can hear sounds of a
lower pitch than normal human hearing.
Sound Dampening: The adept's ears are protected from loud
noises and adjust quickly to sudden changes in the ambient noise
level. The sound dampening power functions exactly like the
cybernetic damper enhancement.
IRON WILL
Cost: . 5 per level
The iron will power makes an adept's will exceptionally resistant to outside influence. For each level of this power, the adept
rolls an additional die when resisting any attempt to control,
affect or alter his mind. This power does not defend against manabased combat spells.
MAGIC RESISTANCE
Cost: 1 per level
An adept with the magic resistance power possesses a
strong, unconscious resistance to sorcery. In the same manner as
initiates who possess spell defense, the character adds 1 die per
level of this power to Resistance Tests made against spells. Only
the adept may use these dice; he cannot give extra protection
against sorcery to others. The magic resistance power does not
interfere with spells accepted voluntarily and does not defend
against critter powers. If a physical magician with the magic resistance power attempts to make active use of the Sorcery Skill for
casting spells, subtract 1 die from the character's Magic Pool per
level of the power to represent the interference caused by the
character's general resistance to the magical energies. Initiate
physical adepts who possess this power do not gain the benefits
of shielding.

MAGIC SENSE
Cost: 1
The magic sense power offers a limited form of astral awareness that allows an adept to sense magical energies and effects
within a radius equal to the adept's Magic Attribute x 5 in meters.
The adept is astrally active while using this power, open to
the energies of astral space and therefore vulnerable to astral
attack. If the adept does not have astral perception, he is incapable of defending against astral attack and must simply take his
chances. The adept may use a Free Action to "turn off" his magic
sense power, at which point the adept is no longer astrally active.
The magic sense power cannot be activated and deactivated in the same Combat Phase.
MISSILE MASTERY
Cost: 1
An adept with the missile mastery power possesses such a
highly developed talent for throwing weapons that, in his hands,
normally harmless items such as pens, credsticks and ID cards
become deadly weapons. Adepts make attacks with such items
using Throwing Skill. Unorthodox missiles such as pens have a
base Damage Code of (one-half adept's Strength, rounded
down)L. Impact armor resists damage from such missiles. Items
with an edge or point inflict Physical damage, while blunt objects
do Stun damage. Adepts using the missile mastery power to
throw standard missile weapons, such as shuriken and throwing
knives, add 2 to the weapon's Power Level.
NERVE STRIKE
Cost: 1
The nerve strike power allows an adept to magically inflict
damage that affects a target's nervous system. To use the nerve
strike power, the adept makes a standard unarmed melee attack,
using the Unarmed Combat Skill against a base Target Number of
4 modified by the target's armor. Rather than inflicting damage,
for every 2 net successes gained in the adept's Unarmed Combat
Test, reduce the target's Quickness Rating by 1. If the target's
Quickness is reduced to 0, the target is paralyzed. Quickness lost
in this fashion is recovered at a rate of 1 point per minute. The
nerve strike power is only completely effective against
(meta)human opponents. When used against critters, the base
Target Number is 6 (or higher, if the gamemaster determines that
the critter has an unusual anatomy). Targets that lack functional
nervous systems, such as machines, spirits and zombies, are
immune to this power.
QUICK DRAW
Cost: 3
The quick draw power allows an adept to draw and use a single melee weapon or firearm in one action. In other words, the
adept need not spend 2 actions to draw and ready the weapon and
attack; drawing the weapon and the attack occur in the action used
for the Attack Test. If using a weapon requires a Complex Action,
the adept may draw the weapon and attack in a single phase. If the
weapon requires only a Simple Action to use, the adept can draw it
and make 2 Attack Tests in a single Combat Phase. If the character
wants to use the quick draw power for both firearms and melee
weapons, he or she needs to buy the power twice.
Note: Because the quick draw power almost certainly will
unbalance the game, the gamemaster may choose not to add it to
his campaign. If both the gamemaster and players agree to add
the quick draw power to their game, the gamemaster may
increase the cost as a way to maintain game balance.
QUICK STRIKE
Cost: . 25 per level
Physical adepts with the quick strike power seem to possess
a supernatural ability to leap into action with startling suddenness.
Each level of the power allows the adept to roll an additional die
when making Reaction Tests for Surprise against an opponent.
These dice do not apply to tests made by the adept to avoid being
surprised or for any other type of Reaction Test or Initiative roll.
RAPID HEALING
Cost: . 5 per level
The adept recovers more quickly than normal from all forms
of injury, using magical energy to boost the healing process. Each
level of the power adds 1 die to the adept's Body Attribute for
purposes of Healing Tests as well as Body Tests made to determine if the adept suffers a crippling injury from a Deadly wound.
The rapid healing power does not increase resistance to injury,
toxins or pathogens, but does allow the adept to recover from
their effects more quickly. The rapid healing power cannot counteract possible magic loss due to Deadly wounds, the effects of
goblinization, or incurable diseases such as cancer or HMHVV.
ROOTING
Cost: . 25 per level
The rooting power allows the adept, by spending a Simple
Action and concentrating for a moment, to extend the force of his
aura to "root" himself to the ground and become an immovable
object. Each level of the power adds 1 die to all tests the adept
makes to resist being knocked down, thrown, levitated or otherwise moved against his will. The adept cannot move while using
this power, but can otherwise act normally (including making
attacks), modifying all target numbers by +2.
SIXTH SENSE
Cost: 3
The sixth sense power gives an adept a magical ability to
sense immedlate personal danger. When potential danger threatens, the gamemaster makes a secret Perception Test using the
adept's Intelligence against a target number based on how obviously the danger stands out: 4 for threats in the adept's line of
sight (such as someone about to pull a gun), 6 for threats beyond
the line of sight (such as a concealed sniper or trap) and 10 for
threats in astral space (such as a spirit or ritual sending). A successful test gives the adept a general feeling of danger, and he
cannot be Surprised by the threat. The adept does not learn the
nature of the threat, only how near or far away it lies and the relative level of danger. The adept can only sense dangers that
threaten personal harm.
Note: Because the sixth sense power almost certainly will
unbalance the game, the gamemaster may choose not to add it to
his campaign. If both the gamemaster and players agree to add
the sixth sense power to their game, the gamemaster may
increase the cost as a way to maintain game balance.
SMASHING BLOW
Cost: 1
The smashing blow power allows an adept to focus magical
energy into a devastating strike designed to smash through barriers. The adept makes an Unarmed Combat Test against the Barrier
Rating of the target. Add the successes to the adept's Strength
and compare the result to the unmodified Barrier Rating, determining the effect according to the Barrier Effect Table, p. 98, SRII.
This power can be devastating when combined with the increased
strength or strength boost powers.
Slash 'n' Burn needs to get through a door that
has a Barrier Rating of 6. He takes a moment to concentrate and focus his inner energies, then with a
mighty rebel yell strikes the door with a smashing
blow. Slash's player rolls his Unarmed Combat of 6
against a base Target Number of 4 (the gamemaster
decides there are no modifiers). He generates 3 successes. Added to Slash's Strength of 5, the result of 8
reduces the Barrier Rating of the door by 1. Slash's
next roll generates 4 successes for a total of 9. Because
that result is more than 1.5 times the reduced Barrier
Rating, the door's rating is reduced to 4 and Slash
punches a half-meter wide opening in it.
SPELL SHROUD
Cost: . 25 per level
Adepts with the spell shroud power possess the ability to
"cloak" their presence in astral space, making them difficult to
detect by spells designed to do so. For every level of the power,
the adept adds 1 die to Resistance Tests against detection spells
only. If the spell cannot be resisted, increase the target number to
detect the adept by 1 for every 2 levels of the spell shroud power.
Note that his power does not affect Masking Tests and attempts
to read the subject's aura via astral perception or otherwise spot
the character in astral space.
TEMPERATURE TOLERANCE
Cost: . 25 per level
The adept's body is exceptionally resistant to extremes of
heat and cold. For each level of the temperature tolerance power,
the adept gains an additional die for resisting the effects of exposure to extreme temperatures. This power does not protect the
adept from exposure to physically harming agents such as open
flames or the freezing cold of the Antarctic Ocean, but will help
the character resist the effects of sources of extreme heat such as
burning coals, heatstroke and sunburn, as well as frostbite and
exposure to below-zero temperatures.
TRACELESS WALK
Cost: . 5
An adept with the traceless walk power possesses a very limited form of magical levitation that allows him to move over soft
or brittle surfaces like snow, sand or thin paper without leaving
any visible traces of his passage. If the adept with this power
makes a successful Stealth Test, he can walk across nightingale
floors (designed to creak when walked on) without a sound and
will not even trip ground-based motion/vibration sensors. The
adept cannot walk across liquid surfaces (but can cross deep snow
without sinking) and can still be tracked by means other than visual cues, such as scent.
PHYSICAL MAGICIANS
(OPTIONAL RULE)
Gamemasters may wish to limit physical magicians to nonplayer characters.
Physical magicians are Magic Priority A characters that follow
a different path from most other magicians. Rather than devoting
all their time to studying ways to control the energies of astral
space, physical magicians channel some of their magical ability
into improving their physical abilities in the same manner as physical adepts, while honing the rest of their magical talent on traditional magical skills such as Sorcery and Conjuring.
The physical magician character spends Magic Attribute
Points on physical adept powers according to the standard
Shadowrun rules, but must allocate at least 1 point to his Magic
Attribute Rating for using magical skills (Sorcery, Conjuring and
Enchanting).
She Who Knows the Night is a physical magician.
She spends 4 points of her initial Magic Attribute to purchase the adept powers improved stealth, combat
sense, improved unarmed combat and killing hands. The
remaining 2 points she treats as her Magic Rating when
using magic skills for casting spells or summoning spirits. If she casts spells with a Force greater than 2, She
Who Knows risks Physical damage from the Drain.
As with physical adepts, Magic Points allocated cannot be
changed. Additional Magic Attribute Points gained through initiation can be applied to either new adept powers or to raise the
character's Magic Attribute, but such points cannot be "split up,"
putting half a point into a power and the remaining half toward
the Magic Attribute. The point must be allocated to one or the
other, and the character must decide how to use the Magic Point
before attaining the new grade.
If a physical magician suffers magic loss from cyberware,
Deadly wounds or Essence loss, subtract the lost points from
those set aside for the character's magical skills first. If magic loss
reduces the adept's effective Magic Attribute to 0, the character
permanently loses the ability to make active use of magical skills.
The character may still take initiate grades and buy new powers,
but the delicate balance that allowed him or her to use active
magic is gone. Treat the character as a normal physical adept from
that point on.
Physical magicians must use their magical skills within either
the shamanic or hermetic tradition. Shamanic physical magicians
follow totems and use totem modifiers just like standard shamans
and shamanic adepts. Physical magicians purchase and use physical adept powers in the same manner regardless of tradition.
Like other magicians, physical magicians must submit to a
geas on their use of magical skills for every 2 points of Magic
Attribute lost as normal, and for every 2 points allocated to physical adept powers at character creation. The character may choose
not to take geasa, but that means he can never become an initiate or else loses any current initiate grades.
Physical magicians may also submit to geasa on their adept
powers, in the same way as physical adepts (see Geasa, p. 112).
Because they focus so much of their talent on the physical
aspect of magic, physical magicians begin without access to astral
space. They may purchase and use the adept power of astral perception normally, but can never use astral projection. If they purchase the astral perception power, physical magicians may use all
the metamagical abilities. If they choose not to purchase that
power, they may only use masking.
Physical magicians with the astral perception power can use
centering in the same way as other magicians. Physical magicians
without astral perception may purchase the physical adept power
of enhanced centering in order to use centering for physical and
other types of skills.
Physical magicians may bond and use foci normally. The
additional Magic Attribute the character gains from using a power
focus only enhances the physical magician's effective Magic
Attribute, not his or her adept powers.

In Shadowrun, voudoun is an actively practiced version of the shamanic tradition. Instead
of following one of the animal totems of standard shamanism, the practitioner of voudoun
believes in and is guided by various mystical beings, much like the idols of European nature
magic (pp. 134-35, Germany Sourcebook, and the Totem Table, pp. 151-155). These beings,
called loa, are seen as deities; like the ancient Greek and Norse gods, they represent the personification of beliefs and qualities rather than living beings.
The relationship between the voudoun shaman (the houngan) and his or her patron loa
(the mait tete) is similar to that between a shaman and his or her totem, though there are some
important differences. First, a houngan may contact and gain benefits from a loa other than his
mait tete, something unheard-of in traditional shamanism (see Contacting New Loa, p. 125).
Second, the loa demand payment for their services, a tribute that can take many forms (see
About the Loa, below). Finally-in the most dramatic difference between voudoun and traditional shamanism-the loa actually inhabits the houngan's body when called. This process,
called "mounting" or "riding," allows the loa to interact with the physical world (see Calling
the Loa, p. 124).
The following rules modify the standard Shadowrun shamanic magic rules for use with
voudoun. Unless otherwise stated, all magic rules from the Shadowrun, Second Edition, rulebook and the Grimoire, Second Edition (Grimoire II), apply to voudoun.
ABOUT THE LOA
This section describes the various loa of the voudoun tradition in Shadowrun game terms.
Except for their ability to manifest through their followers, the loa function exactly like totems
(p. 119, SRII). Each entry describes the loa and its general area of influence, what happens
when it manifests, its mait tete powers, and the gifts it bestows. For information on calculating
specific gifts, see Calculating Loa Gifts, p. 123. In addition to the major loa described below,
a houngan can also call "bought loa" (see Bought Loa, p. 124) and conjure work loa (see
Conjuring Work Loa. p. 127).
In the following entries, Manifestation describes how the loa
appears when it mounts a follower. Mait Tete describes the bonuses granted to a houngan who has a specific loa as a patron; the
houngan retains these powers as long as he or she keeps that loa
as a mait tete. The houngan may use mait tete bonus dice for dealing with spirits when making any test involving that type of spirit, including Banishing and Resistance tests against the spirit's
powers. The mait tete is selected during character creation just
like a totem, and the various advantages listed function like normal totem advantages. A houngan cannot change his or her mait
tete loa, though it is possible for a houngan to lose
contact with all the loa including his or her mait tete (see Unwilling Possession, p. 131). Gifts
describes the abilities that
the presence of the loa
enhances; the loa's host
loses these special powers
when the loa dismounts.
Finally, Petro Rite gives the
name of the Petro version
of each loa and describes
its sphere of influence.
Keep in mind that the
loa are powerful beings
with almost total control
over those they mount. A
houngan or serviteur who
fails to demonstrate the
proper respect for the loa
or treats them like servants to be ordered around will quickly suffer their displeasure
(see Unwilling Possession).

AGWE
Agwe is like the Sea he rules: strong and gentle, but capable
of sudden violence. He is proud and takes his role as a ruler seriously. Rituals to honor Agwe tend to be involved and complex
affairs, and the loa's followers are often capable diplomats and
gracious hosts.
Manifestation: Agwe's mounts act in a regal and dignified manner. To reflect Agwe's role as Ruler of the Sea, the mount must
immediately splash himself or immerse himself in water. Agwe
will remain only as long as the mount is wet. He has been known
to spontaneously mount followers who find themselves in danger
in or on the sea.
Mait Tete: Those with Agwe as their mait tete gain +2 dice for illusion spells and +2 dice for banishing water spirits.
Gifts: Agwe increases his mount's Body and Charisma, as well as
Swimming Skill and all Social skills.
Petro Rite: Agwe retains the same name, but his sphere of influence is the dark and destructive sea.
AZACA
The eager "younger brother" of the other loa, Azaca is concerned with the growth and prosperity of the land, especially cultivated land. Followers of Azaca tend to be rural caretakers of
farming communities and the like.
Manifestation: He tends toward impulsive behavior, and mounts
must make a Willpower Test to restrain the loa's exuberance
enough to follow carefully laid plans and strategies.
Malt Tete: As a mait tete loa, Azaca grants +2 dice for casting
health spells and +2 dice for banishing Spirits of the Land.
Gifts: Azaca increases his
mount's Quickness and
Body, as well as enhancing
Stealth (in rural areas only)
and all skills dealing with
plant life, woodcraft or agriculture.
Petro Rite: None.
DAMBALLAH WEDO
This ancient, primal loa
harkens back to voudoun's
African origins. Damballah
Wedo (usually known simply as Damballah) often
moves with slow dignity
and grace, but can react
with surprising suddenness
if required to do so.
Damballah is often difficult
to communicate with and
couches his wisdom in
metaphor and riddles.
Manifestation: Damballah
is the least human of the
loa. Those mounted by him
act like snakes, writhing on
the ground, hissing and
often climbing trees.
Damballah rarely speaks in any human tongue: in order to speak
and be understood normally, a houngan mounted by Damballah
must make a Willpower Test.
Mait Tete: As a mait tete loa, Damballah grants +2 dice for detection spells and +2 dice for banishing Spirits of the Air.
Gifts: Those ridden by Damballah Increase Intelligence and all
Knowledge skills.
Petro Rite: None.
ERZULIE
The loa of love and passion is both the eternal innocent and
the world-wise seductress. She is the female companion to many
of the other loa in her various manifestations, and she is loved and
desired by all. More than mere lust, Erzulie's desire is the motivating passion that drives all life.
Manifestation: Those ridden by Erzulie become sensual and
charming, gifted with incredible passion and charisma. The loa
loves gifts of fine clothes, perfumes and jewelry and prefers to
wear such things whenever possible (even if her current mount is
male).
Malt Tete: Erzulie grants +2 dice for detection and illusion spells.
Gifts: Erzulie increases her mounts' Charisma, as well as Etiquette,
Negotiation and Psychology skills.
Petro Rite: Erzulie becomes Ge-Rouge, "The Red Eyes." She
becomes the avatar of scorned love and jealous rage.
GHEDE
Dark and clever, Ghede is the most feared of all the loa. He
respects nothing and laughs at mortals' fear of the twilight that
awaits them at the end of their lives. He is a trickster and prankster
who enjoys shocking people out of their preconceptions.
Manifestation: Those ridden by Ghede demonstrate sly cleverness and a wicked sense of humor. They usually dress in the loa's
"formal" costume of top hat, black tailcoat and sunglasses, and
carry a cigarette or cigar and a cane. Anyone ridden by Ghede
must make a Willpower Test to resist an offer of food or drink.
Mait Tete: As a mait tete loa, Ghede grants +2 dice for casting
health and manipulation spells.
Gifts: Ghede increases his mounts' Intelligence, as well as Biotech
and Negotiation skills. His mounts are also immune to the effects
of pain, gaining a point of Pain Resistance equal to the manifestation's Force (as the physical adept power; see p. 126, SRII). The
mount is also immune to the effects of intoxication, though poisons or pathogens may still affect him.
Individuals mounted by Ghede suffer a penalty to all
Etiquette Test target numbers equal to the loa's Force unless the
mount makes a successful Willpower Test to restrain Ghede's sarcastic, ribald sense of humor. Reduce the penalty by 1 for each
success achieved in the Willpower Test.
Petro Rite: Ghede becomes Baron Samedi; his sphere is graveyards, evil magic and zombies.
LEGBA
Legba is the divine messenger of the loa, the opener of the
way and the boundary figure between the visible and invisible
worlds. He is the first loa invoked in ritual so that he may open the
way for the others, and is respected for his great wisdom and
authority. Followers of Legba are among the wisest of houngans.
Manifestation: Individuals mounted by Legba act like old men.
Their limbs become weak, twisted and bent, and they walk slowly and painfully. To reflect this, reduce the mounts' Movement to
1 meter per Combat Phase. In contrast to his weakened body, the
mount's voice becomes forceful and commanding, filled with wisdom and charisma.
Malt Tete: As a mait tete, Legba grants +2 dice for casting detection and manipulation spells.
Gifts: Legba increases Social and Knowledge skills, as well as
Charisma.
Petro Rite: Legba becomes Carrefour, the Abysmal Night; his
sphere is demons, night, darkness and ill chance.
LOCO AND AYIZAN
Loco and Ayizan are the First Priest and Priestess of voudoun,
raised to the status of loa. They are the archetypal masculine and
feminine. Together they are balanced, each completing the other.
Loco mounts only male houngans, Ayizan only female houngans.
Manifestation: Both Loco and Ayizan manifest subtly. It is often
difficult to realize that they have mounted at all until the mount
speaks or acts.
Mait Tete: As a mait tete, Loco grants +2 dice for detection spells
and Ayizan grants +2 dice for health spells. As the primordial
houngans, both Loco and Ayizan grant +2 dice for calling other
loa.
Gifts: Both Loco and Ayizan increase Psychology, Sociology and
Etiquette skills. Loco also increases Magical Theory and Ayizan
increases Biotech. Because they are more sympathetic to their
houngans and serviteurs than the other loa, those mounted by
Loco or Ayizan have an easier time making Willpower Tests in
order to act independently; reduce the target numbers for all such
tests by 2.
Petro Rite: None.
OGOUN
Ogoun is a direct and active force. He is power in all of its
manifestations, and he takes the most direct and simple road to
victory. Great warriors and politicians are often considered strong
in Ogoun's essence, and his followers typically do well in those
fields.
Manifestation: Ogoun's mounts act much like soldiers: marching
about, barking out orders and taking command. Even normally
weak or small people project a powerful aura of strength and
leadership when ridden by this loa. The loa's mounts usually carry
a military saber (traditional in the South) or any other type of
sword, a symbol of Ogoun that allows the loa to demonstrate his
presence by cutting the mount's skin against the sharp edge of
the sword. The blade does no damage, because Ogoun's own
iron skin protects his mount.
Malt Tete: As a mait tete, Ogoun grants +2 dice to combat and
health spells.
Gifts: Ogoun increases Strength, Reaction and Combat skills. His
mounts also gain magical armor from the loa's legendary iron
skin, which acts as Impact armor equal to the loa's Force.
Petro Rite: Ogoun becomes the Iron Warrior, avatar of violence.
CALCULATING LOA GIFTS
The loa have broad powers, but are best known for the gifts
they grant to their mounts. The loa increases a mount's skills and
Attributes according to its nature for as long as it remains mounted. Apply the bonuses listed under each loa's gifts according to
the following formula. For every 2 points of the loa's Force (round
down), increase the given Attribute and/or skills by 1 point (add
one die to those available for each given skill that the mounted
character possesses). If the mount does not possess a listed skill,
he or she gains it at a Rating of 1. Note that increases in Attributes
can exceed racial maximums and are cumulative with bonuses
from other enhancements.
Papa Jambo, a houngan with Conjuring 5, calls upon
Legba to mount him during a ritual. He chooses to call
the loa at Force 4 and rolls his 5 dice against a Target
Number of 4, coming up with 3 successes. Legba
mounts the houngan and adds 2 points to his Charisma
as well as increasing all of Papa Jambo's Knowledge and
Social skills by 2. This means that Papa Jambo rolls 2
additional dice when making any Knowledge or Social
skill test.
At the gamemaster's discretion, a character ridden by a loa
may be capable of other magical feats beyond his or her normal
abilities, depending on the Force of the loa manifestation and the
demands of the story. These could include (but are not limited to)
altering the weather, healing mortal injuries and predicting the
future. Use this device sparingly when needed to enhance the
story line (see Roleplaying the Loa, p. 130).
BOUGHT LOA
Bought loa, or loa achete, are what houngans call free spirits.
A houngan can convince a loa achete to serve by offering it some
service or payment in return, or by using the spirit's true name to
compel it (see Grimoire II, pp. 76-77). Payment is almost always an
offer of Karma to the spirit in return for its service; compelling it to
service by using its true name is a far more dangerous proposition.
At the gamemaster's discretion, a houngan can make an
astral quest to Guinee to find the true name of a bought loa, or
may invoke a loa with great knowledge, such as Legba, Ghede or
Damballah, to learn the name. No matter how it is contacted, the
loa will certainly demand a high price in exchange for such valuable information.
CALLING THE LOA
Each houngan begins with a connection to his or her mait tete
loa, with whom the houngan has the strongest bond. That loa is
considered the houngan's patron. A houngan may only call on a
loa with whom he or she has established a connection; this may
be the houngan's mait tete, but can also be other loa that the
houngan has contacted (see Contacting New Loa, p. 125). Unlike
idols or totems, the loa must be "called" or "called up." This
means conjuring the spirit of the loa to "mount" the host's body
and act through it.
To accomplish this, the gamemaster or the player of a houngan character selects a Force as the base power of the loa's manifestation in the host body. This Force cannot exceed the houngan's Magic Attribute; as the Haitian saying goes, "Little horses
cannot carry great riders." The player or gamemaster then makes
a Conjuring Test against the chosen Force of the loa's manifestation. This process counts as a Complex Action. If the test is successful, the "mounting" occurs in the same round. If the houngan
does not have any actions left in this round, the mounting will
occur at the end of the round and before Initiative is determined
for the next round. The houngan cannot perform or maintain any
other magical effect while calling up a loa. One success is sufficient for the loa to enter the character's body.
If the Conjuring Test fails, the houngan cannot attempt to
summon that specific loa until after the next sunset.
THE MOUNTED HOUNGAN
While ridden by a loa, the houngan has limited control over
his or her own actions. During its manifestation, the loa is in control. A mount who wants to wrest conscious control of himself
away from the loa, or force the loa to take a specific action, must
make a Willpower Test against a base target number equal to the
loa's Force. The more powerful the loa's manifestation, the more
difficult the spirit is to control. For every 2 successes achieved in
the initial Conjuring Test, reduce the Willpower Test target number by 1.
The loa will depart when it has finished the task for which it
was called or whenever it wishes to, at the gamemaster's discretion. If the houngan wishes the spirit to leave before the loa is prepared to depart, he or she must make another Conjuring Test with
a base target number equal to the loa's Force. The loa may also be
exorcised from the houngan's body by another magician using
Banishing. Use the loa's Force as the target number and conduct
the banishing according to standard rules (p. 143, SRII). During
the banishing contest, neither the loa nor the mount may take any
action except those necessary to keep the contest going.
While inhabited by the loa, the houngan functions as a dualnatured being. Attacks from astral space inflict damage on the loa;
Deadly damage will disrupt the spirit and banish it but leave the
mount unharmed. Any physical damage inflicted, including physical spells grounding from astral space, harms the houngan's
body. If another character assenses a mounted houngan, he or she
sees the houngan's astral image engulfed in the stronger presence
of the loa.
DISMOUNTING
The houngan must use Willpower to resist (Force)D Stun
damage when the loa "dismounts" from his or her body. This
occurs regardless of how the loa leaves (banishment, the service
is done, time runs out). Houngans may use Centering to help
reduce this Drain.
After the loa has departed, the houngan may make a test to
determine if he or she remembers what occurred while the loa
was mounted. The houngan rolls a number of dice equal to his or
her Intelligence and Willpower combined against a target number
equal to the Force of the loa. Count the number of successes
achieved and consult the Mount Memory Table.
Agwe, loa of the sea, has just left the houngan
named Cajun Spice. Cajun discovers that his runner pals
are all lying unconscious around him. He has no idea
why, and so he attempts to remember what transpired
while he was mounted. Cajun has Intelligence 4 and
Willpower 5, so he rolls 9 dice against a target number
equal to the mounting loa's Force (4). Cajun achieves 4
successes. He has vague impressions of being ambushed
by somebody in uniform (he can't tell if it was the Star,
corp security, or even another team of runners). He also
has vivid, detailed memories of convincing the leader of on to the houngan.|
the ambush-a Lone Star officer-not to run his pals into
the station. Cajun Spice also remembers inviting the
leader of the Star unit to his home for dinner. Cajun still
has no idea why his friends are all unconscious or exactly where they are, but he has a dinner date with an
attractive Lone Star captain and Agwe will never forgive
him if he is not a gracious host.
MOUNT MEMORY TABLE
||Successes||Result||
|0-1|The houngan remembers nothing.|
|2-3|The houngan remembers vague, dreamlike images. The houngan has clear memories of all the specific incidents the loa regards as important, whether|
|4-5|the houngan considers them important or not.|
|6-7|As above, but the houngan remembers in a strangely detached way, as if he had been a third person watching his own actions.|
|8+|As above, plus the houngan remembers the loa's thoughts and feelings. This includes information
about relationships between the various loa, the loa's feelings about the people associating with the
houngan, and any "secret" information that the loa wants to pass|
FEEDING THE LOA
The relationship between a houngan and a loa is not a oneway street. As with standard shamanic traditions, the houngan
must openly worship or honor the loa, especially his or her mait
tete loa. The houngan must perform numerous yearly rituals of sacrifice to support the loa with whom he or she has bonded, ranging
from simple meals laid out upon a honfour's altar (see Honfours,
p. 66) to the complex and elaborate ceremonies such as those performed at the seaside to honor Agwe, in which a raft laden with
food and gifts is sunk into the sea to decorate the loa's table.
These banquets are very important to the loa, and a houngan
will usually invite other houngans to the biggest feasts. Keep in
mind that a houngan cannot afford to displease any of the loa with
whom he or she has bonded. If a player character is going to have
a great feast, it is expected that he or she will represent his or her
mait tete. If the character has bonded with other loa as well, those
loa must be present in the form of another houngan who has the
bonded loa as a mait tete. If a character fails to properly do the loa
honor in this way, the loa may refuse future summons (see
Roleplaying the Loa, p. 130).
In addition to meals, the houngan must feed the loa in another way. The houngan must sacrifice a part of his or her own being,
in the form of Karma, to the loa with whom he or she has a bond.
Each time a houngan calls up a loa, he or she must "feed" the
spirit by paying a point of Good Karma. Each point of Karma
allows the houngan to call the same loa as many times as the
houngan needs it, for up to 24 hours from the first "feeding."
Gamemasters may change this time limit depending on the relationship the houngan has maintained with the loa. For example,
if the houngan has not called upon the loa or shown it the
required honor, the loa may only answer the houngan's summons
for 12 hours per feeding. In extreme cases the loa may demand
payment in Karma each time it is called (see Roleplaying the Loa).
If the houngan does not have the Karma to pay on the spot,
the gamemaster may allow the loa to appear anyway. However,
the spirit will expect to be fed eventually and will become
enraged at any houngan who chooses to ignore such a debt. The
houngan generally suffers a loss of Magic Points or unwilling possession (see Unwilling Possession, p. 131).
CONTACTING NEW LOA
As houngan advance in initiation, they may contact and make
connections with loa other than their mait tete. To contact a loa,
the houngan must undertake an astral quest to Guinee, the Land
Beneath the Sea (see Guinee, p. 129). This astral quest a has a rating equal to the number of loa to whom the houngan is currently
bound. The final test in such an astral quest always occurs in the
Place of Charisma, where the houngan must convince his or her
chosen loa to accept the bond. This means that the player must
keep in mind the relationships between the loa (see About the
Loa, p. 120). The more loa the houngan is connected to, the more
difficult it becomes to make new bonds, given the infighting and
jealousy that sometimes exist between the loa.
If successful, the character expends a number of Karma Points
equal to the number of loa to whom he or she has bonds and creates a connection to the new loa. If the houngan fails in his or her
astral quest, the loa in question cannot be contacted again until
after a different loa has accepted the bond.
Gasser is on an astral quest to bond with
Damballah. Her mait tete is Erzulie, and so Damballah
would be her second loa. Poor Gasser fails in her quest,
so she cannot attempt to bond with Damballah until
another loa has accepted her. She tries again, this time
choosing Ayizan to be her second loa. The second astral
quest is successful, and so Gasser can now make another attempt to bond with Damballah (though this time it's
a bit tougher because she has bonded with two loa
instead of one).
A houngan may also willingly limit himself to bonding only
with his mait tete. For those houngans who prefer a relatively
uncomplicated life, this may be the best choice; a single bond
means the houngan never need worry about the current status of
the relationships between the loa. Someone so dedicated to a single loa will draw favorable notice from that loa and may even gain
greater benefits from his monogamous relationship. Each houngan must make his own choice in this matter, and no one style of
practicing voudoun is considered more correct than any other.
SERVITEURS
Serviteurs are mundane followers of the voudoun religion who
allow themselves to be mounted by a loa called by a houngan.
Because they lack the bond
with the loa that the magician
possesses, serviteurs must
make a Willpower Test against
a target number of twice the
manifestation's Force to conO
vince the loa to do something
against its wishes.
To be eligible for such
possession, a character must
undergo a ritual performed by
a houngan to initiate him or
her into the society of
voudoun, not unlike the rituals
magicians undergo to become
initiates. The gamemaster
determines the specific forms
of these rituals using the
ordeals found on pp. 39-41 of
Grimoire II, but they will
always reflect the mait tete of
the houngan. Because all serviteurs are mundanes, the rituals
will almost always involve
some type of asceticism, deed,
meditation or oath. The
gamemaster may also choose
to create new ordeals that he feels better reflect the voudoun tradition. Whatever its form, the ritual creates the magical link necessary
for the houngan to call up a loa to mount the serviteur. A player
character must pay a flat fee of 10 points of Good Karma to become
a serviteur, and must also pay a point of Good Karma when mounted by a loa (just as a houngan does).
A houngan player character can choose a serviteur to be one
of his or her followers at the time of character creation. The character may gain only one serviteur in this fashion; all others must
go through the process of initiation.
Becoming a serviteur is considered a serious commitment in
voudoun, and so player characters should not enter into it lightly.
A houngan should take care to make sure of the would-be serviteur's sincerity before conferring such status upon that character.
It is impossible to become a serviteur under false pretenses, for
one simple reason: even if the houngan can be fooled, the loa cannot. Player characters who abuse the loa's good will may well suffer their displeasure (see Unwilling Possession, p. 131).
HOUNGAN ABILITIES
Standard rules for shamanic magic apply to houngan player
characters, with the following exceptions and clarifications.
SORCERY
Houngans use the Sorcery Skill in the same manner as other
magicians. They cast spells in the same way that shamans do, and
many voudoun shamans choose Concentrations in ritual sorcery.
The optional rules for symbolic and sympathetic ritual links (p. 35,
Grimoire II) are recommended for voudoun rituals.
HONFOURS
A honfour functions in the
same manner and for the
same tasks as a standard
shaman's medicine lodge (p.
123, SRII). Honfours have the
same ratings and are built in
the same manner as medicine
lodges-materials for building one have the same costs.
METAMAGIC
A houngan initiate can use
all types of metamagic.
Traditionally, voudoun initiates only used centering and
dispelling, but in the
Awakened sprawls of 2057
they call upon all forms of
metamagic as needed.
Because of voudoun's long
history of ritual magic, centering has always been the most
prominent form of metamagic used by houngans. Initiates draw upon the rich heritage of
voudoun for their centering rituals: drumming, ecstatic dance,
chanting and the arcane Creole dialects of the islands all serve as
Centering skills for houngans. More esoteric centering rituals
include the drawing of vevers (mystic diagrams representing the
loa) and the making and use of fetishes like the often misunderstood voodoo doll (see Foci, p. 128).
CONJURING
Houngans cannot conjure nature spirits or elementals.
Instead, they use Conjuring Skill to call the loa with whom they
have formed a bond. A voudoun shaman may use conjuring to
banish nature spirits and elementals, but cannot attempt to take
control of either type of spirit.
All other uses of conjuring are available to houngans. They
may conjure watcher spirits, attempt to bind a free spirit if they
know its true name, and substitute their Conjuring Skill for an
Attribute when resisting an attack by a spirit (p. 143, SR II).
Houngans may also conjure work loa, as described below.
Conjuring Work Loa
Work loa are a unique type of watcher spirit (p. 73, Grimoire
II). Like standard watchers they are astral entities, unable to manifest in the physical world. Unlike standard watchers, they can
inhabit a living creature. A houngan may conjure and bind a number of work loa equal to his or her Charisma. Work loa must be in
the houngan's line of sight to receive new commands, but may
travel out of line of sight to fulfill those orders.
Unlike any other spirit, work loa require a "vessel" to contain
them. When they are not performing a service for their master, the
spirits reside in a govi, an enchanted clay jar (see Creating Govis,
below). Damage to the govi will also affect the spirits, and all the
spirits contained in it are disrupted if the govi is destroyed.
Fortunately for the houngan, the presence of work loa within a
govi provides the vessel with armor equal to the total Force of the
spirits present.
To conjure a work loa, a houngan requires a govi and a
honfour with a rating at least equal to the Force of the spirit. The
ritual takes a number of hours equal to the desired spirit's
Force. At the end of that time, the houngan makes a Conjuring
Test against a target number equal to the desired Force of the
work loa. Each success on the Conjuring Test equals one service
that the spirit will perform for the houngan. If the houngan
achieves no successes, no spirit appears, but the houngan must
still resist Drain.
WORK LOA CONJURING DRAIN TABLE
||Spirit's Force Rating||Drain||
|Less than half houngan's Charisma|(L) Stun|
|Houngan's Charisma or less|(M) Stun|
|Greater than houngan's Charisma|(S) Physical|
|Greater than twice houngan's Charisma|(D) Physical|

Due to the unique characteristics of work loa, the houngan must calculate the Drain Code for conjuring them in the
same manner as for elemental or nature spirits (p. 139, SRII),
not for watcher spirits. The houngan uses Charisma dice
rather than Willpower, adjusted as appropriate by foci or
other modifiers, against a target number equal to the Force of
the work loa. Consult the Conjuring Drain Table for the damage modifier, keeping in mind that every 2 successes generated in the Drain Resistance Test reduce the Drain by one
level. If the Drain knocks out the houngan, the work loa
remains as long as the govi has a Force Rating equal to or
greater than that of the work loa. If the work loa's Force is greater than that of the govi and the houngan falls unconscious from Drain, the work loa escapes from the govi and goes free (see Bought Loa, p. 124).
Work Loa
Anima voudoun laboris
Identification: Work loa are a class of spirits conjured by
practitioners of voudoun. They exist solely on the astral
plane and appear as bright, cloudy lights to astral senses.
The spirits often take on a semblance or outline of a
human form.
Magic Capability: Innate
Habitat: When called away from their home metaplane,
work loa inhabit enchanted vessels designed to contain
their essence.
Powers: Work loa have all of the abilities of watchers,
plus a unique form of the Inhabiting power (p. 67,
Grimoire II). The spirit may inhabit any normal critter
(paranormal animals and sentient beings are too magically powerful to be inhabited). While inhabiting a host,
the spirit functions as a dual-natured being and remains
astrally active. The critter's Attributes are increased by
the spirit's Force and the animal gains the powers of
Immunity to Age, Immunity to Pathogens and Immunity
to Normal Weapons. This type of possession counts as
one service and lasts for 24 hours. Each additional day of
possession counts as another service.
If the host body is destroyed, the work loa is disrupted. If a work loa gains its freedom while inhabiting a
host, it becomes permanently bound to that host body.
Creating Govis
To construct a govi, the houngan first makes a physical vessel and lid using material from the area near his or her honfour.
Traditionally, the houngan shaped clay or dirt, dried it in the honfour, etched it with images of the mait tete, and painted it before
attempting to enchant it. The urban houngan of 2057 uses many
other types of vessels, including bottles, cans, canisters, and other
miscellaneous trash (though for some reason, glass bottles seem
to work best). A govi cannot be bought, but it can be found.
Because most of them are not sculpted "from scratch," modern
govis require the addition of more personal touches than the traditional type to work, and so the houngan must draw or paint particularly elaborate designs on them and attach items of personal
importance. Modern govis often contain animal bones, especially
from dishes eaten by the houngan in any celebratory banquets
held for the houngan's mait tete.
After making the govi, the houngan enchants it using a variation of the Enchanting Test (p. 25, Grimoire II). The govi must be
created in the honfour and must have a Force Rating less than that
of the honfour or the Enchanting Skill of the houngan, whichever
is lower. Enchanting the govi takes a base time of 30 days and has
a base Target Number of 5. No modifiers apply to this test. If the
houngan achieves no successes after 30 days, he or she can stop
the enchantment and start over; however, all the materials used to
make the govi are wasted. The houngan must make a new govi,
and cannot make a second Enchanting Test until another 30 days
have passed. Once the houngan succeeds in enchanting the govi,
he or she spends 1 point of Karma per point of Force to "activate"
the govi. A govi can hold a number of work loa whose total Force
equals double the govi's Force Rating; for example, a govi with
Force Rating 4 can hold work loa with a total Force of up to 8.
The work loa "lives" in the govi until it is called upon to perform a service or services. If the work loa has multiple services to
perform, it will return to the govi after it completes each service.
The loa can enter or exit the govi as necessary, whether the lid is
on or off. If the houngan wishes to command a service from a spirit in the govi, the govi must be in the houngan's line of sight,
though the houngan can also astrally project to the govi and command the spirits from the astral plane. After performing all its services, the work loa returns to astral space.
In addition to serving as a holding container for work loa, a
govi can hold astral links to other astrally active beings and things.
Such a govi is created in the same way as one that holds a work
loa, except that the houngan must bond the govi to himself (see
p. 137, SRII) at a Karma Cost of 2 x the govi's Force Rating. The
houngan then links the govi to a particular target using the following process. Note that such astral links can only be made to
astrally active targets such as magicians, spirits or foci; mundane
characters or objects are not affected. A free spirit can only be
affected by such a link if the houngan knows the spirit's true
name.
To form an astral link between the govi and a target, the
houngan must astrally project to the target's location, carrying
along the astral form of the govi. The houngan must then make an
opposed test using Sorcery Skill against the target's Magic Rating
or Force; the target resists using Willpower against the houngan's
Sorcery Skill Rating. If the houngan is successful, he or she "steals"
a tiny amount of the target's energy and thereby creates an astral
link between the target and the govi. The govi may then be used
as a material link to the target for ritual sorcery (p. 127, SRII).
Modify the target number of Sendings against the target by -2 per
govi. A govi can only hold one astral link at a time, though a subject can be astrally linked to more than one govi. (In these cases,
the target has probably made someone very, very angry.)
When the link is being made, the target may fight back
through astral combat. The target must destroy the govi (and will
presumably also do as much damage as possible to the houngan
attempting to make the astral link). If the target wins the battle,
the link is broken and the target can no longer be magically linked
to that particular govi. If the target backs down and the govi
remains intact, reduce the target number for all Sendings against
the target by 4 per govi. After a govi is linked to a target, anyone
may attempt astral combat against it (and against anything that
protects it, including the honfours, wards and even the houngan)
to take back the stolen energy. Any number of attacks can be
made against a single govi from astral space.
The govi can also be destroyed physically. Every govi, no
matter what material it is made of, has a Barrier Rating equal to its
Force; to destroy it, the attacking character must reduce this
Barrier Rating to 0. Spells cannot be linked or anchored to the govi
to protect it, but it can be placed inside items that carry such magical safeguards. Once a govi is physically destroyed, any astral link
it carried is broken.
If any attack-whether physical or astral-destroys the govi,
both the creator of the govi and the target astrally linked to it suffer astral backlash. The govi's creator suffers Moderate Stun damage; the subject of the link suffers Serious Stun damage. Both the
subject and the houngan may make a Willpower Test to reduce
this damage against a target number equal to the govi's force; for
every 2 successes achieved, reduce the damage by 1 level.
A houngan player character may begin play with a govi. This
beginning govi has a Force of 1 and costs 3,000 nuyen from the
player character's starting Resources. This cost reflects the time
and effort the houngan put into making the govi rather than pursing other things. (Govis are never sold; voudoun practitioners
consider it insulting to compel any spirit to live in a "purchased"
govi, and no houngan would do such a thing.)
FOCI
Houngans can create and use all the types of foci listed in the
Shadowrun rulebook and Grimoire II. Standard spirit foci have no
effect against the major loa; the loa are more powerful than mere
spirits and cannot be commanded by such items. However, houngans may use other types of spirit foci to aid in banishing the loa.
FETISHES
Voudoun makes heavy use of fetishes for sorcery.
Traditionally, houngans made their own, though talismongers in
major urban areas almost always carry voudoun material (usually
just for show and mood). Common fetishes include straw dolls,
feathers, dried and preserved animal parts such as snake skins,
rattles, drums, ceremonial jewelry and small bags of dried herbs.
The famous voodoo doll is a simple fetish, though many astrally
linked govi include one (it adds to the mystery).
LOA FOCI
A houngan may construct a unique enchantment known as a
loa focus (p. 27, Grimoire II) to aid in calling up a particular loa.
The formula for this focus requires the houngan to undertake an
astral quest to Guinee with a rating equal to the desired rating of
the focus. The houngan then asks the loa for special permission to
create the focus and seeks advice in its construction. The houngan
must already have established a bond with the loa to make the
focus, and the astral quest required to design the focus must be
made in addition to any quests the houngan makes in order to
bond with new loa.
A loa focus provides additional Conjuring dice equal to its
rating when the houngan calls up the loa for which it is designed.
Use standard spirit focus values for Enchanting Tests and Bonding
Costs.
SPIRIT FOCI
Houngans can create spirit foci to enhance their ability to conjure and command work loa. These follow the normal rules for spirit foci. A houngan can also construct a unique enchantment focus
for conjuring a loa achete if he or she knows the spirit's true name.
GUINEE
Guinee, also called the Land Beneath the Sea, is the home of
the loa. Every follower of voudoun, whether magically active or
mundane, considers Guinee a holy place that defies description
and full understanding. Houngan initiates can undertake astral
quests to Guinee to make contact with other loa and form bonds
with them. Some free spirits also appear to call Guinee their home
metaplane, and houngans interested in contacting them make
astral quests to Guinee in the same manner as other shamans
make to the native planes of other free spirits.
Guinee exists as a part of the Metaplane of Man. How a
houngan gets there and what he or she does there is up to the
imaginations of the gamemaster and the player, within the following guidelines. The Dweller on the Threshold usually appears
as the Petro version of the houngan's mait tete (what a Petro
houngan encounters is too hideous to comprehend). If the player
character's mait tete does not have a Petro version, the gamemaster can choose any Petro loa for the Dweller. The player character
must "visit" all the loa to whom he or she has bonded, paying
special attention to the mait tete loa. A houngan who does not
show respect for all bonded loa fails the astral quest and faces
punishment by the loa that he or she displeased (see Unwilling
Possession, p. 131).
If the questing character wishes, he or she may feed Karma to
a bonded loa while visiting it, before going to the Place of Charisma.
This action nets the questing character 1 die per point of Karma
spent to add to the Social Skill Test he or she must make to resist
damage. The character may spend only 1 point of Karma per loa
except for the mait tete loa, who will accept up to the quest's rating in Karma. If the gamemaster prefers to roleplay the astral quest
rather than rely on dice, Karma fed to the loa represents hints, clues
and things to look for when being tested by the new loa.
One of the many oddities about Guinee that plague magical
theorists is that, while other metaplanes look different in each
astral quest, Guinee seems to look approximately the same.
Whether it remains unchanging because the loa have imprinted it
or because everyone who goes there expects it to look the same
is the subject of endless debate. Whatever the case, Guinee
should look the same each time the questing character goes
there. However, the Place of Charisma and the Citadel are left to
the gamemaster to design.
PETRO RITES
Petro voudoun is a tradition of dark and violent emotion. For
example, in Rada voudoun Legba is the Sun; his Petro counterpart, Carrefour, is Lord of the Night and master of the demons of
ill chance, misfortune and destruction. As a Petro loa, Ghede
becomes Baron Samedi, Lord of Death, cemeteries and zombies,
and patron of black magic, who can turn men into ravening
beasts. In the past, Petro was not regarded as evil; practitioners
considered it a complement to the Rada rite, seeing neither as

entirely complete without the other. In the Awakened world,
however, Petro has become darker and more negative, twisting
and perverting the light of the Rada rite. As with any religion or
magical tradition, there are those who use their powers for selfish
and evil reasons; these people tend to become Petro houngans.
Followers of Petro call upon the loa for power that is all-consuming and dangerous. Petro houngans are also the only ones who
can create zombies. A player character cannot play a Petro houngan; practitioners of these rites may only be non-player characters.
ZOMBIES
Petro houngans can create three types of zombies: biochemical zombies (also known as "living dead"), corps cadavres
(described on p. 30, Paranormal Animals of Europe) and loa
zombies (sometimes known as "astral zombies"). The techniques
for creating each type are briefly described below.
Biochemical zombies are created through "zombie powder,"
a combination of natural neurotoxins. The houngan must gather
the necessary raw materials by hand; thus far, they are native only
to the nations of the Caribbean League, though rumors of Petro
houngans growing the plants in urban areas are increasing.
Another rumor has it that some urban Petro houngans have been
experimenting-so far with no known success-with various
chemicals and materials from talismongers and similar sources.
In order to work, the powder must be ingested or touch the
victim's exposed skin. The victim must make a Body Test against
a target number equal to the Enchanting Skill of the powder's
creator. If the test fails, the victim sickens and falls into a deathlike coma over the course of seven days. If the test is successful,
the victim becomes ill but recovers within in 24 to 48 hours.
Once the "dead" victim has been buried, the houngan
retrieves the comatose body and applies the second part of the
formula, which reduces the victim's Willpower to 1. The houngan
then uses a spell quickened or secured with a spell lock-generally a Control Actions spell-to control the victim.
A Petro houngan can also magically create zombies from the
dead bodies of humans and metahumans. Through a combination
of Sorcery and Enchanting, the houngan can create a corps
cadavre. This process requires the houngan to use the Enchanting
Skill, with a Base Time of 10 days and a Target Number of 4, to
properly prepare the corpse. He or she then casts the corps
cadavre spell, a manipulation spell (described below) to animate
the creature. Once the corps cadavre has been animated, it will
obey the commands of its creator until it rots away (within a
month or two). Corps cadavres accept spoken commands from
their creator. For additional details and game statistics, see p. 30,
Paranormal Animals of Europe.
Corps Cadavre
When cast on a specially prepared corpse, this spell animates it as a corps cadavre. The caster of the spell can issue
simple commands to the creature to carry out basic tasks.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent (20)
Drain: [(F/2) + 2]S
Target: 6
To make a loa zombie, a houngan can command a bound
work loa to use its inhabitation power to animate a human or
metahuman corpse. The host body uses its original physical statistics plus the Force of the spirit; its mental statistics are equal to
the work loa's Force. This type of zombie also gains Immunity to
Age, Immunity to Toxins and Pathogens, and Immunity to Normal
Weapons. Each 24 hours that the loa inhabits the body counts as
one service. The work loa can be fought in astral combat while
inhabiting a body and can also be banished normally.
Generally speaking, cybernetic or magical enhancements that
a corpse possessed while living do not function for it as a zombie
because they require a functional biosystem and/or living spirit to
work. Locked or anchored spells are the only exception to this
rule; these may continue to function at the gamemaster's discretion if they are physical spells. However, the zombie's condition
may alter or reduce their effects.
BOCORS
In the voudoun tradition, a bocor is a magician who practices
magic without a loa as guide and patron. In Shadowrun game
terms, a bocor may simply be a hermetic mage, shaman or adept
who is not a practitioner of voudoun. A bocor may also be the
voudoun equivalent of a burned-out mage, a houngan who
crossed the loa one too many times and has therefore lost contact
with his or her mait tete. These burnouts are lost and lonely, often
desperate to re-connect with the loa they abandoned; because of
this, they may be prepared to do just about anything if they
believe it will help their cause. Their desperation may make them
threatening or sympathetic, depending on the needs of the story
in which they appear. If such a houngan is used as a non-player
character, the gamemaster may boost the character's Magical
Threat Rating if he or she so desires.
A non-player character bocor can also be something considerably more dangerous: a toxic follower of a twisted form of
voudoun, bent on destruction and death in order to gratify what
he or she perceives as the desires of violent and angry loa. Such
individuals are ruthless and frightening. At the gamemaster's discretion, this type of bocor might have a greatly enhanced Magical
Threat Rating.
VOUDOUN PLAYER CHARACTERS
For characters who follow voudoun instead of the usual hermetic or shaman traditions, character creation works just as it does
with hermetics and standard shamans. Human characters must
allocate Magic as Priority A, and metahuman characters must allocate it as Priority B. Though a character of any race can be a follower of voudoun, the majority of houngans in the Shadowrun
universe are humans and orks. All voudoun player characters
practice the Rada rite. Petro rites are off-limits to player characters,
and Petro houngans should only be used as the opposition.
Voudoun seems to thrive wherever people are oppressed and
denied their rights. The tradition is slowly becoming more prevalent in the metroplexes of Shadowrun, though some consider it
just a blip on the Awakened world's radar screen. The strength of
voudoun comes from the fact that its followers believe in it as both
a magical system and a mundane religion, much like Native
American totem worship. Despite the efforts of some to prove that
voudoun is everything from a toxic version of shamanism to a fluke
in the magical continuum, the tradition continues to grow. The
player playing a voudoun character must understand that voudoun
is a religion as well as a magical tradition. Voudoun has many mundane believers, and so a houngan may be a spiritual leader with
mundane followers as well as an individual magician.
The houngan player character has a different approach to
magic than other magicians; he or she sees it as a force to be used
only with the guidance of the loa. Those who do not heed a loa's
wisdom when using magic are considered bocors, and followers
of voudoun tend not to trust them. Though this attitude is gradually changing with the hermetic understanding of magic, prejudice remains strong among the poorer and less educated.
ROLEPLAYING THE LOA
The greatest challenge in playing a houngan is roleplaying
the mounting of a loa. Rather than reduce the houngan to a nonplayer character for the duration of the loa's stay, players may use
the following guidelines when roleplaying this experience.
A houngan being "ridden" by a loa should not behave as he or
she normally would; the character's behavior should be totally
unrecognizable even to friends. For a general idea of how a given loa
might act, see About the Loa, p. 120, and also Major Loa, p. 60).
What the houngan does under the loa's influence during each specific mounting is up to the player and gamemaster, with the
gamemaster being the final arbiter. Keep in mind that the loa always
has its own agenda, which comes out in the houngan's actions.
Stoner, a street samurai, has fallen victim to some
kind of poisoning. Stoner's buddy Big Jam calls upon his
mait tete, Ghede, to mount him so that the loa's presence can enhance his Biotech Skill and let him keep his
pal alive until they can get him to a street doc. Big Jam
succeeds at all the necessary tests and Ghede takes over
Big Jam's body. Ghede likes a party, and wants to go find
the nearest food, drink and fun; he doesn't particularly
want to be bothered saving Stoner. Big Jam must struggle with the loa to make it do what he wants; he must
overcome the Force of Ghede's mounting with his own
Willpower. Big Jam wins the struggle he promises
Ghede that they will find the nearest nightclub and have
a rip-roaring good time with unlimited food and drinks if
Ghede lets him help his friend first. Ghede agrees to the
bargain.
Much later, Ghede dismounts from Big Jam just as
the nightclub owner screams closing time. Big Jam must
now try to remember what he did in the past five hours,
and hope he has enough cred to pay the tab.
Even though the loa is in control of the houngan's body, the
houngan remains aware of what is happening. The player character is still present in his body, watching himself act and speak
under the loa's influence. This awareness makes it possible for the
houngan to influence the loa; however, to compel a powerful loa
to do something against its inclination is not an easy task. It is
made harder by the feeling of detachment that comes over a
mounted houngan; he sees himself as if he was watching a third
party, and so must overcome his own feeling of inertia as well as
the loa's will in order to compel it to act.
Being mounted by a loa has certain physical consequences
for the character as well. The sheer power surge of the loa's
entrance produces a corresponding exhaustion when the loa
leaves, and a houngan from whom a loa has just dismounted will
feel intense fatigue and at least momentary disorientation. He or
she also often feels an overwhelming need to eat, drink or sleep
(or all three, depending on the choice of the player and gamemaster). If the houngan does not cope particularly well with this kind
of shock to his system or if he is tired to begin with, he may be
unable to remember clearly what happened while the loa possessed him. The detached quality of the houngan's memories add
to his or her disorientation.
With every mounting, the gamemaster determines if the
houngan player character has paid proper respect to the loa.
Many players may find it easier to roleplay a houngan who is
bound only to his or her mait tete; such a character need not
worry about paying respect to multiple loa or inadvertently
offending one by honoring another with whom the first has a
quarrel. Also, devotion to a single loa usually means that the loa
will grant special favors or even adjust payments and length of
service (see Feeding the Loa, p. 125).
Wisdom of the Loa
The loa are powerful spirits capable of imparting a great deal
of knowledge. A houngan will often call up a loa so that it can
answer questions the houngan may have. Most of the time other
people ask the loa the questions, then report its answers to the
houngan after the spirit has departed.
No game system is presented for imparting information
through the loa. How much a given loa can or will tell the player
characters in any situation is up to the gamemaster. As a general
rule, the loa do not tell all they know about a subject; also the
information they give is frequently incomplete or biased. The loa
may also put a price on its knowledge, to be paid either in Karma
or by performing a special service for the loa. Finally, loa are not
omniscient, and may simply not know much about matters outside their sphere of influence. For example, Azaca will not know
the latest twists of corporate politics, nor will Erzulie know about
stock trends. The gamemaster is advised to use the wisdom of the
loa sparingly as a means to keep adventures and story lines moving in the right direction. Remember also that a loa can appear in
order to aid a follower without being called if the loa sees fit.
UNWILLING POSSESSION
The gamemaster can use unwilling possession as an adventure hook, as a means of warning a character who is acting in a
way likely to offend the loa, or as an object lesson for a character
who has been especially disrespectful. Gamemasters should
reserve this sort of manifestation for a character who has committed serious offenses against the loa.
Houngans and serviteurs cannot resist an unwilling possession. Other characters possessed by a loa for whatever reason
should treat the possession as a use of the possession power
common to free spirits (p. 80, Grimoire II) at a Force chosen by
the gamemaster. Unlike a mounting, unwilling possession strips
the character of all control over his actions; despite being able to
watch everything that is going on, he cannot influence the loa in
the slightest. A loa who possesses a houngan or serviteur in this
manner is doing it to show him or her who's boss, and so devotes
all of its considerable power to controlling the character's every
move and word. As its parting act of punishment, the loa ensures
that the possessed character will remember absolutely everything
in excruciating detail after the loa departs-especially the terrifying sense of utter helplessness that the character felt. If a possessed character has been especially disrespectful, the loa will
intensify that fear, leaving the character a small, gibbering heap on
the ground for several minutes. At the gamemaster's discretion, a
character may relive the possession in horrible nightmares for
weeks after the experience.
In the most severe cases, a loa can inflict a mortal wound on
a houngan, thus reducing his or her Magic Rating. If a loa takes
such an action, the character loses his or her bond with that loa
and may never get it back. If the houngan's mait tete causes a
mortal wound, the player character loses all contact with all the
loa and becomes a bocor (see Bocors, p. 130).

STREET GRIMOIRE
The Street Grimoire presents new, street-tested spells and elemental effects. As always,
gamemasters may prohibit the use of any spell, or modify these spells before allowing them
to be used in their games. The gamemaster and players should agree on the new spells they
will add to their campaign before introducing them into play.
ELEMENTAL EFFECTS
Use the following elemental effects in the same way as those published in the Grimoire,
Second Edition. As with the effects listed in Grimoire II, these elemental effects occur only
with physical spells.
Each effect creates primary and secondary damage. Primary damage is determined by the
Damage Code of the spell cast that caused the elemental effects. Primary effects may react with
armor and other defenses as well as representing the more traditional side effects of the spell.
The gamemaster determines the power and prevalence of secondary effects. Secondary
effects always affect the area around the spell. For example, the secondary effects of a lightbased spell may burn out optical scanners and cameras in the spell's immediate vicinity.
Because spell names do not always accurately reflect the nature of the spell (physical,
manipulation, and so on), players and gamemasters should read the spell description carefully to determine if casting the spell might create elemental effects.
LIGHT
Primary Damage: Subject suffers a Glare effect penalty (see Visibility Table, p. 89, SRII) for 1
Combat Turn after the attack, unless the character has the flare compensation adept power or
cybernetic flare compensation. If the gamemaster determines that creatures with an allergy or
vulnerability to sunlight may take additional damage from this effect, increase the damage of
the spell 1 level.
Secondary Effects: The secondary effects of a light-based spell rarely ignite flammable materials, but may if the effect passes through glass or any magnifying substance. This effect will overload optical scanners and surveillance cameras without
shielded, polarized or colored lenses.
SAND
Primary Damage: The sand effect produces a high-velocity jet or
cloud of sand that shoots toward the subject in the style of a
mechanical sandblaster. The effect does tearing, abrasive damage
and is resisted by Impact armor (one-half damage, round down).
The smothering effect of sand attacks inflicts an extra Wound level
against manifested air elementals.
Secondary Effects: Sand gets into everything. It can get under
clothing (itching and possible skin burn), into machinery (guns
jam, motors stop working) and will slow movement (double all
movement modifiers). This secondary effect does not affect airtight clothing that is not ripped by the primary damage of the
sand effect, and munitions and machinery that are fully sealed
against the environment. Affected machinery and guns remain
jammed until cleaned.
SMOKE
Primary Damage: The smoke effect creates a thick cloud of heavy
smoke that suffocates the subject. The smoke effect inflicts Stun
damage; a sustained effect can cause that damage to eventually
overflow on to the subject's Physical Condition Monitor. If the
spell creating the smoke effect was cast in an area occupied by a
manifested air elemental, the effect causes no damage.
The smoke effect reduces visibility for everyone in the area.
The targeted character adds 4 to all Visibility Tests. All others in
the area receive a +2 visibility modifier. Smoke lasts 1 round
longer than the spell that created it.
Secondary Effects: The smoke effect can cause characters without
access to uncontaminated air to gag and have trouble breathing.
All those within the area of the smoke effect take Light Stun damage each turn the smoke persists. Because smoke also dampens
sound, add 2 to the target number for all Perception Tests made
within the smoke effect involving sounds and sound location.
COMBAT SPELLS
REDIRECT
The redirect spell sends the energy of an incoming physical
or melee attack back against the attacker in the form of a powerful mental shock.
To use the spell, the target magician must have a higher
Initiative than the attacker and must delay his action. The target
magician makes a Spell (4) Test. If his successes exceed the attacker's Attack Test successes, the target magician avoids the attack
and sends it back to the attacker, who suffers Stun damage with a
Damage Code equal to the initial attack. The target magician must
resist Drain equal to half the Force of the spell at a Damage Level
one less than the Damage Level of the initial attack. If the attacker and the target magician achieve the same number of successes, the redirect spell has no effect and the target magician takes
damage from the initial attack.
The attacker may resist the Stun damage with Willpower.
Armor has no effect.
Redirect spells may be anchored to places or objects (see p.
47, Grimoire II).
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Damage Level: Same as original attack
Duration: Instant
Drain: Special

ROT
The rot spell causes inanimate organic matter such as leather,
wood, meat, paper and the like to decay rapidly and disintegrate.
To cast the rot spell, the magician makes a Spell Test against an
appropriate target number from the Object Resistance Table, p.
130, SRII.
Note that the rot spell is effective against loa zombies, which
are actually animated corpses. Against such zombies, the spell
causes a base Damage Level of Serious. The target number is the
zombie's Body Rating modified by any armor or magic.
Because ghouls, vampires, banshees and other such undead
are altered living creatures rather than dead beings, the rot spell
does not affect them. This spell does not affect zombies created
by zombie dust, or corps cadavres (see Zombies, p. 129).
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: Object Resistance Table
Damage Level: S
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
Duration: Instant
SHATTERSHIELD
The shattershield spell is specifically designed to break
through magical barriers such as wards. The spell strikes the barrier with a single attack. If the attack is successful, reduce the
Barrier or Ward Rating by 1, and for every 2 successes beyond the
first, reduce the Barrier or Ward Rating by an additional 1 point.
For example, 3 successes reduce the Ward Rating by 2, 5 successes reduce it by 3, and so on. Throretically, a character can
shatter a ward with a single spell.
To use the shattershield spell against astral barriers (such as
wards or mana barriers), the spellcaster must be astrally active and
able to assense the barrier when the spell is cast.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Force (R)
Damage Level: D
Drain: (F : 2)S
Duration: Instant
DETECTION SPELLS
ANIMAL SPY
The animal spy spell enables a magician to perceive his surroundings using the senses of any non-paranormal animal. The
animal must be within a range of meters in a circle around the
caster determined by the following formula: Spell Test Successes
x Magic Attribute × 5.
The spellcaster has no control over the animal's actions and
cannot target spells using the animal's eyesight. As long as the
magician sustains the spell, he can switch to the senses of any
other animal within the spell's range by spending a Simple Action.
If the gamemaster believes that a targeted animal would
have some reason to resist this spell (most animals would be
completely unaware of it), he may make a Willpower Test against
the Force of the spell. If the test succeeds, the spell does not affect
the animal.
Type: Mana
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Range: Limited
Drain: (F + 2)L
ASTRAL SENSE
The astral sense spell enables the spellcaster to sense the
presence of astrally active forms within the spell's range (spellcaster's Magic Attribute × 5 meters), even if the character is not
astrally active at the time. To use the spell, the magician makes a
Spell Success (10) Test. All standard modifiers apply to this test.
Each success on the Spell Success Test allows the character to
sense astrally active forms of a Force or Magic rating equal to the
number of successes. For example, 3 successes allow a character
to sense all the items of Force or Magic Rating 3 or below within
range, but not a Rating 5 ward.
This spell cannot differentiate between spirits, spells and
other astrally active forms such as foci and wards.
Type: Mana
Range: Limited
Target: 10
Duration: Sustained
Drain: (F + 2)M
CATALOGUE
The catalogue spell is a simple area-effect spell that enables
the spellcaster to compile a comprehensive, itemized list of all of
the non living items within his line of sight. If the Spell Test succeeds, the caster becomes able to write or dictate a list of all the
items in a manner similar to automatic writing. (If the spell's area
of effect contains items that the magician would not recognize on
sight, they will be listed as "unknown.") The spell cannot catalogue what the spellcaster cannot see. A warehouse full of boxes,
for example, will list the number of boxes rather than what the
boxes contain. As soon as he produces the list, the caster forgets
the exact items and quantities.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) - 1]L
DIAGNOSE
The diagnose spell provides the spellcaster with information
on any illnesses, injuries or other medical problems from which
the subject suffers. To use the spell, the magician makes a Spell
Success Test against a target number equal to 10 minus the subject's Essence Rating. For 1 success, the spell reveals whether the
subject is healthy or ill and provides a general idea of the subject's
Essence (high, average, dangerously low, hey-you're dead!). For
3 successes, the spell reveals specific illnesses or injuries, and for
5 successes it reveals even difficult-to-detect viruses (such as
HMHVV) and internal injuries.
This spell does not differentiate between low Essence due to
deadly wounds or as a result of cyberware. The magician can only
tell that something serious happened to the target's body.
Type: Mana
Range: Limited
Target: 10 - Target's Essence Rating
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) - 1]M
ENHANCE AIM
The enhance aim spell allows the spellcaster to reduce a fellow character's ranged attack target modifiers by 2. The effect is
not cumulative with modifiers from smartgun links, smartgoggles or laser sights, but does enhance non-electronic rangefinders and
scopes. A magician may cast this spell on himself, but the penalty for sustaining the spell will cancel out the targeting modifier
unless the magician uses some other means, such as a spell lock or spirit, to sustain the spell.
Type: Mana
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Range: Limited
Drain: (F + 2)S
FORETELLING
The foretelling spell gives the spellcaster a brief insight into
the probabilities surrounding a future event. If the Spell Success
Test is successful, the magician receives either a brief vision of the
circumstances surrounding a specific event or the answer to a single yes-or-no question concerning some future event.
Precognition is a very speculative area of magical study, and
so the effects of a foretelling spell are not entirely predictable. Use
it as a means of providing information, hints and foreshadowings
to the players, but do not provide them with definitive answers
about the future.
Many magicians make use of fetishes such as crystals, mirrors, cards, yarrow sticks, bones and rune stones when casting
this spell.
*The gamemaster must handle this powerful, dangerous spell
with great care to avoid upsetting the balance of his game. Do not
allow the foretelling spell to ruin planned events-as always, the
truth and degree of information provided is at the gamemaster's
discretion.
Type: Mana
Target: 10
Range: Self
Duration: Instant
Drain: (F + 2)D
NIGHT VISION
The night vision spell grants the target the low-light vision
modifiers listed on the Visibility Table, p. 89, SRII.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: (F + 2)L
TRANSLATE
The translate spell sets up a low-level telepathic connection
between two willing subjects. The connection allows the subjects
to converse with one another as if both spoke the same language.
Generally, the spell translates a speaker's intent more accurately
than his exact phrasing, so it is no replacement for the tact of a
skilled translator. Nevertheless, international corporate and government types often use translate spells to conduct transactions
and negotiations. The number of successes the spellcaster
achieves on his Spell Success Test indicate the quality of the translation.
Type: Mana
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Range: Limited
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]L
X-RAY VISION
The x-ray vision spell enables a willing subject to see through
inanimate barriers. For each success on the spellcaster's Spell
Success Test, the subject can see through 1 Barrier Rating Point of
non-living objects. The subject must spend a Simple Action to do
so. The line of sight provided by the x-ray vision spell fulfills the
LOS requirement for casting other spells.
The x-ray vision spell does not enable subjects to see through
living or magical barriers, and does not work in astral space.
Type: Physical
Range: Limited
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
HEALTH SPELLS
ALLEVIATE ALLERGY
The alleviate allergy spell allows the spellcaster to reduce the
effects of an allergy suffered by the spell's target. For example, an
alleviate severe allergy spell would protect a vampire exposed to
sunlight. Because it does not aid against vulnerabilities, however,
the alleviate allergy spell would not protect the vampire from an
attack with a wooden weapon.
Type: Physical
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: Nuisance: (F + 2)L
Mild: (F + 2)M
Moderate: (F + 2)S
Severe: (F + 2)D
AWAKEN
As soon as the awaken spell is cast, the target of the spell
wakes up and is immediately aware of his or her surroundings.
Spellcasters can also use the awaken spell to revive unconscious
subjects, though such targets will remain conscious for only one
minute per success before lapsing back into unconsciousness.
Type: Mana
Range: Touch
Target: 10 - Subject's Essence Rating
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) - 1]L
BLINDNESS
The blindness spell magically renders a subject blind for the
duration of the spell. The spell affects the brain's ability to receive
visual information, and so it affects subjects with cybereyes as
well.
Type: Mana
Target: Body (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F : 2) + 1]D
Range: LOS
CAUSE ALLERGY
The cause allergy spell inflicts on the subject an allergic reaction of the spellcaster's choice (subject to gamemaster approval).
The allergy must be triggered by a specific material. See the
Allergy and Severity Table, p. 46, SRII, and the critter allergy
description on p. 220, SRII, for guidelines.
Subjects of the spell are afflicted with the standard effects of
the allergy. Severe allergies to some substances (such as sunlight
or iron) may be fatal if sustained long enough.
The alleviate allergy spell cancels the effects of this spell.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: 10 - Subject's Essence
Duration: Sustained
Drain: Nuisance: [(F/2) +1]L
Mild: [(F + 2) + 1]M
Moderate: [(F + 2) + 1]S
Severe: [(F + 2) + 1]D
CRIPPLE LIMB
The cripple limb spell enables a caster to incapacitate any
organic limb by touching it. The affected limb becomes useless for
the duration of the spell.
Type: Mana
Range: Touch
Target: Body (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: (F + 2)S
FAST
The fast spell enables a voluntary subject to ignore feelings of
hunger or thirst for 48 hours, beginning when the spell is cast. The
spell does not alleviate the subject's need for nourishment or
hydration-only his desire for them. Wealthy individuals often use
the fast spell as a "diet spell."
Type: Mana
Range: Touch
Target: Body
Duration: Permanent (10 turns)
Drain: (F + 2)L
INTOXICATION
The intoxication spell causes a subject to feel the effects of
inebriation. The subject suffers penalties to all actions as if a number of boxes equal to the spellcaster's successes were filled in on
the subject's Stun Condition Monitor (see the Damage Modifiers
table, p. 112, SRII). The penalties do not reflect actual damageonly the spell's effects. If the casting magician scores 10 or more
successes on his Spell Success Test, the subject remains conscious
but becomes incapable of action.
Magician targets may use the antidote or detox spells to
resist the effects of intoxication. Blood filters do not resist the
effects because the inebriation is not physical; there are no toxins
actually in the target's blood.
Type: Mana
Target: Body (R)
Range: LOS
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]M
NUTRITION
The nutrition spell provides a voluntary target with a full day's
nourishment and hydration-essentially, a shot of pure mana. The
nutrition spell does not satisfy feelings of hunger or thirst.
Type: Mana
Range: Touch
Target: 4
Duration: Permanent (15 turns)
Drain: (F + 2)L
PARALYZE
The paralyze spell overrides and paralyzes all of a subject's
voluntary muscles (yes, the target can still breathe), rendering the
subject unable to move or speak while the spell is sustained. To
resist the spell's effects, the subject can make a Willpower Test
each round against a target number equal to the spell's Force. If
any of the subject's Willpower Tests yields more successes than
the caster's Spell Test successes, the paralyze spell is broken.
Cyberware may continue to work as long as it can function
independently of the body's functions, such as a datajack, dermal
plating, or tactical computer.
Type: Mana
Range: Limited
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]D
ILLUSION SPELLS
AGONIZING PAIN
The agonizing pain spell inflicts crippling pain on a target. If
the spell is successful, the target suffers temporary Stun Damage
of 1 box on the character's Condition Monitor for each success.
The Stun Damage target modifers apply to all tests the target
makes.
If the spellcaster achieves 10 or more successes, the pain
incapacitates the subject, leaving him unable to move or act. Note
that the target need not "recover" from the agonizing pain spell;
he suffers no real damage.
If the target makes a successful Willpower Test against a target number equal to the spellcaster's total number of successes,
he may ignore the spell's effects and perform 1 action.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
CHAFF
The chaff spell, a variation of the chaotic world spell (p. 155,
SRII), adds 1 to the target numbers for use of all non-living sensing devices, including weapon targeting systems such as the
smartgun link.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: Object Resistance Table
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) - 1]S
CROWD SCENE
The crowd scene spell creates an area-effect illusion of a fairly homogenous scene of people milling about. The "crowd"
appears to be a fairly typical one for the area where it appears,
provided the spellcaster is at least passing familiar with the place.
The image is not solid and makes no sound, and anyone physically
interacting with the crowd immediately knows that it is an illusion.
Otherwise, a character can make a Resistance Test against a target
number equal to the spellcaster's successes multiplied by 2, to
determine that the scene is an illusion.
The crowd scene spell can be used to provide cover or distraction. The entertainment industry sometimes uses the spell for
special effects and to replace extras; because the spell is physical,
cameras and other sensing devices register the image.
Type: Physical
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]M
DISREGARD
The disregard spell places a voluntary subject "outside" the
perceptions of other individuals. The subject remains visible and
detectable by mechanical means, but individuals simply disregard
or fail to notice the subject. A character may defeat the spell by
making a successful Intelligence Test against a target number
equal to twice the number of successes the spellcaster achieved
on his Spell Success Test.
Type: Mana
Range: Touch
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Drain: (F + 2)M
DREAM
The dream spell enables a magician to transmit a dream
image to a sleeping subject. Dream images cannot cause actual
harm but may entertain, relax or frighten the subject. Subjects
who experience nightmares do not recover from Mental or Stun
damage while the nightmares persist, nor do they receive any rest
during such periods. Subjects vividly remember dream images
when awakened.
A subject may discern that a dream image results from magical means by making a successful Intelligence Test against a target number equal to twice the number of successes achieved by
the spellcaster.
The dream spell is often cast via ritual sorcery as a means of
sending warnings, threats or torment to an enemy. Modern psychologists and dream therapists may use it as well.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: (F + 2)L
FLARE
The flare spell creates a bright flash of light that temporarily
blinds a target. To use the spell, a magician must make a Spell
Success Test against a target number equal to the target's
Quickness. At the same time, the targeted character makes an
opposed Quickness Test against a target number equal to the
spell's Power. If the target possesses either the adept power of
flare compensation or the cyberware version, reduce the target
number by 4 (to a minimum of 2).
Each net success scored by the spellcaster blinds the target
for 1 Combat Turn.
The flare spell creates a physical illusion, so cameras and
cybereyes (even those with flare compensation) can be affected
by the spell.
Type: Physical
Target: Quickness (R)
Duration: Instant
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
SILENCE
The silence spell is an area effect spell that creates a sounddeadening field. All sounds created within the area are deadened,
and no sounds can pass into or through the area.
The silence spell is a physical spell, and so mechanical or
electrical recording devices cannot detect sounds deadened by
the spell. Verbal communication cannot be heard, and sonic
attacks and critter powers that rely on sound (such as paralyzing
howl) fail within the area affected by the spell. If the casting magician's position falls within the area affected by the spell, he suffers
the effects of the silence spell.
The personal version of the silence spell has a Drain of [(F +
2) + 2]M and affects only a single subject.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
CONTROL MANIPULATIONS
CALM ANIMAL
The calm animal spell causes a subject of animal-level intelligence to become calm and passive. Subjects engaged in combat
reduce their target number to resist the spell by 2.
A target under the effects of the calm animal spell will attack
only to protect itself. A magician casting the area-effect version of
the calm animal spell must resist Drain of [(F + 2) + 2]M. This version of the spell has a limited range.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]L
COMPEL TRUTH
The compel truth spell forces a target to speak the truth as he
knows it-whatever the target believes to be true is considered
the truth for the purpose of the spell. The target may choose not
to speak or to withhold information, but he cannot deliberately lie.
UCAS and CAS courts consider the use of the compel truth
spell to extract confessions a violation of a suspect's right against
self-incrimination. However, some of the Native American Nations
(notably the Sioux) have been known to permit judicial shamans
to use this spell (among others) to get to the truth.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]L
FALSE MEMORY
The false memory spell enables the spellcaster to create and
implant a false memory in the mind of a target. The spell may
implant a completely new memory, or modify an existing memory and change how the subject remembers a particular event or
piece of information.
A subject cannot distinguish between successfully implanted
memories and his real memories. However, the gamemaster
secretly makes a Spell Resistance Test for the subject each time he
"recalls" the false memory. Tally the subject's successes. When that tally exceeds the number of successes the spellcaster
achieved on his initial Spell Test, the spell's effect ends. The subject recognizes the implanted memory as false and recalls any real
memories obscured by false ones.
Type: Mana
Range: Limited
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Permanent (20 turns)
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
POSSESSION
The possession spell enables a magician to enter a target's
body with his own consciousness and control the target's body. If
the target fails his Willpower Resistance Test and the spellcaster's
Spell Success Test succeeds, the caster falls into a trance state and
his consciousness takes control of the target's body.
The spellcaster may use the subject's physical skills with a +2
modifier for all tests for the duration of the spell. The occupying
magician uses his own mental skills, but he cannot use his magic
skills. Damage to the body of the target or the spellcaster affects
the spellcaster's target numbers for any further tests made while
in the body.
If the subject dies during the spell, the spellcaster must resist
8D Stun damage or die himself. If the spellcaster's body dies, the
spellcaster dies with it and the spell is broken. Subjects have no
memory of the time the spell was in effect.
*The use of this very powerful spell could easily upset the balance of the game if not handled carefully by the gamemaster. The
gamemaster should use great discretion in allowing this spell in
his game.
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 3]S
TERRORIZE
The terrorize spell fills a single target with fear of the spellcaster. If the target cannot resist the spell's effects with a
Willpower Resistance Test, he or she is overcome with fear and
must flee from the spellcaster as quickly as possible. Once out of
sight of the spellcaster, the subject may make a Willpower Test
each round to overcome the effects of the spell.
Type: Mana
Target: Willpower (R)
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
TELEKINETIC MANIPULATIONS
CATFALL
The catfall spell psychokinetically slows a target's fall and
ensures that the subject lands upright. Multiply the Spell Test successes by the magician's Magic Attribute to determine the maximum distance in meters that the subject may fall without danger
of injury. If the subject falls a greater distance, subtract the maximum distance of the spell from the distance fallen before calculating damage.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]L
DEFLECT
The deflect spell psychokinetically deflects physical missile
attacks against a target. Every 2 successes the spellcaster achieves
on his Spell Success Test provides the target with an additional
Combat Pool die that the target can use only for Damage
Resistance Tests against physical ranged attacks (the deflect spell
does not protect against energy attacks such as lasers or energy
manipulation spells).
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]S
FLING
The fling spell enables the spellcaster to psychokinetically hurl
a single object at a target. The hurled object's weight in kilograms
may not exceed the spellcaster's Magic Attribute. The object is
thrown with a Strength equal to the spell's Force. The caster must
touch the item to be thrown.
Treat the spellcaster's Spell Success Test as a normal rangedattack test to determine if the item hits the target. Throwing
weapons propelled by the fling spell travel the standard range for
the weapon type, based on the spell's Force.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: Ranged Attack Test
Duration: Instant
Drain: (F + 2)M
GECKO CRAWL
The gecko crawl spell enables a voluntary subject to crawl
along vertical surfaces at half his normal Quickness Rating. Gravity
still affects the subject, who falls if he jumps or pushes away from
the vertical surface he is climbing on. If the subject is climbing a
particularly slick surface, the gamemaster also may require him to
make appropriate Athletics (Climbing) Tests.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
TRANSFORMATION MANIPULATIONS
ALTER TEMPERATURE
The alter temperature spell is an area-effect spell that
changes the ambient temperature. The spell alters the area's temperature by 5 degrees centigrade for every 2 successes on the
spellcaster's Spell Success Test. The spellcaster chooses whether
the temperature increases or decreases.
The gamemaster determines the effects of any extreme temperatures caused by the spell. Generally, sufficiently extreme temperatures cause characters without proper protection to suffer 4L
Stun damage for each minute of exposure. The gamemaster may
also determine that extreme temperatures interfere with the
operation of some machines.
Type: Physical
Range: Limited
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
BUG BARRIER
The bug barrier spell, created by Knight-Errant combat mages
for use against insect spirits, creates a magical shield with effects
similar to those of a mana barrier spell (p. 158, SRII). The barrier's
Barrier Rating is equal to the spell's Force and blocks only insect
spirits.
Additionally, the shield causes a painful magical feedback in
any insect spirit that comes in contact with it. The feedback has a
base Damage Code of (Force)L. Every 2 successes on the caster's
initial Spell Test increases the base damage by 1 level. This damage is in addition to any resulting from astral combat with the barrier itself.
Type: Mana
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]D
CLEAN AIR
The clean air spell is an area effect spell that clears all impurities from the air in the affected area, leaving the air clean and
breathable. The gamemaster determines the target number for the
Spell Success Test based on the airborne impurities present.
Target numbers of 3 or 4 would be appropriate for smoke, fog and
similar impurities, while complex nerve toxins might require target numbers as high as 10 or 12.
If this spell is cast on an open area where the air is moving
(windy conditions), it clears only one area, which quickly mixes
with the surrounding air.
Type: Physical
Range: Limited
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]S
CLEAN WATER
The clean water spell is an area-effect spell that removes
impurities from a volume of water equal to a sphere with a radius
equal to the spellcaster's Magic Attribute in meters. The
gamemaster determines the target number for the Spell Success
Test, based on the impurities in the water (3 for dirt and organic
sediment, as high as 10 for industrial chemicals).
If this spell is cast on an open body of water, such as a river,
it clears only one area, which quickly mixes with the surrounding
water.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Permanent (10 turns)
Drain: (F + 2)S
CONTROL FIRE
The control fire spell enables the spellcaster to control normal
flames within his line of sight. The caster makes his Spell Success
Test against a target number equal to the Power of the flames. The
gamemaster determines the strength of the fire by the nature of
the fire's fuel and how long it has burned. While small camp fires
or individual burning items have a Power of 3 or 4, the Power of
flames consuming a building or forest fire might be as high as 15
to 20.
The caster can cause the flames to move up to 1 meter per
success, provided the area of movement contains fuel for the
flames. He may also cause the flames to flare, increasing their
Power by 1 for every 2 successes. The spellcaster may also choose
to contain the flames where they are and allow them to burn out.
Though this spell does not affect magically sustained flames
(such as fire elementals or firewall spells), it does affect flames created by spells such as ignite and the elemental effects of similar
physical spells.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: Power Rating
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
EXTINGUISH FIRE
The extinguish fire spell is an area-effect spell that extinguishes fires. The caster makes his Spell Success Test against a target number equal to the Power of the flames. The gamemaster
determines the strength of the fire by the nature of the fire's fuel
and how long it has burned. While small camp fires or individual
burning items have a Power of 3 or 4, the Power of flames consuming a building or forest might be as high as 15 to 20.
Every 2 successes reduces the fire's Damage Level by 1 level,
beginning at (Power)M. However, the fire regains 1 Damage Level
per Combat Turn up to its initial strength. If the spellcaster
achieves enough successes to reduce the Damage Level of the fire
to 0, the fire is extinguished.
The extinguish fire spell has no effect on magically sustained
fires (such as flame barriers or fire elementals) but does affect fires
set by magical means such as ignite spells.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: Power
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]S
FIREWALL
The firewall spell creates a wall of fire. The wall's height in
meters equals the spell's Force, and its length or radius equals the
magician's Magic Attribute. The firewall causes (Force)M damage
to anything that comes in contact with it and provides full visual
cover for anyone behind it. A firewall is not solid and does not
block attacks, though it detonates explosives and other munitions
that pass through it.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]D
FIX
The fix spell repairs cracks, rips, tears, fractures and other
damage to inanimate objects. The weight of the item may not
exceed the spellcaster's Magic Attribute in kilograms, and the
character must have all the pieces of the object. To use the spell,
the caster must achieve a single success on a Spell Success Test
against the appropriate target number from the Object Resistance
Table (p. 130, SRII). This spell makes only physical repairs, and will
not restore magical bonds or properties of any kind.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Permanent (10 turns)
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
FLAME AURA
The flame aura spell creates a rippling aura of flames around
a voluntary target. The flame aura extends from the subject a
number of centimeters equal to the spell's Force. The flames cause
no harm to the target of the spell or anything carried or worn by
the target.
Any successful melee attack against the subject inflicts damage on the attacker from the intense heat and flame. The attacker
must resist (Force)M damage. Armor reduces the damage if the
attacker strikes with an armored part of his body. When the target
of the flame aura spell makes a successful melee attack, increase
the Power of the Damage Code by 2.
Type: Physical
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Range: Limited
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]M
FREEZE WATER
The freeze water spell has an area effect that freezes all water
in the spell's area of effect into ice. If the spell is used in a large
body of water, such as a lake or ocean, it freezes all of the water
in range, creating a free-floating iceberg. Water freezing in containers or pipes may cause them to burst from the sudden expansion. Ice created by the spell melts normally according to the
ambient temperature.
The freeze water spell does not affect the water that makes
up living beings, manifested water spirits or water elementals.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]S
GLUE
The glue spell magically causes two inanimate surfaces to
bond together with a Force equal to the spell's Force Rating plus
1 for every 2 successes on the spellcaster's Spell Success Test. To
separate the surfaces, a character must make a successful Strength
Test against a target number equal to the Force of the bond. If
either surface has a Barrier Rating lower than the Force of the
bond, that surface is torn apart when the surfaces are separated.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
HEAT SHIELD
The heat shield spell creates a barrier that offers the target
some protection from fire- and heat-based attacks resulting from
flame projection, firebolt, fireball, hellblast, flame bolt and flame
bomb spells, as well as other flame spells, flame powers, flame
throwers and similar weapons. Subtract the heat shield spell's
Force Rating from the Power of such attacks when determining
damage.
The heat shield spell does not protect against the ignite spell
or anything that lights a fire.
A magician casting the personal form of this spell must resist
Drain of [(F + 2) + 2]L.
Type: Physical
Range: Limited
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]M
LIGHT RAY
The light ray spell fires a beam of light at a target with effects
comparable to those of a laser weapon. At the gamemaster's discretion, the light ray spell may produce elemental light effects
(see p. 132).
Type: Mana
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Damage Level: S
Duration: Instant
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]D
MENTAL SHIELD
The mental shield spell provides protection against spells and
powers that affect the mind, such as mind probe and control
manipulation spells, mana-based illusions, and critter powers such
as influence and desire reflection. For every 2 successes on the
spellcaster's Spell Test, the subject gains 1 extra die to resist the
effects of the listed spells.
The mental shield spell does not protect against mana-type
combat spells.
Type: Mana
Target: 4
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
Range: LOS
MIST
The mist spell is an area-effect spell that creates a thick mist.
The dense mist imposes the vision penalties for heavy fog (see the
Visibility Table, p. 89, SRII). The fog persists as long as the spell is
sustained. When the spell is dropped, the mist dissipates quickly,
based on the surrounding temperature, winds and other climactic
conditions.
Type: Physical
Range: Limited
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
NET
The net spell is an area-effect version of the bind spell (p.
131, Grimoire II). The spell traps and holds any target in the area
of effect, though targets may resist the spell by making a
Quickness Test against a target number equal to the spell's Force.
The Barrier Rating for the magical "net" created by the spell is
equal to the spellcaster's net successes.
Targets may break out of the net according to the standard
barrier rules, or may attempt to do so through extraordinary
effort. To break out under his own power, a character may increase
his Strength Attribute for this purpose by making a Strength Test
against a target number equal to the spell's Force. Every 2 successes on the test increase his Strength Attribute by 1. After
breaking free, the character must make a Body Test to resist
(Character's Strength)L Stun damage, representing the fatigue
caused by his efforts.
Type: Physical
Target: Quickness (R)
Range: LOS
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]D
SAP STRENGTH
The sap strength spell reduces a living or inanimate target's
strength. For every 2 successes on the spellcaster's Spell Test,
reduce a living target's Strength Attribute by 1. If the Attribute is
reduced to 0 or less, the subject is immobilized, unable to support
the weight of his own body.
Against inanimate targets, compare the number of successes
the spellcaster achieved in the Spell Test to the Barrier Rating of
the target. If the successes exceed the Barrier Rating, the target
collapses.
Type: Physical
Target: 6
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]S
SHAPE EARTH
The shape earth spell allows the spellcaster to magically
move and shape a quantity of earth in the spell's area of effect. A
successful Spell Test against an appropriate target number from
the Object Resistance Table (p. 130, SRII) allows the spellcaster to
rapidly dig or fill holes, tunnels and trenches, push over earthen
barricades, and perform other, similar feats. The spell also works
on processed materials such as glass, metal and concrete. Any
material the spellcaster reshapes reverts to its previous shape
when the spell is dropped.
Type: Physical
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Sustained
Range: LOS
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]D
SHAPE WATER
The shape water spell works in the same manner as shape
earth spell, but affects water and other liquids.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]D
SMOKE CLOUD
The smoke cloud spell creates a cloud of thick, sulfurous
smoke that covers an area with a radius in meters equal to the
spellcaster's Magic Attribute. Each Combat Turn, the cloud inflicts
Stun damage on all targets within the spell's area of effect, and
adds 4 to all sight-based target numbers for tests made in the
affected area. Armor does not reduce the damage, but a sealed
breathing apparatus or air filter negates it entirely.
Type: Physical
Range: LOS
Target: 4
Damage Level: M
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 3]D
SPIRIT BARRIER
The spirit barrier spell is an area-effect spell that functions like
a mana barrier spell. However, the spirit barrier spell affects only
spirits and other astral entities, such as astrally projecting magicians. All other creatures and objects, including dual-natured
creatures or bonded magical items, can pass through the barrier
normally. The spirit barrier's Barrier Rating is equal to one-half the
spell's Force. Add the Barrier Rating to the target numbers of all
Spell Tests for magicians attempting to cast spells through the barrier.
Type: Mana
Target: 6
Range: Limited
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 2]M
TEMPER
The temper spell alters inanimate materials to make them
stronger. Make a Spell Success Test against an appropriate target
number from the Object Resistance Table (p.130, SRII). For every
success on the Spell Test, increase the Barrier Rating of the item
by 2. The weight of the tempered object in kilograms may not
exceed twice the spellcaster's Magic Attribute.
Type: Physical
Range: Touch
Target: Object Resistance
Duration: Sustained
Drain: [(F + 2) + 1]M
WIND
The wind spell is an area-effect spell that produces a wind in
whatever direction the caster desires. The strength of the wind is
equal to the Force of the spell. The wind scatters light objects such
as paper and leaves. Freestanding items with a Barrier Rating
lower than the spell's Force are knocked over. Living targets in the
area of effect must make a Knockdown Test against a target number equal to the Force of the spell.

HOUNGAN (MAMBO)
"Papa Legba watches over the path you walked to find me.
You need more than the help of some bocor magician, you need
one who knows the world of les invisibles, who can speak with les
Mysteres. I am such a one.
"Tell me your desire. I will call up the loa and seek their wisdom. If what you ask is in accord with their wishes, I can help you.
If you believe in and honor their power, the loa will grant me the
strength to be used in your cause. But know that the loa must be
fed, and the price will not be small."
Commentary
The houngan is a magician who follows the path of the loa (a
female houngan is often called a mambo). The houngan is primarily concerned with serving the loa well, for they are the wellspring
of all life. If the loa guide the houngan into the world of the shadows, she will go there without question.

STREET WARRIOR
"I know it's the image, but I wouldn't call myself a loner.
Sure, I like a certain amount of time to myself, to meditate and
focus, but the rhythm and bounce of the sprawl energizes me. I
see chaos and unending flow in every motion, every noise, every
action and reaction. But all that confusion and chaos has a pattern
to it-an order of sorts.
"Okay, okay; so I've contributed a little to that confusion
myself on more than one occasion. I consider it my humanitarian
duty to see that things don't get boring. I also consider it my duty
to see that everybody plays fair. That's the big red button for me,
chummers. Play nice, and I'll stay nice too."
Commentary
The street warrior is a magician, though he prefers to call
himself an adept. He focuses his power toward improving,
enhancing and amplifying his own natural abilities. He's barely
aware of the magic except at certain times, usually when the
adrenaline is pumping and everything is on the line. Then he feels
the power of his own unique magic. Beginning street warriors
tend to focus on the martial arts, but any physical ability will do.

GHOST HUNTER
"Let's dispense with the usual posturing. We both know you
would have handled this problem by conventional means if you
could have. People only talk to me once they've eliminated mundane solutions to their problems, so there's no need for either of
us to pretend that some other avenue is an option.
"Fortunately for you, I enjoy a challenge. And my abilities let
me deal with the unusual as easily as you deal with the everyday.
Let's hear your problem. Then I'll tell you just how much of a challenge I think it will be-and how much it will cost you."
Commentary
The ghost hunter is a physical adept who specializes in dealing with things of the astral: spirits, spells and paranormal critters.
He may hunt down a rogue spirit or other creature that's causing
trouble, or work to protect his client from some magical threat. In
any case, no one should underestimate his ability to deal with
problems traditionally handled by hermetics and shamans.
