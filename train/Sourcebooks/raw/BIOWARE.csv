ST-???,"Adrenal Pump 1",1.25,60000,3.00,"+1QCK,+1STR,+1WIL,+2RCT","The adrenal pump is a small, muscular sac implanted in the lower abdominal cavity and connected to each of the two suprarenal (or adrenal) glands. When dormant, the pump concentrates and serves as a reservoir for the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline. When activated, the sac contracts, sending a surge of concentrates into the bloodstream. Stress and other emotional states such as anger, fear, or lust will also activate the pump.\n\nAs the effects produced by hormones depend both on the amount secreted and the responsiveness of the organ or tissue in question, the actual combat effectiveness of the adrenal pump is variable. Once active, roll 1D6 for each level of the adrenal pump; the die result indicates the number of turns the hormones is up in the blood, and, therefore, the number of turns the bonuses will apply. Each level of the pump adds +1 to Quickness, +1 to Strength, +1 to Willpower, and +2 to Reaction for as long as the concentrates remain in the bloodstream. (Quickness raised in this manner does not also affect Reaction.) When that time has expired, however, the subject takes Deadly stun damage with a Power Level equal to one-half the number of turns the hormones remained in the blood (round down) and a Staging of 2 because of system shock and fatigue. For example, after four rounds of hormone-activation, the attack would be 2D2 Stun. The character may roll Body dice to resist the damage.\n\nOnce the adrenal pump has discharged its load, it takes approximately 10 to 15 minutes (9+1 D6) for the pump to regenerate its supply. If the pump activates before the sac has been refilled, halve the regular number of turns active (but not the fatigue aftereffects). The pump cannot discharge more than once during the same encounter. Studies have shown that high levels of adrenaline and noradrenaline in the bloodstream contribute to high blood pressure; speculation based on available data also points toward higher incidences of cardiac-related problems stemming from long-term use. When the pump is working, subjects are also more prone to critical heart failure through sheer overexertion. If a character whose adrenal pump is activated completely fails a Body Success Test (rolling all ones), he suffers immediate cardiac arrest (heart attack/Deadly physical and mental damage).\n\nAlthough normally triggered involuntarily, the adrenal pump can also be triggered on demand through the use of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH/corticotrophin); inhalers with six doses can be acquired from various sources (see Compounds, p. 89, for more details).\n\nThe Reaction increase does not affect the skills involved in rigging or decking. To activate or resist the activation of the pump, the character makes a Willpower (6) Test. A light wound of any kind automatically activates the pump, assuming the character is aware of the damage."

Subjects with a Level 1 booster gain +1 to their Intelligence Attribute; a Level 2 booster adds +2 to the recipient's Intelligence. The Intelligence bonus from a Level 1 booster is not cumulative with that given by a level 2 booster, however. The more advanced booster-2 has the additional advantage of a Task Pool. The levels of a Task Pool can temporarily add dice to a success test. (If a subject has a Task Pool of 1, for example, he may temporarily raise a skill level by +1 for a single test.) The Task Pool refreshes along with the other pools. Technical, Knowledge, and B/R skills are the only skills that can be modified by the Task Pool.

For example, to remember that a car was involved in an accident, the Target Number is 2; it is 3 to remember that the car was red, a 4 to remember the model, a 5 to recall that the driver was male, an 8 to remember seeing the long scratch on the side, and so on—assuming that the character noticed the detail in the first place.\n\nElapsed time is also an important factor in how difficult or easy it is to remember a particular fact. Apply -1 to the Target Number if the event occurred within the past hour, +0 if within 24 hours, +1 for one week or less, +2 if within the month, +3 if within three months, +4 within four months, +5 within eight months, and so on.\n\nComplexity of the item may also affect the Target Number. A single word with great personal significance might subtract -3 from the Target Number, while a complex passage from a poem once memorized in high school may be +4 or greater."

Activation and deactivation of the editor is a learned reflex. When the editor is voluntarily triggered, the individual is no longer subject to any sensations of pain, including feedback pain. With the pain editor active, neither mental damage nor fatigue can render the character unconscious. Because the character can no longer perceive pain, the gamemaster marks off both physical and mental damage inflicted on the character, but does it out of the player's sight. Note that the character is unaware even of attacks that hit (bullet wounds, a knife stab, and so on), unless he can perceive them in ways other than by pain or tactile sensation. He might, for example, see the weapon hit, note a big spreading spot of red on his white shirt, and so forth. Initiative and target number penalties accompanying mental damage are ignored; penalties resulting from physical damage are applied, but without the player's knowledge (the modifiers would give away the current damage condition). Until the pain editor is actively disengaged, the character (and player) will have no idea of his current damage status. Until he collapses, that is.\n\nDamage is taken and calculated normally. The only difference is that the character remains unaware of the pain involved in being wounded or fatigued. The effects of any sustained damage (initiative and target number penalties or unconsciousness) are applied when the pain editor is \"switched off.\" In addition to the pain-blocking feature, the subject gains a +1 to Willpower when the editor is activated, but suffers a -1 Intelligence loss for the duration.

Only a few molecules of the pheromone are required to trigger the effect, but no matter how low the concentration of secreted pheromone, all persons in the area of dispersion are affected equally. Dispersion is largely dependent on atmospheric conditions. Under average conditions (an open area with little or no wind), the area of effect extends from the source of the released pheromones in a circle whose diameter is approximately 15 to 20 meters. Mild air currents can increase the area covered, but stronger winds will disperse the pheromones before they can take effect.\n\nThe effectiveness of pheromones depends on the olfactory system of the targets; pheromones have no effect on individuals with impaired olfactory abilities or those unable to use their sense of smell (e.g., astral travelers). Pheromones are also species-specific; although human and metahuman pheromones are similar, pheromones will have no effect on non-humanoid creatures. (In related species, such as human to metahumans, and metahumans to different metahumans, halve the effect of the pheromones, rounding down.) Being individually discrete, pheromone augmentation continues to function even if the character is in the presence of another character with tailored pheromones. Every level of tailored pheromones adds a +1 to the recipient's Charisma and Social Skill Tests. Cultured pheromones are exceptionally powerful; double the normally acquired benefits, and extend ranges by an additional 50 percent.\n\nTailored pheromones have no effect on astral or conjuring abilities and skills."
ST-???,"Toxin Exhaler",0.6,30000,3.00,"","A toxin exhaler is a sac lined with specialized and genetically tailored cells that is implanted in the neck above the larynx (voice box). The cells that line the sac are gengineered to produce a single specific toxin of the recipient's choice. The toxin is stored in the sac until the character wishes to expel the toxin outward. The toxin is expelled by triggering \"learned\" reflexes; essentially, a massive contraction of the diaphragm, followed by an immediate relaxation, causes a sudden deep breath, followed by a strong exhaling action. The sphincters, which normally keep the sac closed, open slightly during the exhalation, and the resulting effect is much like an aerosol. In average atmospheric conditions (an open area with little or no wind), the cone of effect is similar to an equilateral triangle measuring two meters on each side.\n\nThe sac can manufacture only one type of toxin, the one the recipient chooses prior to implantation. Except for removal and replacement of the sac, the toxin cannot be changed or altered once implanted. To prevent accidental injury from the internalized toxin, the character is also partially \"immunized\" against the toxin. If exposed to the same specific toxin (even if it comes from other sources), the character receives double his \"natural\" Body Rating (no augmentation) to resist.\n\nThe character makes a Quickness (4) Test to hit an intended target. Add +1 to the Target Number per one-half meter to the target. Maximum range equals one-half the unaugmented Body Attribute of the implanted character (round down) in meters."
ST-???,"Toxin Extractor 1",0.2,24000,1.00,"","As the main site of catabolism, or the breakdown of complex substances, in the body, the liver is the prime site of defense against potentially toxic compounds and drugs. The toxin extractor is a specially cultivated cluster of cells implanted in the liver to greatly improve the efficiency and to expand the spectrum of catabolic activity. Potential toxins that make their way into the bloodstream are filtered out in the liver, and, with the aid of the extractor, are broken down into harmless fragments and then expelled. A subject with an extractor can reduce the Power Level of a blood-borne toxin attack by 1 point for every two levels of extractor in the body. For example, in a 5D2 blood-toxin attack, a character with a level 4 toxin extractor would resist against a 3D2 Damage Code. The maximum level of toxin extractor that can be implanted is equal to the character's unaugmented Body Attribute."
ST-???,"Tracheal Filter 1",0.2,30000,1.00,"","Traps and filters are implanted at the top of the trachea just below the larynx (voice box). This cluster of specialized tissue absorbs airborne impurities and keeps them from reaching and subsequently affecting the lungs. Solid matter (smoke, pollen, dust, and so on) is easily blocked and expelled with outgoing breath. Gaseous compounds are rendered inert or less effective through the various chemical reactions performed by the filters. Though breathing becomes difficult, the subject will suffer fewer ill-effects (unless the gas itself is inert). Impurities of bacterial size and smaller are not affected by tracheal filters. Each level of filter acts to resist non-microbiological air-vectored attacks. Reduce the Power Level of such an attack by one-half the level of the filter (round down) of the character making the Resistance Test. That is, against a SS2 gaseous stock, an individual with a Level 4 tracheal filter resists against a 352 Damage Code."
ST-???,"Trauma Damper",0.4,40000,2.00,"","A damper is a clump of specialized receptors, implanted at the base of the thalamus, near the midbrain. Upon receiving sensory information indicating fatigue, pain, or physical trauma, the damper triggers the release of concentrated endorphins and enkephalins (naturally produced opiates and painkillers). This may not remove or aid in the repair of physical damage, but at times it may keep the character alive or conscious enough to deal directly with the cause of the inflicted damage. If the damage (per wound) is physical, shift one box of the indicated Damage Level from Physical to Mental; if the trauma stems from a mental cause, subtract one box from the indicated damage. A trauma damper adds +2 to the target numbers needed to resist pain (e.g., Body or Willpower Tests versus the symptoms by torture), or it applies a -2 modifier to the target numbers needed to resist pain (e.g., Body or Willpower Tests versus the symptoms of a painful disease).\n\nBecause of the feedback-driven nature of the trauma damper, it cannot function properly when used in conjunction with an activated pain editor, and, under certain conditions, a damage compensator. In characters implanted with a damage compensator, the trauma damper will operate properly only when the compensator's ability to handle both Physical and Mental Damage has been exceeded (i.e., when the compensator fails because of excessive damage)."
