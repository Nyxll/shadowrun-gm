MERCENARY OPERATIONS
I am a mercenary.
>>>>>(As a point of interest, Juan Samuel Pererya posts in these parts under the handle
Matador. If I'm not mistaken, he's posting these days from a Peruvian hospital (or some similar place). A few of his postings appear in the Field Pack section of this upload-which, oddly
enough, seems to have been compiled backwards. The Field Pack equipment section is an
older posting; you can tell by the dates. Who knows why it ended up second in the file
sequence? I don't know if Matador will post comments on his own work, but it'll be more interesting if he does.) <<<<<

>>>>>(By the way, since this is a public posting (to be echoed after the usual annotation) I
expect a lot of non-mercs to be perusing these pages. A non-merc myself, I found the contents
interesting stuff. I've read through it once, and log back in every so often to annotate it myself
where necessary.
I think this material is of value to everyone, not just mercs. Pererya says a lot in here about
how we should act and behave toward each other (shadowrunners take note!), so pay attention. Professionalism shouldn't be limited to self-proclaimed professionals. It's a code we should
all follow. Lord knows I'd feel safer walking the shadow-streets if we did.) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (03:19:50/01-04-54)
One of the dictionaries on my computer defines the term mercenary in two ways: a) One who
works or acts merely for money or other reward, or b) A professional soldier serving in a foreign
army solely for pay.
I cannot dispute the letter of what each says.
I once asked a young relative of mine (who believed I
worked in the international import/export business, an
old and respected cover) what he thought the term "mercenary" meant. He told me mercenaries were people who
went someplace else and killed people for money.
I cannot honestly dispute his definition.
>>>>>(Yeah, no drek you can't. Wonder why?) <<<<<
-Smiley (21:17:17/01-04-55)
>>>>>(Shut up and read, sludge brain.) <<<<<
-Weasel (03:29:16/01-06-55)
I can, however, explain what the term mercenary
means to me. This may take some time, so bear with me.
WHAT IS A MERCENARY?
I am a soldier, pure and simple. I am trained in the
ways of modern warfare and schooled in the theories of
the ancients. I do what people who consider themselves
humane believe is unnecessary in our modern world.
I use force to accomplish an end.
It's a simple, age-old problem. You want something
done. Someone or something stands in your way. But
what you want done is important. It cannot be left
undone. What do you do? What alternatives do you
have? What price will you pay to achieve your goal?
>>>>>(He makes a valid point, one a lot of people tend to
forget. What happens when negotiating doesn't work?
We've become so afraid of war, or, more precisely, its price
in blood, that we knee jerk toward negotiation and compromise. Unfortunately, talking sometimes just doesn't work,
especially when someone wants something very badly.
There's a remake of some old pop tune making the
rounds these days, and one of its lyrics goes something like
this: "I don't know no military solution that didn't end up as
something worse." Sorry, chummer, whoever you were-like
it or not, I can think of plenty that did what they were supposed to do.) <<<<<
-Conjoiner (20:51:54/01-03-55)
>>>>>(Yeah, but isn't it a good thing that we so quickly
reject a military solution? Isn't prudence sometimes better?
Many military solutions have failed, and with disastrous
results, because the people in charge thought they understood what was going on and only succeeded in making
things worse. Maybe thinking twice and trying everything
else three times isn't such a bad thing.) <<<<<
-Findler-man (03:28:16/01-05-55)
Some people would have you believe that only two
alternatives exist: peace and war. Though we can learn
much from the practice of Taoism and the wisdom of the
ancients, things are not always as simple as wet or dry,
white or black, soft or hard, peace or war. Sometimes you
have both.
That's where I come in.
A mercenary's job involves much more than simply
waging war on someone else's payroll. War is pain and
death and misery. War is not something humans desire. It
is, however, something we must accept when there are
no alternatives. If we believe strongly that something
must be done, we may have to fight for it. By the same
token, if we do not believe strongly, we should not fight.
But we must make that decision before we begin. Once
we begin, we can't turn back.
Force must be applied with intelligence. Anyone can
fire a submachine gun into a crowd. Anyone can push a
button and launch a missile that slaughters a hundred
children. Anyone can kill. It's easy.
A mercenary knows how to kill. He also knows when
not to kill. He knows that sometimes, simply being strong
is enough. He knows that the threat of violence can bring
about peace-time and again, history has proved this
truth. He knows that one man or group of men in the
right place at the right time can save hundreds from
death.
He also knows that sometimes, talking isn't enough.
And he stands ready for that moment.
>>>>>(Yeah, he loves that moment. He sits in the dark,
quivering, waiting for that moment.) <<<<<
-Smiley (21:19:08/01-04-55)
>>>>>(Geez, what's with you?) <<<<<
-Weasel (03:31:54/01-06-55)
BEING A MERCENARY
Not everyone is cut out to be a mercenary.
It takes a certain kind of individual to be a mercenary.
A mercenary understands herself, her abilities, and her
limitations. She knows her role in the world, what she is
expected to do, and what lies outside her responsibility.
She can dream, but holds no illusions about reality. Most
of all, she understands the intelligent application of force.
As dangerous and horrific as it can be, she understands it
as a valuable and effective tool.
She understands people. She knows how their minds
work, how they think when they are calm, how they react
when they are afraid. She understands what people want,
from basic sustenance to decadent luxury, and she knows
the lengths to which people will go to get what they
want. She knows how to reason with others, how to
explain her own and her opponent's position, how to listen and make others listen.
The mercenary is always prepared. She knows her equipment and her weapons. She knows what she needs and
where to get it. She knows the requirements of her assignment and the equipment needed to get the job done.
>>>>>(I'll attest to that! We've stopped getting our combat gear through our local fixer, and now use one of our
teammate's old merc contacts, his dealer. Takes longer,
and sometimes pickups get a little complicated, but the
quality of the stuff that shows up is first-rate.) <<<<<
-Wenton Warrior (08:27:40/01-06-55)
Above everything else, the mercenary knows her job.
She's analyzed it, dissected it, and put it back together in
every possible combination. She knows what's supposed
to happen and what might happen, and she's prepared
for those times when things don't go as expected.
She is a professional.
>>>>>(Professional what? (yuck hyuck)) <<<<<
-Smiley (21:23:54/01-04-55)

trace and burn your butt from here to Kansas City.) <<<<<

BASIC OPERATIONS
Many people mistakenly believe that because a mercenary works freelance, he does not live by any rules. In
fact, mercenaries are professionals, and like all professionals, live by a certain set of rules. A mercenary must value
and practice personal discipline, interpersonal skills, preparedness, and controlled orientation and exposure. I
touched on these requirements in a general way already,
but because these issues lie at the heart of being a mercenary, this next section expounds on each requirement in
detail.
These abilities are the basics, the things you must
know, digest, and make your own before you begin your
career as a mercenary. Even seasoned professionals need
to review these basics from time to time, because the
years of work tend to make you forget. Never forget.
PERSONAL DISCIPLINE
I live by a code. Most mercenaries do. A merc without a personal code is nothing more than a sociopath
with no concern beyond himself. Mercenaries are not
madmen.
>>>>>(Some might argue that point, but this is not the
forum in which to contest it. Personally, I think there's a little something loose in the head of anyone who chooses
the life of a merc-or one in the shadows, for that matter.) <<<<< .
-Normal PEE (21:39:02/01-05-55)
The process of discovering your code, what you will
and will not allow yourself to do, takes a lifetime's worth
of learning. It never ends, for any of us.
Before you choose the mercenary's life, you must
determine your own code. Find out where you believe
the lines are drawn. This knowledge is very important.
>>>>>(It is not just important. It's mandatory. If you don't
establish a code for your life, you'll soon find yourself flopping compulsively from cause to cause, caring less and
less about human life. God, is it important. Find your
code. Live by it.) <<<<<
-Winter Rat (23:19:20/01-06-55)
I became comfortable with my code many years ago,
but i know that I am an exception to the rule. I became a
mercenary for my own reasons. Though my history shares
much with that of other mercenaries, certain, singular
things in my heart and mind define me. They color everything that happens to me and shape the way I see the
world. Every person possesses individual, unusual perspectives and thoughts that shape his or her world view. Find
yours and learn what they mean as quickly as you can.
Because my experience may help others formulate
their own codes, or at least give them something to think
about, I'm writing down the broadest precepts of my personal code. I keep the specifics nailed down in my head,
but those won't matter to anyone except me.
>>>>>(If Matador's specifics do matter to you, here's a tidbit-Matador is Mexican. Note that I said Mexican, not
Aztlaner. That distinction is important.) <<<<<
-Night Hunter (02:19:14/01-08-55)
·I take only jobs I believe in. Before I contract for a
job, I learn all I can about the work and the situation, and
not just from the client. I do my own research and learn
as much of the truth as possible. Sometimes, especially
with secret operations, I can't learn much. In those situations I trust my fixer. He and I have a long-established
relationship; he knows me and knows the kind of jobs I
won't do.
>>>>>(Basically, learn when to say NO! It's easy, really,
and ultimately it earns you a lot of respect. Don't get
caught on some testosterone wave and take a job
because your machismo demands it. If your guts don't
like it, turn it down.) <<<<<
-Uncle Paul (11:08:47/01-06-55)
.I do not take jobs offered solely because of my ability
to kill. I am not a professional killer. Though killing is often
part of my profession, I cannot be hired exclusively to kill.
I admit that his part of my code may wander into a gray
area, because I have done wet work in the past and will
probably do it again. (Wet work, for those who don't
know, is assassination for hire.) But I am not a professional
assassin. The wet work I've performed has always been
one element of a larger operation, admittedly sometimes
the principal objective of that operation. The difference
between me and a professional assassin lies in the first
part of my code. I take only jobs I believe in. If performing a job I believe in means people must die, I accept
this. I live with it.
>>>>>(Notice the important subtext running through
much of this abstract: Kill only when necessary. I prefer to
forget the number of runs I've been on that were filled
with gratuitous killing. I don't work with jokers like that
twice. Few people do, because soon they'll have so
many corps and cops after them that no one will want to
hire them. Don't kill unless you have to. Non-lethal tactics
work just as well as lethal ones most times, and don't create the same kind of enemies.) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (04:10:18/01-08-55)
.I am not judge, jury, and executioner. I am not the
law. The society and civilization we live in accepts some
things and reviles others. I make my judgment calls
based on the precepts of that society. Are the objectives
of my job acceptable or even beneficial to society as a
whole? Am I helping to advance some worthy cause? If
not, I don't take the job, or I refuse to fulfill the objective.
I live and work by my conscience and my code.
·I walk away if things change. Sometimes, the truth is
different from the inside. Once an operation begins, certain things become evident that could not be seen before.
If this new truth changes the way I view an operation so
that I would not have taken the operation if I had known
those truths going in, I will walk away from that operation. I have walked away, and it has cost me money,
prestige, work, and friendships. I make sure my employer
understands this part of my code before I begin the operation. My attitude has affected the kind of jobs I get and
given me a certain reputation. I like that.
·I value all human life. I value both friend and foe. I
will not betray my friends or my allies for the "cause."
Yes, I sometimes need to make hard decisions, but I will
not work with the knowledge that those decisions must
be made as part of the operation.
I especially value the life of my opposition. You'll
note that I don't say "enemy." I do not assume my opponent is my enemy. My opponents believe, perhaps as
strongly as I do, that they are doing something important. They have values, a code perhaps, and most important, they also have lives. I have no inherent right to take
that life. Don't misunderstand me: I fully understand that
killing may be required, but I will not kill needlessly. Yes,
I consider injury a viable alternative to death. I would
gladly injure someone, even permanently disable them,
to remove that person as a threat rather than kill them.
Killing may not be necessary, but it does come with the
territory.
Have I ever violated my code? Yes. It troubled me
deeply every time. But I'm glad it disturbs me to do so.
That's how I know I'm human.
>>>>>(I know Matador, and I envy him his code. Many people in our line of work wrestle with their consciences almost
daily, and that constant struggle makes me wonder why
some people become mercenaries. For the glory? There
isn't much. For the thrill? Too many
get involved this way. For the money?
Become an accountant. The corps
always need more accountants.
Personally, the Euro-Wars left me
without a place in society. Combat
affected me so deeply that the scars
from what I'd experienced began
killing me once the war stopped. The
only way I could keep my mind intact
was to tear those wounds open each
time they started to heal. Has it
helped? Am I sane because of it? I
don't know.) <<<<<
-Colonel Cobra (03:20:18/01-05-55)
INTERPERSONAL SKILLS
Don't deceive yourself. You
can't be a successful mercenary by
"letting your gun speak for you."
That cliché will get you killed. You
are a professional, and you must
always behave like one.
As a professional soldier you
must know how to communicate,
how to send and receive messages.
Communication takes many forms,
and written and oral language represents only a minor area of true
communication. Simply by stating "I
am a mercenary," you are sending a
message. The base level of that particular message, however, has little
or nothing to do with you. What
that message communicates relies
almost completely on the receiving
person's perception of a mercenary's role. If they believe that mercenaries are soulless
killers, then they will deal with you on that basis. If they
believe that a mercenary is a professional who knows his
job and is prepared to do it, then your statement communicates that notion to them. Initially, it does not matter
what message you intend to send. What they believe
defines their interpretation of the message they receive.
If they perceive something different from what you
intend, you must convince them otherwise.
>>>>>(Many people live in a vacuum of understanding.
They view the world through their own frame of reference,
refusing to accept what other people hear or see as valid.
They don't realize that much of what each of us knows (or
believes we know) clouds our perceptions. Think about the
many tragedies that could have been avoided if people
paid attention to the messages they were sending and how
others perceived those messages.) <<<<<
-Doc Tanner (20:14:27/01-09-55)
You can only convince people of
what you really represent through
skilled communication. You tell
everyone you meet who and what
you are in four ways: the ways you
speak, write, act, and look.
Don't dismiss this as nonessential. I cannot exaggerate the importance of communication skills to a professional soldier. You must constantly
be aware of how others perceive you,
because their perceptions control their
behavior toward you. What you actually intend means nothing in the face
of what they believe of you.
How to Speak
Speak well, speak clearly. Make
sure they understand you. When on
duty, make every verbal communication with your superiors a formal
communication. This holds true
whether your superiors are your
friends or you think they are dog
scum. You are a professional.
Learn to speak the local language from a native. If you learn it
from a chip or rely on a linguasoft,
the natives will get the message that
you don't care enough to learn the
language properly. If you speak the
local language unassisted by technology, you send the message that you
are willing to spend the necessary
time to learn about the local culture.
You are willing to spend the time to learn how to speak
to them. That's a powerful message.
Learn how the locals speak. Do they speak loudly?
Softly? Using direct eye contact? Emulate the locals rather
than mimicking them, and don't attempt to do it perfectly. You probably can't, and it's better to acknowledge the
fact that you are an outsider who respects their culture
than to embarrass yourself and them by performing badly.
If you mess up, you appear to mock their traditions.
>>>>>(Day-to-day corporate life teaches the same lesson
with regard to the Japanese megacorps. How long has the
West maintained corporate relations with the Japanese? A
century? How many billions of nuyen have the corps spent
on research, analysis, and training? Can a gaijin bow correctly yet? Nope, yet they keep right on trying.) <<<<<
-Mr. Yota-san (20:19:27/01-10-55)
Do not speak to the locals as if they are subordinates.
These people live where you work. You are their guest,
even if you work for their government.
Your profession means that people will listen very
carefully to what you say to find the message they
expect. Because you are a mercenary, others will believe
you deceptive, hiding things behind doublespeak. Be
clear. Be concise. Allow no room for doubt or misunderstanding.
How to Write
Write clearly and concisely. Make sure they understand you. To tell the truth, I do little writing in the field.
Between jobs, however, I can easily fill my time with
after-action reports, supply and inventory requests, mission-planning documents, and so on. And though I may
not actually write the first draft (I prefer speech-recognition dictation into my pocket secretary) I always proof the
final document to make sure that it is complete and looks
professional, and that it doesn't sound like I wrote it offthe-cuff. Even the most well-structured, formal speech
reads poorly when written unless you edit it.
Learn to write the local language. In this case, chipbased literacy is usually good enough because written
language tends to be more formal. Languages based on
pictographic character sets constitute an exception to this
rule. Because even the most advanced linguasoft often
provides somewhat rough pictograph depiction, have a
trustworthy native proficient in the written language
check the lettering. Everyone who reads your communications will attempt to read between the lines, and will
look long and hard to find whatever they think you are
not telling them. Your only useful response is to leave
nothing to interpretation. Be clear. Be concise.
Avoid written communication whenever possible.
Even my mind boggles at the number of times I've heard
that operational security was compromised because
someone wrote down sensitive information. If you must
keep notes or, God forbid, a diary (I can think of few
actions more idiotic for a merc), write in a personal symbolic code. Don't use a cipher-ciphers can be easily broken. A code in which a single symbol sub-references an
entire concept and augments the following symbols is
much harder to break. Your opponent will need you to
translate such a code-and don't be naive; they'll make
you do it.
How to Act
The way you act may be your most important
method of communication. I have known many talented
men and women who think that holding a position of
power or carrying a gun gives them the right to act like
children. In fact, just the opposite is true.
>>>>>(Working the streets proves the ugly truth of what
Matador says here. I've been at countless meets where
the participants were copping the juvenile "wiz 'tude"
one-upmanship program. If I have to watch one more
street sam clean his blades during a negotiation, I'll
vomit. What's the point, other than pure narcissism? (And
I apologize to all you street sams who will have to look
that word up.)) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (04:24:28/01-06-55)
>>>>>(Hey Hatchet, I thought you were a street sam?) <<<<<
-Global Warmer (23:29:18/01-06-55)
>>>>>(I am. Trust me-I know all about them.) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (20:10:16/01-08-55)
The cliche is old but true: with power comes responsibility. I've said it at least a dozen times already: you are
a professional. You must act like a professional at all
times. How you act reflects on you, your allies, and others
in your profession.
Your actions send the most powerful messages about
who and what you are. Even a person who believes you a
soulless killer may change her mind over time when presented with behavior that refutes that belief.
I cannot create a comprehensive list of acceptable
and unacceptable actions, but I can offer some guidelines
based on my own experience. Fully exploring each of the
following guidelines could require an entire book per
guideline, but until I write those books, I can only hope
that the short explanations and examples will spark a little
understanding.
. Avoid non-professional relationships while on the
job. This short sentence covers a great many things. Don't
become friends with your client-keep that relationship
clearly defined. Develop a trusting, familiar, business relationship with your team members or allies, but don't
befriend them. (Save that for downtime. You can act
buddy-buddy, but do not develop an emotional attachment during the operation. What bonds people under
stress is different from what bonds people during the
calm. I find that friendships developed during the calm
are far stronger.) Avoid sexual relationships of any kind;
they only increase your vulnerability to blackmail or
manipulation. Sexual relationships can also lead to emotional bonds that could jeopardize the operation.
>>>>>(I don't know about this one. Ya see, Matador has
spent a lot of time isolating himself from emotional associations that could harm him. Despite this, he has an amazing ability to sympathize and empathize with all types of
people. I've seen it happen. What he does, though, is
abstracts it. He sympathizes with the situation. He
empathizes with the plight. He sees the problem as it
affects many people, not just one person. One person
could hurt him.) <<<<<
-Winter Rat (19:02:17/01-09-55)
. Play it straight. Because you are ultimately only a hired
hand, your best option is to shoot straight. For as long as
the operation lasts, your only loyalty is to your client. This
stays true unless you learn something you didn't know
when you began the operation that violates your personal
code. Even in that situation, play it straight. Protect yourself,
but lay your cards on the table.
>>>>>(Are you fraggers paying attention? THIS IS IMPORTANT ON THE STREETS. You know the saying, "It ain't a
shadowrun unless your Johnson has screwed you twice?"
You know why that's true? 'Cause the Johnsons think
shadowrunners are scum, and rightly so. Merc employers
don't have this attitude, and neither do people who hire
other kinds of freelancers. Why does this attitude stick to
shadowrunners? 'Cause these people are fools! They
heap crap on the Johnson. They act barely professional.
They don't make plans, or even think things through. They
create nearly as much trouble on the run as the run was
supposed to solve, and they have no respect for each
other or the people paying them. They aren't professionals in any sense of the word. They're thugs.) <<<<<

>>>>>(Fraggin' right I am, and I'm full-throttle tired of it. I
kicked the drek out of a decker two days ago because
he skimmed a corporate datastore we were explicitly told
not to skim. What's his excuse? "They're a corp; who's
gonna know?“ How about me? How about him? How
about our employer, since they know exactly when we
were in there? How about the corp we ran against that
just might be willing to absorb the damage? If the decker
skimmed something damn valuable and the corp finds
out, who'll be twisting in the wind then?) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (18:28:20/01-11-55)

-Findler-man (19:19:18/01-12-55)
· Play it smart. Know when to say no. Don't allow yourself to be drawn into positions detrimental to your health or
security just because it seems to be part of the game. Don't
allow yourself to be goaded into acting stupidly. Your
opposition (and perhaps someone on your own side) is
waiting for you to make a mistake. Stay in control. Don't
allow yourself to be manipulated or jerked around.
· Be a professional. Everything I talk about in this
book, everything, should become an integral, reflexive
part of your life. None of the advice written here can be
ignored even for a moment. Your life may depend on it.
More than once I've been in a bad situation, on the losing
side, but I walked away in one piece because I maintained
my professionalism. People respect that, even if they
don't respect what you do. I'll discuss another big part of
this particular point later on: odds are, you'll be facing
other professionals, other mercs. Respect runs both ways.
>>>>>(True, true, especially in the merc's field of operations. I've watched a merc field commander calmly eating lunch with his captured merc adversary with a complete lack of special security precautions or even a hint
of worry, simply because they're both merc. Boggled my
mind at first, but then I realized it's all part of this code
thing. Warfare is hell, and they're the ones who do it for
the ones who won't. All this code stuff is just one way of
keeping themselves sane.) <<<<<
-Merc-On-Training Wheels (20:42:59/01-09-55)
How to Dress
Don't stop reading now. You may think that discussing a merc's outfit sounds pretty dumb, but how you
dress sends a specific message. People base their
responses to you on what they think they know (preconceptions) and what they experience (perceptions). If I see
a merc on dress duty looking rumpled, I question his
commitment. If I see an off-duty merc out carousing and
looking like gutter filth, I question his discretion. If I see a
merc walk into the local watering-hole-cum-oppositionhangout in full-dress khakis, I question his sanity.
>>>>>(Oh, yeah. Remember that street sam I mentioned
before who was cleaning his blades while we negotiated
with a Johnson? Did I mention he had the top of his head
shaved, and what little hair remained was down to his
shoulder blades and bone white? Did I also mention that
he had tattooed on his bald head the words BITE MY
SNAKE? During the whole meeting, I could see the
Johnson looking this guy over and wondering just what
kind of people he was hiring.) <<<<<

>>>>>(Yeah, a red-and-brown anaconda named
Freddi.) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (18:34:58/01-11-55)
In general, ask yourself how another person would
react listening to you, conversing with you, or just watching you. Does everything about you send the message
that you are smart, alert, serious, skilled, perhaps dangerous, and definitely a professional? When you send that
message, you'll be surprised by how much easier your
job gets.
PREPAREDNESS
Never take a job blind. Before you agree to the terms
of a contract, do your own research, learn everything you
can. Check with your contacts. Listen to the people you
trust. Scan the media, but pay attention to who is saying
what. Everyone, everyone, speaks from a bias or private
agenda of some sort. If you recognize that bias or agenda,
you can use it to your advantage.
>>>>>(Yeah-if the government-run radio station isn't
shouting the news about how well its troops are doing in
the mountains hunting down the rebels. . . ) <<<<<
-Media Watcher II (21:58:09/01-11-55)
Take nothing for granted. As part of the contract, your
client may offer to provide you with everything you need.
Thank him graciously, but let him know in the most professional way possible that you prefer to make all arrangements yourself. If he is a professional, he'll understand.
Learn everything you can about your target zone,
your area of operations. Use maps, pictures, trideo, firsthand accounts, everything available. Absorb it, file it,
database it: you'll need it. Research other operations performed in the area. Why did they succeed or fail? What
were their strengths and weaknesses?
>>>>>(Personally, I know I'm in trouble when the team
I'm leading has a planning meeting and the response to
my suggestion that we track down and debrief other runners who've pulled a run against our target is a table full
of vapid stares. Then some wit says: "We can do
that?") <<<<<
-Hatchetman (04:20:18/01-12-55)
Consider the "why" as well as the "where." Never
enter a situation ignorant of local politics. That's the
fastest way to get yourself dead. Why is your employer
mounting this operation? What short- and long-term
results does he expect? Who profits from a successful
operation? Who gets hurt? Analyze all the players
involved, and learn their strengths and weaknesses.
Study a breakdown of your timetable. You can often
determine important information from the time that
things occur. For example, does your employer expect
you to wrap up the operation before spring? Why? Keep
a careful eye on weather and climate projections. It's an
amateur's mistake to be caught flat-footed by the weather, but it's amazingly easy to overlook that factor.
Finally, plan every step of the operation in detail.
Consider what you need in terms of manpower, equipment, and transportation. Arrange as many of these elements as possible yourself. Rely on your own contacts
and resources in order to reduce the chance of "unexpected exposure." Again, if your client is a professional,
he'll understand your methods. If forced to work with
local resources, inspect those resources personally as
early in the operation as possible. Don't trust your life to
other people's skill with machinery or inventory. Trust
only your own abilities.
Much of this advice assumes that you are in a position of authority. Even if you are not, learn these lessons
well. If you take this advice to heart, you can more easily
educate yourself about the wasp's nest you may land in.
Preparation is the best defense against any situation.
ORIENTATION AND EXPOSURE
Control your orientation and exposure by making your
own travel arrangements. Simple, but important.
Naturally, you need to inform your client of when and
where you will meet, but you need to establish certain
responsibilities early in the relationship. The employer
hires you to perform a specific function; in order to effectively perform all roles appropriate to that function, you
must control your own security as much as possible.
Because self-sufficiency is part of a merc's professionalism,
your client should understand. Thank him graciously and
use your own travel agent.
Your security work really begins when you reach your
area of operations. Be aware of everything around you, all
the time. Regardless of your location or your assignment,
you were hired to do something that poses a threat to
someone. Smart opponents will try to derail your operation before it begins. In the field you are always vulnerable, and you must devote constant effort to minimizing
your exposure.
>>>>>(And you know, the corps never have their ears to
the ground listening for a buncha steel-toed shadowrunners tromping through the urban jungle, conducting legwork like they were on safari.) <<<<<
-Jet Jaguar (20:51:38/01-12-55)
>>>>>(Geez, Jet, you sitting on the other end of the stick
that's up Hatchetman's butt?) <<<<<
-Found Finster! (13:28:29/01-13-55)
In merc terms, exposure refers to your vulnerability,
both personally and in terms of the operation. Security is
paramount. You must keep your operation secure at all
times, beginning long before you reach the operational
zone.
Never advertise your presence. When you reconnoiter
your operational area to gather information, never reveal
your identity or purpose. Though sometimes displays are
important, even a primary goal, most times you need to
have the lowest possible profile. Your team members
should rely on each other and no one else. You serve as
each other's safety net. Never forget that fact.
Discuss your operation only with those people directly cleared by your client. Even if you suspect, by virtue of
chain of command or relationship, that a person knows
the details of your operation, keep your own counsel.
Make every effort to avoid discussing the operation outside of a secure site. Because those who use electronic
and magical eavesdropping techniques have reached new
heights of subtlety and sophistication, you are automatically vulnerable anywhere outside your secure zone.
Create a secure zone. Your client may provide one for
you as part of your contract, but you must take steps to
ensure that it truly is secure. Supplement existing physical, electronic, and magical security with your own.
Again, if your client is a professional, he'll understand the
importance of this step to prevent problems and unwanted situations down the line.
Maintain weapon security. Operatives needlessly
jeopardize countless operations by failing to maintain
weapon security. Transport your weapons secretly and
securely. Don't risk exposure by allowing a local to spot a
concealed weapon. If you need to carry one for personal
safety, be smart and discreet. Don't display your weapon,
and don't use it as a badge of honor-it's not. It's a
weapon. It kills people. Never forget what it is and why
you carry it.
Once you are secure in your zone of operation,
update your research. Use local resources to see if anything has changed since your initial research. For example, always check the terrain. Never assume that your
map is accurate. Things change quickly in this day and
age. Conduct reconnaissance, review your existing intelligence, update your plans, modify your procedures. Stay
on top of the situation. You are in the zone; what was
once paperwork and projections is now real. Your life is
on the line.
>>>>>(Many mercs (and others) forget that situations are
dynamic. Engrossed in their own plans, they forget that the
opposition can and does react to events by taking action.
The situation will change. The operative must forecast the
change and move before it.) <<<<<
-Jade Horseman (17:25:06/11-12-55)
TYPES OF WORK
Mercs perform three main types of work: corp work,
government work, and independent (indi) work. All merc
operations share common elements, but significant differences distinguish these three types of work. The following
descriptions provide an overview of common mercenary
working conditions.
Corporate Work
Corporate work has become the mercenary's most
reliable source of potential income, though available government work appears to be on an upswing, possibly in
response to corp work. Corps most often hire mercs to
supplement existing corp forces, either security or military. The most common assignment is simple site security, protecting a large or small facility. The area of operation is usually an unstable region that makes the corp nervous about the safety of its installation. Corps rarely create site-security assignments in a country or a major
urban center administered by a stable government, preferring to devote their security resources to areas of
unstable government or intense corporate competition.
Corporate work usually places mercs within the corporation's chain of command, where they must follow orders
rather than giving them. Corporations often require their
hired soldiers to do dirty work. If such work violates your
personal code, stay away from corp assignments.
>>>>>(I've done a lot of these ops. You could say it's my
forte. (I might say it too if I knew what the word meant.)
Usually, the corp is expecting trouble, and so initially
deploys you to some off-site location. They keep you
there in a state of high readiness, and then sneak you onsite. If the opposition isn't paying attention (and they're
usually too busy getting their own operation in motion to
discover yours), they're caught by surprise. It works more
often than you'd guess. Personally, I'd have laid bets that
the opposition would be watching the site morning,
noon, and night in every situation.) <<<<<
-Leaguer (12:09:28/01-13-55)
>>>>>(You'd be amazed.) <<<<<
-Hatchetman (21:29:17/01-16-55)
Corps rarely use mercs for internal security. Most
often, mercenaries perform outside security at sites far
removed from principal corporate enclaves.
Mercs supplementing corporate military forces usually work in hot spots. The corps don't hire mercs unless
they expect trouble, and serious trouble only crops up in
unstable regions. To the best of my knowledge, however,
the corps don't recruit mercs for Desert Wars. If they do it
at all, they do it quietly and hope the opposing corps and
the networks don't find out.
Corps sometimes hire mercs for "face-offs," when two
or more corps settle their differences by force of arms.
This type of assignment sometimes takes the form of nonlethal, tag-gun combat, but sometimes it's high-pay hazard/lethal work.
>>>>>(Corporate military actions offer no joy. Corp
forces are too well equipped. You can't protect yourself
against half these weapons, and protection against the
other half relies on some piece of barely substantial
microtronic hardware. Really builds the old confidence,
let me tell you.) <<<<<
.
-Worm Heart (22:39:27/01-14-55)
Government and Related Work
Mercs find government work easy to come by, and
this work often provides long-term contracts.
Governments, especially those of less prosperous and less
stable nations, like to use mercs because mercenaries provide and manage their own assets.
Most contracts include a replacement or reimbursement clause,
which most governments find a
more efficient and economical alternative than owning and maintaining
the equipment themselves.
>>>>>(This is certainly the case for
sophisticated electronics and such.
For example, most developing
countries contract at least half their
air assets, usually more than half.
Many also contract for radar and
surveillance assets, as well as
defensive surface-to-air systems
and the like. Much more economical, at least until the systems need
repair. And even then, most combat units assume partial liability for
damage or loss.) <<<<<
-Sten (21:10:14/01-11-55)
Government merc work tends
to be high-mortality, however,
because it relies heavily on garrison
and area control duty in unstable
regions, suppressing rebellions, and
countering guerrilla warfare. Mercs
performing government work must
deal with high exposure: you move
often and quickly, you rarely have time to secure a location, and the locals may act against you. Because these
jobs offer the highest pay scale, that single advantage
regularly outweighs the disadvantages. You takes the
money and takes your chances.
Mercs may also receive offers of anti-government
work, which pits them against mercs doing government
work. Anti-government jobs tend to offer low pay and
many dangers, but these types of assignments attract the
altruistic mercs who can still believe in a cause. Though I
have stated that I only take jobs I believe in, altruism is
not part of my personal code. Altruism can blind you. A
merc needs a pragmatic intellect to out-argue his emotions. If yours does not, I wish you well.
Indi Work
All the operations I've described so far offer opportunities to all-merc teams through established channels. A
mercenary can also find work through independent channels. In plain English, I'm talking about so-called "shadowrunning" opportunities.
>>>>>(Yeah, all-merc teams-you
know, buncha guys dressed like
leaves sitting around in the woods
coppin' a 'tude.) <<<<<
-Wag (09:20:18/01-14-55)
A shadowrun puts a merc into a
familiar yet different environment.
In this kind of job, you become part
of a multi-function team created to
achieve some short-term goal. The
task will require you to use all your
skills in heavy exposure. You enter
the operation as an individual rather
than as part of an established team,
though you may ultimately negotiate the terms of your contract as an
individual or as part of the temporary group.
For nearly every shadowrun, you
will have the best tactical skills in
the group. You are there to offer the
benefits of those skills. Everyone in
the group has a niche, a specific
role to play. Demand and maintain
control of your area of expertise.
>>>>>(Hey, I always thought we
hired the merc because he had
the light machine gun?) <<<<<
-Vambrace (21:29:14/01-15-55)
>>>>>(Shhhh, don't let him hear you ... ) <<<<<
-Wedge (21:39:09/01-16-55)
One word of warning: indi employers (clients in the
"shadowrunning" end of the business) generally hold
poor opinions of shadowrunners. Why? Because shadowrunners rarely act like professionals, in our sense of the
term. They have no personal discipline, no code, no
sense of honor or trust, and no discretion. If you work as
part of a "shadowrunning" team, it becomes more important than ever that you remain alert, smart, and professional. Someone has to.
>>>>>(See! What did I tell you!) <<<<<

TYPES OF OPERATIONS
Everything you've read so far has explained what a
mercenary should know about himself, his operation, and
his opposition. This next section describes the standard
types of merc operations. Each type involves unique
peculiarities and concerns, and each could form the basis
of an entire book. The best I can do with my limited space
is to provide some food for thought.
In my opinion, the Desert Wars represent an insult to
everything I hold true about my profession and cannot be
included in a discussion of war in any sense.
>>>>>(Go Guards!) <<<<<
-Toiler (20:18:27/01-12-55)
>>>>>(Honestly, do you have any idea how many Desert
War participants use some variation of the name
"Guards" ?! ) <<<<<
-Houda (14:17:16/01-14-55)
OPEN WARFARE
The flat-out fight commonly seen in war trids and other
such forms of entertainment represents the least common
assignment a mercenary is likely to pick up these days,
simply because no one is currently fighting the kind of wars
in which standard armies clash with each other. That kind of
war just doesn't happen any more. Occasional skirmishes
take place between company-size units (100 men), but
these rarely expand beyond border clashes or brushfire
wars that flare up quickly and die just as quickly. The days
of large-scale military clashes are past. Modern-day conflicts tend to take place between warlords, provinces, and
relatively small forces. The Euro-Wars marked the end of
true "warfare" in the classical sense.
>>>>>(What about the secession of Tir Tairngire from
NAN? The way I read it certainly sounded like warfare in
the sense he's talking about.) <<<<<
-Loodles (13:27:45/01-14-55)
>>>>>(Not the secession itself, but perhaps the Battle of
Redding. That incident, of course, resulted from Tir
forces entering northern California and engaging dugin California National Guard units near Redding. Official
versions of that engagement state that the Tir entered
California with the equivalent of an armored division.
That number might be exaggerated a bit, but no
records try to dispute that the Tir mounted an extensive
force. The short duration of the engagement makes it
one of Matador's brushfire wars rather than open warfare. I should also point out that the Euro-Wars were still
in progress when this skirmish played out, which further
reinforces Matador's statement.) <<<<<
-Colonel Cobra (11:10:15/11-15-55)
Will we see open warfare anytime soon? Not likely. If
any such action does occur, ten to one it will involve
Aztlan and the Confederated American States, a couple of
the Russian satellites, or a few of the mid-African regimes.
Multitudes of books explain in mind-numbing detail
how to fight a modern war. I see no point in retreading them
here. If you have any interest in this field, you already know
these books. I strongly recommend that you restrict your
reading list to works published in this century and earlier by
the following strategists: Sun Tzu, Clausewitz, Napoleon,
Rommel, and Dunnigan. These works can provide insights
that the current generation of modern electronic battlefield
mavens could never hope to understand. No matter how
expensive the gadgets, the basics remain the same.
GUERRILLA WARFARE
Guerrilla warfare currently best represents the realities
of modern war. Small force versus large force. Rebel versus oppressor. Minority versus majority. Mercs usually
find work on the side of the "majority," except in cases of
externally financed insurrection, because the larger force
usually has more resources. The smaller opposition, or the
minority, usually lacks training but makes up for it in dedication and inspiration. Because they believe they have
"right" on their side, the minority opponent is always
dangerous.
I commented earlier in this book that anyone can fire
a submachine gun into a crowd. The minority force represents the anyones. The farmers, the merchants, the men,
the women, and even the children believe in their cause
and will die for it. They might take you with them, if
you're not careful.
Whether you believe in the side you're on is between
you and your conscience. But it is important to realize
that in such a conflict, both sides may be right. Always
remember that conflicts rarely arise from simple issues. If
people feel strongly enough to fight, the issue is important to them. Never dismiss your opponent's beliefs,
because those beliefs are as valid as yours.
Guerrilla warfare is difficult. You fight an opponent who
knows the terrain far better than you do, a motivated
opponent who doesn't want you there. In guerrilla warfare,
anything goes. Such fighting is never a gentlemen's war.
No matter what happens, no matter what they do, no
matter how hard they push, you must never stoop to the
opposition's level. Adhere to your rules of engagement.
Abide by the original Geneva Conventions and the 2042
Munich Amendments. Fight honorably. Let them worry
about sleeping at night.
>>>>>(Easy for you to say. People who hurt my people
pay. That's my code.) <<<<<
-Stoneface Jackson (23:20:07/01-14-55)
>>>>>(Actually, it probably wasn't easy for him to
say.) <<<<<
-Winter Rat (04:56:35/01-15-55)
Opponents in guerrilla warfare constantly try to force
the other side to make mistakes, especially to harm civilians. If you feel any doubt about a civilian's guilt, err on the
side of mercy. Do not attack a target that might include
innocents. This stand gets tough, because the opposition
tends to hide among the civilian population and dare you
to strike. Don't take the dare; instead, make your own
opportunities for battle. Be proactive in your stance and
tactics. Force your opponents into the open. Force them
into action by targeting the opposition leaders.
I can see your scowls already. You think that what I'm
suggesting violates my code, the part that objects to
assassination. Well, what of it?
Quite simply, I do not view a leader who chooses to
hide his forces among the innocent as worth my compassion. He hides his soldiers among the local population
assuming that his opponent will come after them and
civilians will die. If such a leader really cared for his people, he would do everything in his power to protect
them. Any other attitude demonstrates the workings of
an evil mind. I suffer no compunction about assassinating
such soulless men.
Assassinations and guerrilla warfare in general
become more difficult to conduct against a truly partisan
opponent, when your opponent is the civilian. History
shows us that all conflicts fought against motivated civilians result in long, bloody struggles. Any time I see a
conflict against civilians shaping up, I walk. No military
solution exists in such situations, short of unrestricted
warfare and genocide, and I will not participate in that
kind of warfare.
>>>>>(You moral snob. That's right, pick and choose your
fights. Only get involved in the clean fights, lest we dirty
our khakis. Your pretentiousness and hypocrisy make me
sick.) <<<<<

>>>>>(Don't lose it on your keyboard. Half-digested soyfood and bile is a bear to clean out from between the
keys.) <<<<<
-Mugger Hugger (10:28:27/01-16-55)
DISPLAYS
Displays provide a show of power to potential opposition. Your employers assume that your capable-looking
presence at a location or function will deter any possible
trouble. I believe that most displays fall into one of two
categories: dress displays and field displays.
Dress displays are like Halloween. You dress up and
play soldier. Your employer asks you to act as a "military
advisor" for the evening at some military or quasi-military
function that his adversaries will also attend. You talk a
good game and convince your client's enemies that he,
you, and "hundreds" like you mean business.
An employer might also ask you to appear in force
and parade around. Some mercs love this kind of service,
others hate it. If I can save a dozen lives by putting on my
dress braids, it's a worthwhile effort. Other times, the
same situation makes me feel like a puppet.
In a field display, a merc goes out in the field and
gets noticed. Air-based mercenary units (chopper or
fighter mercs) like this type of assignment especially well
because they get paid simply for doing flybys and
buzzing the crowd.
Unfortunately, a field display may quickly and unexpectedly become a skirmish. The warlord you've been
hired to impress may decide to start shooting. If you take
on a field display, include response and defense clauses
in your contract, and a provision to re-negotiate if the situation changes. Always be ready to respond to a dynamic situation.
BUG HUNTS/"THE BIG GAME"
I include this employment opportunity simply
because it has become a lucrative field for the single
operator. This type of "assignment" places mercs as assistants to professional and not-so-professional hunters on
animal-hunting excursions. You provide tactical advice
and skilled, heavy weapon back-up should the client
(usually a corp exec) fail to "bag the big one" before the
"big one" tries to bag him.
Another phenomenon that attracts many mercs is
"The Big Game," simsense producer Brilliant Genesis'
game show/contest/ratings grabber. As you might
expect, in this production famous (and not-so-famous)
big-game hunters and mercs hunt big game, in this case
defined as paranormal creatures. The show awards points
for bagging different kinds of critters (no sentients accepted), with the scale sliding higher or lower depending on
how dangerous the creature is and the weapons used to
kill it. For example, killing a creature using an assault cannon when an assault rifle would have sufficed is worth
fewer points, and using your fists when a rocket launcher
is the standard weapon of choice is worth more.
Strange stuff. I don't endorse it or dismiss it, merely relate it.
>>>>>(Bagged me a pair of banshees (the elfie/howling
kind). That'll knock my points way up there!) <<<<<
-Henry Hunter (21:08:29/11-14-55)
SECURITY
Security work can be fairly straightforward or may
offer unpleasant complications. Because you work under a
corporate overseer, the corp decides on tactics and procedures. How well the operation comes off depends on
the competence of the corporate coordinator.
Though this subject deserves a full-length treatment,
suffice it to say that corporate security work can be one of
the safest types of assignments because inter-corporate
conflicts rarely involve out-and-out destruction of assets. A
merc working security might get hurt, but if your opponent is playing by the same rules, he's not shooting to kill.
PERSONAL SERVICE
Mercs who take personal service work usually serve
several loosely defined functions; bodyguard, advisor,
and dress display. A merc hired to perform personal service may become the client's confidant, co-conspirator,
protection, threat display, and potential scapegoat. This
difficult job tends to place you at the center of the maelstrom. You stand at the heart of a situation, at the focal
point of all the machinations and passions, and closest to
the truth. This perspective allows you to quickly determine the things that may not be as they seemed, and
allows you to walk away early if necessary.
A merc can pick up this kind of work from a client living in fear who needs a protective presence to reassure
him so that he can meet each new day. These people
often have a very good reason to be afraid. Once you
determine that reason, you must decide whether or not
you want to continue working for this individual. Your
decision marks who you are and what kind of work you
will accept. Make your decisions carefully.
As you establish a reputation based on these decisions, you may develop long-lasting relationships with
people who are or become important. In these cases, you
may assume that you know the truth going in, or at least
the truth as understood by the client. These leaders may
come to rely on you to occasionally lend your expertise in
more than one situation.
>>>>>(But be careful. Petty dictators find it easy to assign
blame for failures to others. And you may be one of your
client's few advisors that isn't a blood relative.) <<<<<
-Jooom (24:06:42/01-16-55)
As you gain experience and further your reputation,
you may receive the opportunity to ascend almost to the
top of the merc ladder and serve as an advisor.
ADVISORS
The most favorable position a merc can accept is that
of an advisor. Your employers bring you in as a consulting
expert in the military field, and so respect your opinion
and listen to your advice. If your reports and their desires
coincide, they may place you in a position of great power
from which you command troops and recruit others farther down the professional mercenary ladder.
>>>>>(You make arrangements for the client, essentially
becoming his fixer by using your fixer/dealer to get
what's needed. A nice position to be in.) <<<<<
-Sten (18:28:14/01-16-55)
The lure of such power and influence may tempt you
to tell your client what he or she wants to hear, regardless
of the truth of the situation. By doing so, you virtually
guarantee yourself continued employment.
Don't do it.
Always play it straight. If your research and expertise
tells you one thing, don't tell the client something different. Give him the hard news. He may not thank you for it,
but unless you are working in some dark corner of the
planet devoid of all trappings of civilization, the days of
killing the messenger are long gone. You might lose your
job because you told him something he didn't want to
hear, but when the drek hits the turbofan later down the
road, someone might remember your evaluation and
warning. Next time, they just might listen. And if that
client won't, someone else may.
Most advisors receive excellent pay, topnotch support and accommodations, and mind-blowing perks. Don't
allow yourself to be seduced. It's easy to fall victim to the
luxury and forget why you are there, but remember that
other people will pay most dearly for your mistakes. If the
policies you recommend fail, you might lose your job, but
the dog soldiers in the field will pay the ultimate price.
SPECIAL OPERATIONS
Special ops, the black stuff, are performed by small
units for high pay under very dangerous conditions. Killer
work (so to speak) if you can get it, and the best of the
best often do. Corps, governments, and many independent outfits run special ops, and mercs reap the benefits.
It's difficult to know how many special ops are being run
these days, because pros rarely talk about their work.
There's no profit in bragging. The people who need to
know what you've done in order to recommend you for
another job always find out. You don't have to tell them.
>>>>>(Braggers tend to be floaters.) <<<<<
-Sanction (08:02:30/01-17-55)
Special ops covers an almost limitless range of assignments. You name it, and someone's probably been paid to
do it. Extractions, kidnappings, hit-and-runs, search-anddestroys, anti-asset raids, harassment raids, infiltration and
sabotage, commando work-all these and more fall under
special operations.
Today, most special ops fall under the unfortunate
heading of shadowrunning. If you want that work, you've
got to work the streets. Some mercs refuse these offers,
but most consider the work too lucrative to pass up.
Mercs will find, however, that their expertise is underappreciated in the shadowrunning market. Runners universally consider the merc nothing more than the guy with
the big gun. You've got to teach them otherwise. Show
them why they need a true professional in their midst.
>>>>>(I always insist on a professional in our midst,
especially after a good fight. A professional masseuse,
that is.) <<<<<

-Sheila Sunrise (08:20:16/01-18-55)
ORGANIZATIONS
The number of mercenary organizations has risen in
the last twenty-odd years. Germany's MET 2000 group
and associated assets represent the top tier. They sign
mercs like you and me to long-term contracts, train them
into units, then assign the units to contracts with clients.
It's a sweet deal for a merc. You cut through all the planning and asset-managing to the job at hand and still get
well paid. Not bad, eh?
The down side of belonging to a merc organization
like MET 2000 is that such organizations make it extremely difficult to leave their ranks. You are working on the
company's terms, living with a corporate rather than a
personal code, and can no longer walk away if the situation changes for the worse. You are not in control-you
are a company man. MET 2000 does not allow its
employees to bail out of a contract, and the organization
has an arm long enough to reach those who do.
>>>>>(Matador, you goronit, you hate MET 2000 because we
skinned your hide last year. Admit it!) <<<<<

>>>>>(If you believe that's what happened, you're even
more of a corporate toad than I thought.) <<<<<
-Matador (13:51:10/01-14-55)
Not every merc shares my point of view on this subject. In fact, a few thousand employees of MET 2000
would probably disagree with me. (By the way, don't
blindly accept any published MET 2000 membership
numbers. I have it on good authority that those numbers
are grossly inflated.) I respect the choice of those who
disagree with me. And for others who might find such
indentured servitude desirable, I provide a short list of the
better-known and financially respected international mercenary companies. Friends of mine have worked for these
companies with what they consider desirable results.

THE LEAGUE
The League is a phenomenon that I can only describe
as the international brotherhood of mercenaries. No formal organization, no meeting place, no dues, and no
newsletter for the League exist. In fact, nothing exists to
identify this group as a group. Yet all mercenaries are
members of the League simply by virtue of their profession as soldiers of fortune.
All members of the League should treat each other
with respect and fairness, as long as they deserve it. A
fool who jeopardizes himself and others through idiotic
posturing and ill-considered actions has lost his place in
the brotherhood, and deserves only contempt.
The tradition of fair treatment especially applies to
your opponent. Your opposite number took a job with the
other side for the same reason you agreed to work for
your side. Don't treat opposing mercenaries unfairly just

MAGICAL INTEGRATION
Magic is so prevalent these days that I don't bother
to make a distinction between standard and "mystical"
assets. My attitude, however, remains unique.
Corporations, especially, foolishly insist on grouping
paranatural assets together and thinking of them as separate from their security or military assets.
Mercenaries use magic in every situation where it
seems appropriate, but mostly to accomplish tasks as efficiently as possible. Magic is ideal for surveillance and
recon work because it enables you to pick up a lot of
information at low risk and low exposure. Magic also
offers many advantages in anti-espionage work, securing
your physical site, and protecting your own assets.
Magic has very little offensive value, simply because
too few mages are in the field to wage effective magical
warfare. Special ops regularly use mages to great effect,
but magic offers few advantages to other operations.
Employers sometimes attach a magician to a field ops unit,
but only if the field unit has a specific objective that can be
achieved most efficiently using magic. I personally know of
only one or two units that permanently include a magician.
>>>>>(Again, what about the Tir secession from NAN?
Seems like lots of combat magic went down
there!) <<<<<
-Loodles (13:39:40/01-14-55)
>>>>>(Read the battle reports again, Loodles. My read is
that the Tir used invisibility to conceal their forces. It was
2036; if the CNC weren't concerned enough about such
possibilities to guard against them, then they got what
was coming to them. On the other hand, I suspect that
all the tales of combat magic from those battles were
somewhat exaggerated.) <<<<<
-Colonel Cobra (11:46:04/11-15-55)
When a magician takes part in an operation, he should
be deployed as a special weapons team and sent where
needed. Currently, magicians primarily fill recon and defensive roles. I suspect those roles will someday change, but
most likely not until long after I leave the business.
HOT SPOTS
I've covered the why and how and who of being a
mercenary. The following list tells you where. The world
situation is too volatile for any list to be comprehensive,
but the places described below represent the current government/anti-government hot spots. For any other kind of
work, buy an atlas and mark all the megacities. Be sure to
say hello if you see me out there.
AZTLAN
Today, right now, Aztlan offers one of the biggest
markets for anti-government work in the merc biz. The
rebel forces enjoy generous financial backing, so Aztlan
work tends to pay well.
The Azzies are a brutal people and highly skilled at
war. They pride themselves on self-sufficiency, which
means they don't care for mercenaries and so treat them
poorly. Because the Aztlan problem is effectively a civil
war with external backers, both sides can draw from a
large pool of guerrilla warriors, but these enthusiastic soldiers lack training. Mercs act as trained leaders and advisors, making ripe targets for the opposition.
FAR EAST
Southeast Asia remains a mess. Since the Awakening,
virtually all political borders have disappeared. Only
Korea maintains any semblance of cohesion, and even
that nation seems fragile these days. Warlords dominate,
and mercs abound. The Far East is a dangerous, changing
environment controlled by leaders with no morals and
few concerns beyond their petty dictatorships. The pay is
good, but the risks are high.
AUSTRALIA
A decent amount of merc work exists in Australia,
mainly protecting supply caravans and enclaves against
local and preternatural forces. The pay is good, but the
wildness of the region, especially the rampant magic, is
not for the faint of heart.
AFRICA
Unfortunately, present-day Africa is a mecca for merc
work. Small nation-states or city-states and their warlords
employ countless mercs to sort out their internal
upheavals. As in Southeast Asia, the region brims over
with chaos and danger. But if you didn't thrive on those conditions, you'd have stopped reading this screed long ago.

THE END OF THE MERCENARY
The battlefield is changing. As I've pointed out, precious few people still fight all-out wars. Few nations or
corps have or are willing to spend the vast financial
resources needed for such a venture. As always, manpower
is cheap but the tools of warfare are not. Subterfuge, espionage, and counterespionage have replaced armies of
tanks as the tools for solving national problems.
This is good.
Sure, ultimately it means less work for me, but it also
means fewer threats to life and limb for everyone else. I'd
rather see the world's problems resolved with small skirmishes, police actions, and brushfire wars. Better that
than the alternative.
What does this mean for my profession? It means we
must adapt. I believe that future battles will be fought by
small units wielding incredibly sophisticated weapons
capable of focusing more firepower than you or I can
even imagine, and magic will also play an important part.
I foresee that the soldier of the future will be part mage,
part mercenary, and part metal.
Mercs like us won't be part of that battlefield.
We will still be part of the battlefield where the real
people fight. We'll be where people bleed, and hurt, and
fight for causes they believe in. We'll be standing next to
them, waiting for the charge.
Maybe I'll see you there.

Carl Walther PB-120
In the field, reliability means everything. The Walther PB-120 offers total reliability in a low-profile, easy-to-hide, back-up pistol. Constructed primarily of composite

In addition to the standard 10-shot clip, Walther also produces a 15-shot,

FRANCHI SPAS-22
The latest in a long line of renowned combat shotguns, the SPAS-22
meets the most stringent performance standards. Capable of selective fire in
both single-action and burst-fire modes, the SPAS-22 can hold its own at any
time, in any place. A custom folding stock* lets it close up small, making it an
ideal weapon for low-profile operations. The SPAS-22 comes with Smartlink
IITM hardware, making an already outstanding weapon top gun the world over.

M79B1 LIGHT ANTI ARMOR WEAPON
The M79B1 Light Anti-armor Weapon (LAW) is the most common weapon
of its type in the world. Designed as a disposable, telescoping container, the
single-shot LAW is self-contained and cannot accept accessories. Cheap but
reliable, the LAW enables its user to take on almost any armored vehicle!
Fired from a shoulder mount, the LAW vents launch gases through the
rear of the firing tube, virtually eliminating recoil. A simple, non-adjustable
aperture permits excellent sighting under standard environmental conditions.

GREAT DRAGON ATGM
Co-manufactured by Mitsubishi and General Motors Military Division, the
Great Dragon ATGM (anti-tank guided missile) is a ground-based spinoff of
GM's popular Bandit air-to-ground missiles. Fired from a tripod-mounted,
reusable canister, the Great Dragon ATGM has proven an effective battlefield
weapon. An integral, semi-smart tracking system keeps the launched missile
on target, and delayed main-engine ignition helps hide the launcher's location. These features, combined with a shaped-charge, armor-piercing warhead, enable the Great Dragon to stop enemy armor of any size.

BALLISTA MULTI-ROLE MISSILE LAUNCHER
Manufactured by Saeder-Krupp's infamous Special Munitions branch, the
sophisticated Ballista consists of a backpack mechanism that deploys a shoulder-firing missile tube. The Ballista missile can be used with the launcher
inclined as an indirect-fire weapon, or as a direct-fire weapon balanced on the
shoulder. The indirect-fire system revolves around microtronic compensators
that align the tube at the proper angle regardless of the firer's position with
respect to true vertical, and can fire Ballista Mk I or Mk II rounds. The directfire system operates similarly to other missile launchers and can fire Mk I, II,
and III Ballista missiles.

An extremely dependable weapon, the M-12 mortar is based on a battleproven design. Its long barrel ends in a four-pronged base that digs into and
anchors the weapon against the ground, and a swing-out, bipod brace props
the weapon at a firing angle. The weapon's operator enters firing angles and
environmental conditions manually into the controls of the barrel-mounted
sight. In addition to sighting and firing the weapon himself, the operator can
fire based on data from a spotter. The M-12 can fire "dumb" rounds or

GEL-PACK ARMOR
When you need something tougher than soft-cloth ballistic armor, step up
to real protection. Kelmar Tech's patented gel-pack technology provides hardened protection against penetration along with maximum comfort and flexibility. Kelmar gel-packs remain liquid and flexible until the shock wave of a projectile impact solidifies the gel into an impenetrable barrier. As the kinetic
energy dissipates, the gel liquefies, ready to absorb the next impact. Kelmar's
military-spec combat armor is the best of the best!
Mil-spec gel packs can be added to any available armor. With the addition of gelpacks, treat armor as Hardened at its normal Ballistic and Impact ratings. If applicable,
reduce Concealability by half (rounded down). The gel-packs increase all armor's
weight by 25 percent, multiply its cost by 5, double its Street Index and Availability
target number, and quadruple the time required to get it.
If a weapon's Power, before burst or autofire modifications, does not exceed the
modified armor's rating, the round does not penetrate and does no damage. If a
weapon's Power exceeds the armor's rating, reduce the rating per standard
Shadowrun rules. Penetration reduces the armor's rating by 1 per penetration.

Looking for a little more armor protection for your vehicle? European Arm

Designed to attach to the vehicle's exterior, ablative armor absorbs the kinetic

sudden death! Three different available levels let you choose the degree of
protection you need! Not usable on aircraft.

the armor level, reduce the increase in the Armor Rating by -1. It takes 6 hours to

RULES
This section offers combat rules expansions, clarifications, and options in
response to player and gamemaster questions and comments. An expanded
Weapon Range Table that provides ranges for all Shadowrun weapons published
to date, including the new weapons described in this book, appears at the end of
this section.
DEVELOPER NOTES
This sourcebook exposes and explains the shadowy realm of the mercenary. This sourcebook is not about playing a mercenary storyline, but about playing a mercenary character within
the Shadowrun storyline. In the former case, all the player characters are mercenaries and the
story objectives have purely mercenary origins and direction. In the latter, the mercenary player
character plays a specific part shaped by his unique experiences, viewpoint, and attitude.
Creative gamemasters may find enough information in this sourcebook to create a "mercs-only"
spin-off of Shadowrun, but this book was not designed with that outcome in mind. (Good luck,
though, to those who decide to go for it!)

This book also includes plenty of gear. Mercs like
toys as much as street samurai do, and this book presents a hefty cross-section of useful, fun equipment. As
one might expect, the classifications of merc toys and
street sam toys overlap pretty far. After all, it isn't really,
"He who dies with the most toys wins," but, "He who
uses his toys best wins." Some equipment described in
this book duplicates information and gear from previous
Shadowrun products, because feedback from
Shadowrun players and gamemasters indicated that the
public wanted more information about a specific item or
a game mechanic related to that item's use. To make life
easier for players and gamemasters, both existing and
new information has been grouped into one place.
With regard to the rules expansions, clarifications,
and combat options offered in this section, FASA sends
abject apologies to those who might have received conflicting adjudications to these rules questions some time
in the past.
CHOOSING OPTIONAL RULES
Consider all the rules clarifications, expansions, and
options in this sourcebook as optional suggestions for
play. As always, gamemasters and players should
review these rules before beginning play and agree on
which ones to use. The gamemaster and players are also
the final arbiters of how rules should be interpreted.
EXPANSIONS AND CLARIFICATIONS
The following expansions and clarifications refer to
the existing rules printed in Shadowrun, Second Edition
(1992). Page references for that book are provided
where necessary.
ARMOR DEGRADATION
For the sake of simplified bookkeeping, SRII ignored
the effects of armor degradation. The following rule
takes armor degradation into account.
A character who takes a Moderate wound or greater
damage from a non-Stun attack suffers armor damage.
The armor loses 1 point for every multiple of its appropriate value represented by the Power of the attack. For
example, a character wearing an armored jacket takes a
hit from a submachine gun burst with a Damage Code of
10S. The jacket has a Ballistic Rating of 5. If the character
takes at least Moderate damage, the attack permanently
reduces the rating of the armor by 2 points.
This rule also applies to Impact armor. Hardened
body or vehicle armor (but not critter armor) degrades at
the same rate.
ATHLETIC TESTS
The following rules apply to resolving Athletics
Tests, specifically for running, jumping, climbing, swimming and so on. Some of the material below first
appeared in SRII and other sources. In all instances,
Damage Modifiers (p. 112, SRII) apply.
Climbing
Characters normally perform one of two types of
climbing: unassisted and assisted. Unassisted climbing is
exactly what it sounds like-the character climbs on the
strength of his or her own ability. Assisted climbing
involves the use of climbing equipment.
Make the Climbing Test (requiring a Complex
Action) against a target number reflecting the difficulty
of the obstacle being climbed. The gamemaster determines the base target number by how easy the surface is
to climb (craggy, sheer, and so on), modified by the

Characters can normally climb upward a number of
meters each turn equal to one-quarter (25 percent) the
average of their Quickness and Strength (round down).
For each success from the Climbing Test, add 2 to the
average of Quickness and Strength for this calculation.
Climbing down is easier: characters can move down a
number of meters equal to twice the average of their
Quickness and Strength. (Characters can, of course, elect
to climb down really quickly. See Falling rules, p. 76.)
Assisted climbing makes the upward climb slower,
but allows the character to overcome the conditions listed in the Climbing Table. Assisted climbing requires the
use of climbing gear (see Field Pack, p. 56). When using
climbing gear, modify the base target number for the
Climbing Test by -10, making a Climbing Test once
every three minutes to reflect the time it takes to safely
position the climbing gear on the surface being climbed.
Assisted climbing down, known as rappelling, is a
lot faster. With the proper equipment, rappelling allows
characters to make a controlled descent at close to freefall speeds and introduces the handy ability to slow the
descent and land safely. A rappelling character falls at a
rate of 20 meters per Simple Action expended. Note
that only one of the two Simple Actions available in a
Combat Phase can be expended in this manner. Yes, this
means that a character can rappel and shoot in the same
Action Phase, but must add a +4 modifier to both the
Firearms Test and the Climbing Test.
Rappelling characters increase the number of meters
descended that Action Phase by 1 for each success from a
Climbing (4) Test. When the character reaches the bottom
(or his destination), he must make another Climbing (4)
Test. On an unsuccessful test, the character falls 4 meters
and takes appropriate damage. See Falling, below.
If the Rule of One applies during any Climbing Test, the
character plummets the full distance to the ground.
Benevolent gamemasters may allow the character to make a
Quickness (6) Test to grab something and prevent the fall.
Falling
All falls have a Damage Level of "D", with the Power
of the fall's "attack" being one-half the number of meters
fallen (round down). The character may use Body dice
for a Damage Resistance Test to reduce the damage.
Subtract one-half (round down) of the character's impact
armor rating from the Power of the fall. Characters may
also make an Athletics Test against a target number
equal to the full distance fallen (in meters). Each success
from this test also reduces the Power of the fall by 1.
A falling character has a "Falling Action" every 10
Combat Phases. At that time the character is considered to
have fallen a number of additional meters equal to 20
meters times the number of "Falling Actions" (including the
current one) spent in rapid descent. A falling character has
an Initiative of 30 for every turn until the character lands.
For those gamemasters counting in real-time,
remember that a falling body plummets at an acceleration rate of about 10 meters/per second/per second.
The falling character drops 10 meters in the first second,
20 more meters in the second, 30 more meters in the
third, and so on. The reason for the difference in the
falling rate values (20 in SRII rules and 10 in real life) is
that the SRII Combat Turn takes up an abstract amount
of time of between 3 and 5 seconds, depending on
what happens. The 20 value seemed like a good compromise. Feel free to modify it, however.
Holding One's Breath
A character can hold his or her breath for 30 seconds for each point of his or her Body. A character who
wants to hold his breath longer makes a Body (4) Test.
Each success increases the length of time the character
can hold his breath by 10 percent (round down).
Jumping
Characters can make four types of jumps: standing
jumps, running jumps, standing vertical jumps, and running vertical jumps. From a standing start, a character
can jump a number of meters equal to his one-half his
Strength minus his natural Body (unaugmented by
cyberware, bioware, or magic). For a running jump, the
character may add his Quickness (Quickness + Strength
- Body + 2 = meters jumped).
Use the same formulas for jumping vertically from a
standing or running start, but divide the result by 4.
To increase the distance jumped, a character makes
a Jumping Test against a target number equal to the
number of meters the character is trying to clear. Each
success increases the distance jumped by 10 percent
(round down).
A failed jump or a jump down may result in falling
(see Falling, p. 76).
Lifting/Throwing
A character can lift 25 kilograms per point of his
Strength without making any sort of test. To represent
augmented strength, the character makes a Strength
Test against a target number equal to the weight of the
object being lifted, divided by 10 (round up). Each success increases the weight lifted by 10 percent (round
down). Note that this rule applies to a simple lift off the
ground. A character can only lift over his head an object
that weighs 12 kilograms per point of Strength. In this
case, apply the Strength Test normally.
Once a character lifts an object over his head, he can
throw that object a number of meters equal to the character's Strength, minus the object's weight divided by
50 (round down). To increase the distance thrown, make
a Strength Test against a target number equal to the
weight of the object being lifted divided by 10 (round
up). For every 2 successes, the object flies an additional
meter.
Running
The Movement rules appear on p. 83, SRII. Characters with the Running Skill may attempt to increase the distance they can run by spending a
Complex Action (Use Skill). Each success against a Target Number of 4 increases the character's effective Quickness by 1 point for that Combat Phase. The gamemaster may apply modifiers for various types of terrain (slippery, rocky, and so on) and other conditions.
Swimming
Use the same rules to determine swimming speed and distance as for running, except divide all resulting distances by 4.
BATTLETAC™M SYSTEM
The most straightforward way to explain the benefits of the BattleTac™ and similar systems is to say that everyone using the system can freely exchange various types of data and information without restriction. This data may include map positioning, enemy positioning, current status, targeting data, video and aural information, tactical requests and commands, and anything else of import to the soldier.
When the system is operating, any piece of data known to one member of the "battle network" is known to all. For example, if one soldier sees an advancing enemy unit, all others in the "network" instantly know that force's composition, direction, heading, and speed.
Other members in the network can use this data as spotting information and call for indirect fire against that target, or maneuver to intercept or ambush those forces.
Because all members of the BattleTac™ unit see all information simultaneously, the unit can move like a wellprogrammed machine and react quickly to changing battlefield conditions.
The BattleTac™ system works in a manner similar to the telecommunication system described on p. xx. Use the ratings given for that system to represent signal security and encryption efficiency. If a system has BattleTac™ capability, multiply all prices by 10.
CAMOUFLAGE AND PERCEPTION
The modifiers given below apply to visual Perception Tests made to detect opponents wearing camouflage clothing. A moving character qualifies for
the "Action very obvious" modifier (see p. 185, SRII).

CASED VS. CASELESS AMMO
The Shadowrun rules and fiction occasionally mention caseless ammunition. Caseless ammunition is made
without a brass or plastic casing holding the propellant.
Instead, the propellant is a solid mass attached to the
tail of the bullet, and burns completely away when fired.
Caseless ammunition exists in fact as well as in fiction.
The following rules apply to caseless ammo.
.For the sake of simplicity, assume that any modern
firearm (post-2050) can be acquired in a model that fires
caseless ammunition. Increase the base cost by 50 percent and the Availability by +1.
.Caseless ammunition is available at 150 percent of
the base cost. Increase the Availability by +1.
·Caseless ammunition takes up slightly less space
than cased ammunition. Increase the number of rounds a
caseless weapon can load by 20 percent (round down).
Caseless ammo also weighs less, so reduce the appropriate weights by 20 percent (round up).
.Caseless ammunition cannot be used in a weapon
designed to fire cased ammunition, and vice versa.
All other normal firearms rules apply.

COMBAT ACCIDENTS
The following variant on the Rule of One creates a
greater chance of provoking accidental mayhem in combat. In ranged or melee combat, if the player rolls all of
his dice (Skill dice, Combat Pool dice, Enhancement
dice, everything) and achieves a number of ones equal
to or greater than the number of base Skill dice used for
the test, the result is an "Oops." The gamemaster determines the appropriate "Oops" for each situation. For
inspiration, see the Stray Shots optional rule, p. 93, SRII.
The character may also break, jam, or drop his weapon.
Be creative.
Yes, the character can spend Karma to avoid the
"Oops" per the rules given on p. 191, SRII.
COVER MODIFIERS
The SRII rules for ranged combat offer only a rudimentary modifier for obscured targets, called Partial
Cover (-4). The following optional rules expand the uses
of that modifier.
Attacking characters who want to use cover to protect against return fire may choose the amount of cover
they use, represented by a +2, +4, or +6 modifier. The
attacking character must also modify the target number
by one-half the cover modifier. For example, a character
partially concealing himself behind +4 cover must add a
+2 modifier to his attack because of that cover. (Hey,
hiding is awkward for you, too.)
Gamemasters may need to determine the amount of
cover protecting a target, especially when that cover is
environmental and coincidental (characters fighting in
the woods, an amusement park, and so on). The
gamemaster should base the modifier on how much of
the target is visible, using the Partial Cover Table below
as a guideline.
The gamemaster should judge how much of the target can be seen in terms of an overall area. For example,
if the gamemaster judges that the various areas of the
target (big and small) that can be seen through the brush
totals about 48.5 percent, the modifier would be +4.

COVERING/SUPPRESSION FIRE
A character may declare that he is making a ranged
attack to provide covering/suppression fire. This means
that the attacker is directing fire into an area to force his
opponents to keep their heads down for fear of being
hit. Covering/suppression fire usually allows the character's teammates to perform some action unopposed.
Each round fired effectively covers a 1-meter area for
10 Combat Phases. Multiple rounds may be targeted at a
single 1-meter area to increase the effectiveness of the
covering/suppression fire. If the attack covers multiple
areas, these areas must be directly adjacent to another
covered area.
If, during the time that the area is covered, a character enters that area, moves, and thereby exposes himself
to the covering/suppression fire, or presents his body to
fire within that area in any manner, he might be hit. If
line of sight can be drawn from the attacker to any part
of the target during the time the area is covered, the target is potentially vulnerable.
To determine if the covering/suppression fire strikes
the target character, resolve a Ranged Attack against the
target by rolling a number of dice equal to the number
of rounds fired at the area. The Target Number equals a
base of 4 modified only by Cover and any Damage
Modifier the attacker must add. Every 2 successes generated results in 1 round striking the target, up to a maximum of the number of rounds fired into the area.
CUSTOM WEAPONS
The owner of a weapon can customize its grip and
balance at a cost of 100 percent of the base weapon
cost. The work takes a weaponsmith approximately
three days to complete. A weapon customized for a particular character allows him to roll an additional skill die
when using this weapon. A character who uses a
weapon customized for someone else must subtract 1
die from his skill roll.
DELAYED ACTIONS AND SHORT MOVES
Characters who choose to Delay their Action may
move up to one-half (round up) their Walking rate during
the Combat Phase of their original Initiative. When the
character makes the Delayed Action, he may move normally.
Josh, a street samurai, is slowly advancing down a
corridor, watching the door at the end. His Initiative is
23, and so he Delays his action in Combat Phase 23. At
that time, he moves 3 meters down the corridor (half
his normal walking movement). His next action would
normally take place in Combat Phase 13. He maintains
the Delayed Action, but advances another 3 meters at
that time. He continues to Delay his actions and move
until he reaches the door.

DELAYED GRENADE RULES
Shadowrun grenades can be fired, scatter, and detonate all within one Combat Phase (a fraction of a second). The system resolves grenade attacks in this manner simply to cut down on the bookkeeping required.
Ambitious gamemasters and players may want to apply
the following delayed grenade rule.
Grenades detonate 5 Combat Phases after firing.
During that time another character with an available
action (either a Delayed Action or normal Initiative) may
retrieve the grenade and attempt to throw it back.
Characters must achieve at least 1 success on a
Quickness (8) Test to pick up a bouncing, jumping, skittering, mini-grenade. To pick up a regular-sized
grenade, characters must make a successful Quickness
(6) Test. If the test is unsuccessful, the character is at an
effective Range of 0 when the grenade detonates.
Have fun!
INSTANT DEATH AND OVER-DAMAGE
As written, the SRII rules make it effectively impossible to kill an unwounded character with a single attack.
In fact, an unwounded character can technically survive a
nuclear blast at ground zero, because the nuke only does
"D" damage with no Body Overflow. Though such a
result may look like an oversight, it was a deliberate
choice to avoid the potential disappointment of having a
player character taken down by a single attack, especially an unexpected attack or one against which the character cannot defend himself. In certain situations, however,
this choice becomes ludicrous. In these cases, apply the
following rule.
Normally, after a weapon's Damage Level has been
staged up to "D," additional successes are ignored. If the
Power of the attack is greater than twice (2x) the Body
Rating of the target, the gamemaster may invoke the
Over-Damage rule. With this rule, every 2 additional
successes translate into 1 additional point of damage
applied against the Physical Condition Monitor (if the
attack was Deadly Stun) or Body Overflow (if the attack
was Deadly Physical). For example, using the OverDamage rule, assume a character with a Body of 3 is
struck by a 7M attack. The attacker stages the damage
for a final Damage Level of Deadly, with an additional 4
successes remaining in the attacker's favor. The character
takes a Deadly wound and 2 points of Body Overflow,
leaving him with 1 point remaining and ten minutes
until he bleeds to death. If the attacker had achieved 2
additional successes, the poor character would be
instantly dead.
Use this rule cautiously: in addition to conveniently
killing those nasty bad guys, this rule handily kills
favorite player characters who might otherwise have narrowly survived to run the shadows another day.
LOW-LIGHT AND THERMAL SYSTEMS
The following information elaborates on the fundamental characteristics, differences, and capabilities of lowlight and thermographic systems. Theory and application
has been streamlined for simplicity and playability.
Low-Light Systems
Also known as night sight, night vision, or light
amplification, low-light systems involve an electronic
process that creates a coherent electronic image by
amplifying and processing even the tiniest amount of
available light. If no light is available, however, even the
best low-light system becomes useless.
The gamemaster has the final say on whether a situation offers sufficient light for a low-light system to work.
He or she simply decides if light is present. If not, then
the low-light system has no light to amplify and therefore has no effect. If light is present, even in such faint
sources as moonlight leaking through low cloud cover or
traces of a streetlight filtering into an abandoned basement, then the low-light system has something to
amplify.
The low-light system itself can provide the light
required for its use as either direct or area lighting. For
example, direct lighting could come from a penlight that
throws a focused beam of light. Even the tiniest glow
from a penlight, which cannot be seen from more than a
few meters away, can illuminate a map, a sign, or similar
small area or object well enough to create an image on
the system's screen. Characters who carry low-light systems usually attach a penlight or similar pinpoint light
source to a helmet or their finger to provide direct, subtle illumination on demand.
An area light combined with a low-light system is
sufficient to allow the person so equipped to move. This
light need not cover a large area; it could be as directional as a flashlight that subtly illuminates the area ahead of
the user. Such a light will be visible for some distance,
but only if the observer is looking into the beam.
Low-light systems are technologically based, and so
magic cannot be cast through them. The nature of lowlight vision requires an electronic amplification of light,
by definition a translation of the image to electronic
form. Because low-light cybereyes have been paid for
with Essence, however, the system becomes an accepted part of a character's body and can be used to cast
magic. Optical low-light systems use high-quality optics,
lenses, and/or mirrors rather than electronic imaging.
Their light-gathering capabilities are limited by the size
of the gathering lens. Effectively fancy telescopes, optical low-light systems are not portable.
Thermographic Systems
Thermographic systems read heat (infrared energy)
emitted by a target. This type of system provides few
details about the target, because it reveals only degrees of
heat. SRII assumes that modern (2050) thermal systems
actually superimpose the thermographic display over a
basic, amplified low-light display for better detail. The
result provides insufficient data to gain a bonus or modifier, but does allow the user to navigate past obstacles or
differentiate between objects while using the system.
Different systems use different color scales to represent the levels of heat, but most use the following standard. Hot objects (an engine block, a pot of boiling
water) show as white, while cool objects (room temperature) show as black, with every temperature difference
in between displaying as shades of red or green.
Remember that the system judges "hot" and "cold" in
relation to the local air or room temperature. For example, thermographic systems used outside in the winter
easily spot a person or vehicle, because they will appear
"hot" compared to the air temperature. On the other
hand, in the rain forests of South America little difference
exists between the ambient temperature (the forest's
"room temperature") and the radiated body heat of a
human being, making thermographic systems all but
useless for differentiating between the forest and a person. (Odds are that motion will give the target away, but
that's a different modifier.)
When characters are using thermographic systems,
the gamemaster must consider the relative temperature
of objects viewed against the ambient temperature to
determine if the system detects the target. In other
words, objects at a similar temperature show up on the
display as similar colors, making it difficult to differentiate between them if they overlap.
By definition, thermographic systems also require
technology and cannot be used when casting magic.
Because the user has paid Essence for thermographic
cybereyes, however, the system becomes an accepted
part of a character's body and can be used to cast magic.
Natural Low-Light and Thermal Vision
Natural low-light or thermographic vision, such as
the vision elves and dwarfs are born with, or the
enhanced senses available to a physical adept or critter,
is magical in nature. This type of vision works along principles similar to those of low-light and thermographic
systems, but performs better than any technology can.
Though a certain biological basis exists to explain this
visual ability, much of the effect can only be explained
through the application of magic.
Natural low-light or thermographic vision is
assumed to be always operating, providing vision
enhancements automatically as needed. For example, a
troll sees exactly what humans see when looking at the
same view, except that every object, person, and so on
is tinged with the heat it radiates. The hotter an object,
the more brilliant the color the troll sees. Objects that
are much hotter than their environment appear whiter,
surrounded by a faint glow. Trolls see this way normally,
and therefore can instantly perceive, process, and interpret what they see. Natural low-light or thermal vision is
an advantage, not a handicap.
MAXIMUM RATE OF FIRE
The following information offers a comprehensive version of the Shadowrun maximum rate of weapon fire.
·Regular weapons capable of burst-fire (see p.92,
SRII) fire 3 rounds per burst. A character can fire these
rounds twice within a Combat Phase (See Fire Weapon,
p.82, SRII).
·Regular weapons capable of full-auto fire (see pp.
92-93, SRII) can fire up to 10 rounds in 1 Combat Phase.
The firer may use these 10 rounds to make as many fullauto bursts of between 3 and 10 rounds per burst as he
wishes, up to a maximum of 10 total rounds that
Combat Phase.
·Minigun-class weapons can fire up to 15 rounds per
Combat Phase using the full-auto mode rules (pp.
92-93, SRII). The weapon always fires 15 rounds if those
rounds are available.
.Super machinegun-class weapons (new to this
sourcebook) fire a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat
Phase. They fire six-round bursts in burst-fire mode, and
full-auto bursts of between 6 and 15 rounds per burst,
up to a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat Phase.
The Shadowrun Combat Turn does not limit the
maximum number of rounds that a weapon can discharge within that turn. The cyclic or recycle rates of the
various weapons are assumed to be high enough to support the rates of fire cited above. A modern-day submachine gun has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, or
10 rounds per second. Shadowrun weapons have lower
cyclic rates in the interests of game balance, practicality,
survivability, and sanity.
MERCENARY CONTACTS
The mercenary equivalent of the fixer, known as the
dealer (same game statistics, different area of influence),
serves as the merc's source for weapons and equipment.
Even more so than the fixer, the dealer traffics regularly
in arms and accessories and therefore can more easily
get merc-related equipment, though the player character must wait longer to receive it. The dealer has more
pipelines to work through than the fixer does, but the
flow is slower.
To reflect this fact, decrease the target numbers for
acquisition through a dealer by -1 and increase the Time
Required by 25 percent (round down). The dealer contact should only be available to characters with a legitimate mercenary background. Gamemasters should
enforce this restriction to maintain game balance. Only
legitimate current or past members of the League can
work with a dealer.
OFF-HAND TRAINING
Off-hand training represents a character's ambidextrous ability acquired through the Special Skill:
Ambidexterity. A character can only acquire this skill
during character creation. It cannot be learned during
game play. This Special Skill costs 3 Skill Points per point
of Skill Rating. The Skill Rating can later be increased
using the normal rules for increasing a General Skill
(p.190, SRII).
This Special Skill is used in a unique way. Any time
the character attempts to use his off-hand (non-dominant hand), he must apply a negative modifier to the target number equal to the appropriate Skill Rating, minus
the Special Skill. So, a character with a Firearms Skill of 5
and Ambidexterity of 3 attempting to shoot with her offhand must apply a -2 (5 - 3) modifier. An Ambidexterity
Skill Rating higher than the rating of the skill being used
has no effect.
When using multiple firearms, characters must also
apply the Using A Second Firearm modifier (p. 90, SRII).
Second Weapon In Melee Combat
Characters may learn armed melee combat styles
that allow them to use a second weapon. The following
rules represent the effects of using a second melee
weapon in combat.
.The second weapon must be physically smaller and
lighter than the dominant weapon, unless they are both
small weapons (such as knives or daggers).
.The character must know how to use each of the
two weapons individually. (Yes, they may both fall under
the general skill Armed Combat.)
·The character must acquire a Special Skill for the
fighting style (Rapier and Dagger, and so on).
A character using two weapons in combat makes his
Attack Test by rolling a base number of dice equal to the
character's combined individual skills in the two weapons.
The character may add a number of Combat Pool dice up
to a maximum equal to the Special Skill rating.
Resolve damage by finding the average of the two
weapons used. First, calculate an unmodified average of
the Power of both weapons. If one weapon has a higher
Damage Level than the other, subtract 1 level from the
higher Damage Level and use the result as the Damage.
For example, a character using a sword with an "M"
Damage Level and a knife with an "L" Damage Level
would use an "L" Damage Level.
Resolve the use of both weapons with a single test
using the Power calculated above. Remember that
Shadowrun melee combat is not resolved blow by blow.
Instead, each Attack Test is an abstraction or amalgamation of a series of moves, blows, feints, parries, and countermoves. All other melee combat rules apply normally.
The stats for typical weapons used in two-weapon
combat appear below, abstracted in order to avoid printing a list of virtually identical weapons differentiated
only by their names.

PHYSICAL AND STUN DAMAGE
Characters may use weapons listed as inflicting Stun
Damage to inflict Physical Damage, such as clubs, fists, and
so on. A character who wishes to inflict Physical Damage
using a weapon normally rated as doing Stun Damage
must add a +4 modifier to the target number. The Damage
Code of the weapon remains the same, but the attack
results in Physical Damage rather than Stun Damage.
PULLING PUNCHES
Characters in melee combat can elect to "pull their
punches." To pull a punch, the player must state how
many successes are being "pulled" to lessen the blow
before the Attack Test is resolved. Increase the target
number by +1 and resolve the test normally. Determine
the total number of successes, then subtract the number
of successes being "pulled" from that value. Make this
calculation as soon as the successes are generated, but
before comparing the attacker's total successes to the
opponent's total successes.
Characters can also choose to decrease the effect of
a ranged attack. To do this, add a +4 modifier to the target number, then follow the rules given above.
RECOIL AND STRENGTH
The following rule suggests a way to allow characters who possess extraordinary Strength to suffer less
from firearm recoil than characters with standard
Strength. Because many characters with high Strength
Ratings rely heavily on firearms, this rule makes the
game even deadlier. (The troll carrying the light machine
gun should love this rule.)

SENSOR TARGETING OF HUMANS
Vehicle sensors can target people using an effective
Signature of 8. See Sensor-Enhanced Targeting, p.106,
Rigger Black Book.
SENTRY GUNS
The Sentry™ system uses microtronic technology
similar to the tactical computer found on p. 53,
Shadowtech. A tactical computer is a dedicated system
designed to keep track of all relevant combat data. The
computer derives its information from all available sensing devices, which means it is not foolproof. If the sensor cannot provide the appropriate information, the
computer may not be able to make correct decisions.
Each individual extra sensor type (low-light, audio, ultrasound) increases the tactical computer's Level by 1.
Access to a digital softmap of the area adds 2 to the tactical computer's Intelligence.
A tactical computer can keep track of, or "mark,"
and predict movements of a number of targets equal to
its Intelligence Rating. To successfully mark a target, the
tactical computer must make a Success Test pitting its
Intelligence against a target number based on the range
to the target (using standard shotgun ranges). Apply all
appropriate situation modifiers for ranged combat (p.
88-90, SRII). The extra successes generated for each target serve as the system's Success Level for that target.
The target can shake the computer's marking by
breaking out of the Sentry system's line of sight. Doing so
forces the computer to attempt to re-acquire the target
when the target becomes visible again. To attempt to reacquire the target, roll a number of dice equal to the system's Intelligence against a Base Target Number 1, modified by +1 for every meter the target moved while out of
line of sight and +1 for every full Combat Turn that has
passed. If this test succeeds, the Success Level for that target is now based on the successes generated in the test. If
the test is unsuccessful, the computer can attempt to remark the target on the system's next action. An accurate
map of the area in computer memory or accessible over a
data network (gamemaster's discretion) reduces the target
number of the Re-acquisition Test by -3.
The targeting feature and trajectory computation adds
an additional number of dice equal to the previously generated Success Level for a target to all Ranged Combat
Success Tests against that target. This modifier applies
only to those targets marked by the tactical system.
All system functions are background tasks, requiring
no actions to call up or perform. Though an attempt at a
new marking after a failed re-acquisition does not cost
an action, the computer can only attempt a new marking
during the system's action.
When the Sentry™ system fires on a target, use a
Skill Rating of 5, adding the following modifiers if using
the Enhanced Targeting option: +1 Enhanced Targeting
is installed and an additional +1 per additional integrated sensor. Resolve this combat per the normal rules.
SHOTGUN SOUND SUPPRESSION
Practically speaking, shotguns cannot use a silencer
or the rules that apply to it. A character using a shotgun
firing only slug rounds rather than shot/flechette rounds,
however, can install a sound suppresser. A shotgun
equipped with sound suppression cannot fire
shot/flechette rounds that use or require a choke.
A shotgun blast is the aural equivalent of full-auto
fire. Shotguns that can fire in burst or full-auto modes
cannot be equipped with a sound suppresser.
SMALL UNIT TACTICS
Characters with the Military Science Skill (ideally
coupled with the Small Unit Tactics Specialization) can
gain an Initiative bonus for their teammates under certain circumstances. The character with Small Unit Tactics
must make his or her last action of the Combat Turn a
Complex Action (Skill Use), even if he or she has only
one action available. The character then makes the Skill
Test against a base Target Number of 4, with the following considerations and modifiers.
·The character with tactical skill must be in contact
or communication with everyone who is to receive the
Initiative bonus.
.If the character with tactical skill has only radio (or
similar) communication with his team members, add a
+2 modifier to the Skill Test target number.
.If all members of the team are linked by the
BattleTac™ system (see Field Pack, p. 59) or another
similar system, apply a -2 modifier.
.Apply all appropriate Damage Modifiers.
Team members in communication with the character
possessing tactical skill receive a bonus to their Initiative
for the next Combat Turn equal to +1 for every 2 successes the tactical character generates. The tactical character may add Karma Pool dice to his Skill Test.
This bonus also applies in surprise and ambush situations. See p. 86, SRII.
SMARTLINK LEVEL II
The Smartlink Level II hardware and software represents
an evolutionary increase in smartgun technology. Most of
the changes have no effect in game terms; the Smartlink
simply feels better and works more efficiently. Smartlink
Level II offers the following game system benefits.
.Smartlink Level II software can integrate with a
rangefinder to provide an additional -1 target modifier
at long range and a -2 target modifier at extreme range.
.Called Shots (p. 92, SRII) are easier to make with
Smartlink Level II. Apply a +4 Called Shot modifier when
using Smartlink Level II.
.Smartlink Level II can calculate indirect-fire arcs,
applying a -1 modifier for linked weapons such as
under-barrel grenade launchers, grenade guns, and the
like. This benefit also applies to rocket launchers and
similar systems, but not to missile launchers and other
systems with an inherent Intelligence Rating.
SMOKE RULES
Smoke can be deployed using a grenade or other
smoke-producing device. The amount of smoke produced is limited by the size of the device used. How
long the smoke lasts depends on the environment.
If the smoke is deployed in an area with no wind,
the smoke lingers in the area of impact until the duration
expires. If the smoke is deployed in an area with wind,
the smoke cloud will stretch and thin out in the direction
the wind is blowing. Gamemasters can use the Scatter
diagram (p. 97, SRII) to determine wind direction. To
determine wind speed and its effects on duration, roll
one six-sided die. The result is the number of Combat
Turns it takes for the center (the bulk) of the smoke to
drift 1 meter in the direction of the wind. Next, divide
the smoke's duration by the result of the roll. The result
represents the smoke's new duration as it dissipates in
the wind. If the characters involved are exchanging gunfire or attempting to observe something, the gamemaster must determine on a case-by-case basis whether the
characters can see through an area of thinning smoke
(Light Smoke per p. 89, SRII) or if the bulk of the smoke
obstructs their actions (Heavy Smoke per p. 89, SRII).

TARGET DESIGNATORS
Target designators mark a target and assist in aiming. The simplest target designator is the laser sight,
which emits a beam of visible laser light that strikes the
target and marks it with a red dot. The dot lets the firer
know exactly where he or she is aiming and allows him
to adjust the shot.
All target designators operate on variations of this
principle. With regard to more complicated designators,
the individual using the target designator is not the individual firing the weapon; that individual could be kilometers away. The weapon may even be automated and fired
by remote command. The two basic types of target designators are laser sights and reflected-energy designators.
Laser Sight
The basic laser sight described on p. 240, SRII can
mark a target with a visible red dot at a distance of up to
500 meters at night and 50 meters during the day.
Smoke and other environmental conditions, however,
may block this laser sight. Divide the listed range by 2
for light rain, mist, or fog, by 4 for heavy rain, mist, fog,
or smoke, and by 10 for downpours and very thick
smoke. To find a laser sight's day range under these
conditions, divide the listed night range by 10.
Characters using a laser sight gain a -1 modifier to their
ranged combat target number if they can see the dot.
The high-powered laser sight is a more powerful
version of the basic sight. It offers a night range of 1,500
meters and a day range of 150 meters. The same environment and target modifier rules apply.
Reflected-Energy Designators
A reflected-energy designator effectively functions
as an even higher-powered laser sight, but serves a different purpose. A designator is designed to mark a target with reflected energy such as laser light, microwave,
or radar. A weapon with the appropriate tracking/seeker
head can then home in on this reflected energy.
In all cases, the weapon skill of the character using
the designator determines whether the weapon (regardless of the type) hits the target. Weapons that home in
on designated targets require that the designator keep
the beam (laser, microwave, or radar) on the target. For
laser designators (which can be top-mounted on a riflesized weapon), the designating character uses the
Firearms (Rifle) Skill. For microwave or radar designators,
use the character's Gunnery Skill. All normal ranged
combat rules apply, but consult the Weapon Range Table
on p. 87 of this book for the designator in use. Note that
microwave and radar designators can be mounted on a
tripod for field use or vehicle mounted. (To mount one
on a vehicle requires 1 CF or cargo area; see p. 113,
Rigger Black Book.)
Smoke blocks laser designators, and chaff blocks
microwave and radar designators. For game purposes,
assume that the mere presence of smoke or chaff intervening between the target and the designator blocks the
beam. (Reality is more complex, but this rule is not
intended as a military simulation.) The gamemaster must
determine on a case-by-case basis the location of emitted smoke or chaff in relation to the position of the designator. Also, for the sake of simplicity, assume that all
missile or rocket weapons have a flight-time of 1,000
meters per Combat Turn.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS
The Phillips Tacticom system described on p. 58 of
this book is a sophisticated piece of military electronics.
The statistics for the system, however, are also representative of other brands and systems that serve a similar
function. For example, the statistics for the two master
units work equally well for vehicle systems, the larger
master unit available for vehicles with the available
space (or budget), and the smaller, lighter portable master unit fitting into vehicles that offer less room.
This equipment conforms with the Using Equipment
rules, p. 184, SRII. It has an ECM/ECCM Rating equal to
the rating of the equipment.
The large master unit has a tactical range of 30 kilometers, the portable master unit a range of 20 kilometers. The manufacturer designed the Tacticom system
with this short range to ensure signal security and
reduce the probability of long-range detection.
Communication is two-way voice-only. The master units
are encrypted at the rating of the equipment.
Individual team members carry the system's personal comm unit: with a range of 12 kilometers, also made
deliberately short for greater security. Note that beyond
12 kilometers these units can receive messages from a
master unit, but cannot respond. ‹
The microwave link is a small, flat-transmitter
microwave system that provides greater signal security
by virtue of its position at line-of-sight to the horizon.
This same feature also creates a disadvantage because
the user must be able to trace a direct line of sight
between the link's sender and receiver. The microwave
signal is only marginally affected by weather, and can
only be intercepted by someone or something lying on
or very close to the path of the microwave beam.
Because the real workings of microwave communication
systems and other systems equally subtle and involved
are beyond the effective scope of Shadowrun,
gamemasters should use these guidelines to rule on the
many and varied circumstances that are bound to arise
during play.
The laser link works on a principle similar to the
microwave link, except that communication relies on a
laser beam. This system also requires a direct line of
sight, but a tighter beam and virtually nonexistent leakage creates higher signal security. Laser links have a
range out to the horizon in clear weather, but range
degrades radically in inclement weather. Heavy rain,
fog, or smoke renders the system virtually useless.
Satellite uplinks bounce the signal off a communications satellite and down to the master unit. The uplink
contains all the software necessary for satellite tracking
and linking. This system provides high signal security
and minimal atmospheric interference.
WHITE PHOSPHORUS
White phosphorus is a chemical that burns at very
high temperatures when exposed to air. Early smoke
grenades spread a curtain of white phosphorus, which
created smoke, caused secondary-effect casualties, and
ignited combustible materials. Modern (2050) smoke
grenades work on the same principle, but burn a less
lethal substance to create smoke.
Various suppliers still produce white phosphorus
weapons, but their smoke-producing effects are secondary to their incendiary and damage effects. Grenades
and mortar rounds designed to deliver white phosphorus have two Damage Codes, the first representing the
small blast effect of the actual explosion and the second
representing the lingering effect of the white phosphorus. The chemical affects all targets within the area of
effect equally. The phosphorous burns continuously for
15 Combat Turns, inflicting the indicated damage every
Combat Turn (resolved at the start of each turn during
the first Combat Phase). Characters can resist this damage using Body dice only. Impact Armor reduces the
Power of the attack. White phosphorus is difficult to
extinguish because it re-ignites whenever exposed to
air. Water diffuses white phosphorus; if an affected area
or target can be immersed or doused with water, the
chemical's effects end in 2 Combat Turns.
