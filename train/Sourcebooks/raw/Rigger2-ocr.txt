INTRODUCTION
If the only thing that comes to mind when you think of a rigger is the "car chick" oreven worse-the "getaway guy," then this book is for you. For those of you who always
wished the rigger character could fulfill its potential as a vital element of the Shadowrun
team-from commanding drones, to taking control of a security-rigged building or even using
* vehicle as a weapon to hit stuff that gets in the way (including those pesky pedestrians)well, you've found a home, chummer. Rigger 2 includes everything you want to know about
rigging and riggers in a single volume, from character creation to vehicle creation, from vehicle combat to drone use to rigging a security system.
The rules contained in this volume replace the rigger rules published in Shadowrun,
Second Edition and the Rigger Black Book.
Rigger 2 begins with The Rigger, which talks about the rigger from the perspective of
dice pools, skills and concentrations, cyberware/bioware and even Edges and Flaws. This section also covers what it takes to be a rigger, including insights into the mind and emotions of
someone jacked into a vehicle.
From there we go straight into Standard Vehicle Operations, which covers everything
from the basic Driving Test to vehicle statistics and attributes. This section describes what a
vehicle can and can't do, and introduces the concept of Stress-the idea that a vehicle will
wear down if not cared for properly. That's right, we've given the gamemaster even more
options for parting a rigger from his hard-earned nuyen.
Now, what good is becoming your vehicle if you can't see what's going on around you?
The Sensors chapter is devoted entirely to explaining how a rigger uses the sensors of his
vehicle to observe and affect his world. This section also includes the basics of Electronic
Countermeasures (ECM) and Electronic Deception (ED). The chapter on Special Vehicle
Operations offers rules for operating everything from VTOLs and other airborne vehicles to
hovercraft and vehicles with arms, and even pulling and towing vehicles.
Now that your rigger is fully constructed and knows his vehicles inside and out, it's time
to test his abilities on the street. The chapter on Vehicle Combat provides rules to cover every
situation, from auto chases to running down pedestrians. An expanded turn sequence incorporates the rigger's actions into the flow of the standard Combat
Turn. The rules for magic and vehicles have been expanded and
updated, offering the opportunity to include every facet of the
awakened world into a single running fight! Rigger 2 also gives
the rigger the tools for the next step: firing her weapons directly
from the vehicle. Vehicle Gunnery gives target numbers and
modifiers for all vehicle-mounted and hand-held weapons, including missile rules. The addition of indirect fire and area-effect rules
are custom-designed to ramp up the paranoia level in every city
where your team runs the shadows.
But if you think that's all a rigger can handle, you're wrong.
The Drones chapter describes those special friends of the rigger
that allow him to see everything and be everywhere at once. This
chapter covers all remote control operations needed to sic these
mechanical nightmares on your enemies, and introduces a new
element to the world of Shadowrun-robotics. Riggers interested
in working from a more defensive posture can conduct Electronic
Warfare using a remote control deck to interfere with security
operations from a distance, taking advantage of a variety of tactics, from jamming transmissions to taking control of an enemy's
drones. Finally, for those riggers who like to fight up close and
personal, the Security Rigger section fleshes out the rules on rigging a building. These rules cover everything from breaking into a
security system to a network combat between two riggers fighting to take control of an entire security system.
The Advanced Rules section is for those players and
gamemasters who just want more. This chapter offers Quality
Factors (consider them Edges and Flaws for vehicles; it's the little
things you do to get your truck started in winter, the funky way
you park the car to keep it from rolling, the glitch in the hatch
hydraulics ... ); rules for fuel consumption; advanced gunnery,
sensor and electronic warfare rules; and rules for damaging vehicle subsystems.
Perhaps the most-often heard request in Shadowrun is for
rules that allow a rigger to modify or create his own ride. Well, the
wait is over! Vehicle Design and Customization offers a complete set of rules to create your own vehicle or modify existing
ones, by adding everything from turrets to state-of-the art armor
to super-injected engines to ejector seats. We even answer the
burning question of how can a dwarf drive a car? New Toys
speaks for itself-new toys made with the rigger-mad player character in mind. Missiles, drones, vehicles, mines, cyberware
(including the head-implanted remote control deck) and even the
first and newest robots on the market.
Finally, the Vehicle List provides a complete list of all vehicles ever published in Shadowrun products, updated to correspond to the rules in this book.

THE DEVELOPER'S SAY
In many ways, this book represents a completed first edition
more than a second edition. The existing Shadowrun rules relegated the rigger to the status of a non-player character; not
because his role was insufficiently thought-out, but because the
rigger was not given enough rules within the system to spread his
wings. Vehicle combat was abstracted so far as to be unusable,
and drone combat was barely covered at all. Situations that seem
tailor-made for riggers-pre-shadowrun surveillance, drones aiding mercs and mages on a run, riggers taking care of or taking
over the security of a target locale-these were tasks that rigger
players wanted to perform, but the rules just didn't cover what
they needed to do their jobs.
The players were asking for ways to better integrate this character into the shadowrun team, and for more things to do with a
rigger character. We chose to not focus this book on vehiclesthat direction always poses the risk of turning a roleplaying game
into a tactical, table-top vehicle-based game. Instead, we wanted
to include the rigger in the action of the game, to find a way to
incorporate his vehicle actions into the turn along with those characters who were decking, shooting guns and chucking spells.
The result was a vastly expanded rules system. To begin with,
the vehicle rules went from a scant six pages in Shadowrun,
Second Edition to 174 pages in this book. We focused on stripping those six pages of rules down to their core and relaying the
foundation, at the same time making sure that the rigger
remained integrated into the flow of the game session. Few things
are more frustrating than for the game to slow to a crawl as the
rigger and gamemaster try to figure out how they should resolve
* monstrous hole in the rules (exactly how fast were you going
and how much damage should you take from hitting that troll
with your Dodge Scoot?).
While the options and actions for driving are fun for the rigger, nothing says Shadowrun like doing a lot of damage. We
needed rules for using guns, from firing missiles to having a good
buddy fire that turret-mounted Ingram Valiant out the back of the
mini-van. These rules needed to give the player a sense of his rigger's place in the battle, and to cover launching missiles, remote
targeting and area-effect damage.
Having fleshed out the rules that existed, we moved on to
rules that didn't exist-rules for things the rigger clearly was
meant to do, but was never given the necessary information to
execute. The primary lack in the rules was for drone use. In my
ideal Shadowrun world, drones would be used as often as guns,
spirits and cyberdecks. Drones and the use of remote control
vehicles-one of the coolest parts of being a rigger, in my opinion-were so woefully underdeveloped that the rigger was in
danger of dying out from lack of interest. The idea of a shadowrun
team using drones as "the sixth man on the team" was left to novelists and players' imaginations, mainly because the rules gave
you nothing to work with. My mission for this book was to remedy that missing game application.
As you can see, just putting in the basics and making sure
those basics fit into the world of Shadowrun, and then making
sure the rules appealed to both the casual rigger player and the
most serious motorhead took on us on a mission to reinvent the
wheel-a wheel that can be jacked into, of course. As soon as we
were sure that we'd covered all the basics, of course, we had a
whole new set of concerns and questions. Those concerns and
questions led to sections on sensors, things that mess with sensors, electronic warfare and an expansion of the idea of the security rigger.
Our final goal was to create a vehicle and drone construction
system, which was needed to fill the second biggest lack in the
existing rules. Aware that a vehicle design system could easily
become a micro-management affair of square roots, fractional
multipliers and such advanced math that only NASA engineers
could figure it out, we chose to create a template system with a
single cost multiplier. This system allows players to both modify a
"stock" version of any vehicle or drone in the Shadowrun universe and to create their own designs using stock parts. This
forced us to define the stock types of vehicles, generate options
and create the "personal touches" that would make the rigger's
toys fit into the world we created for everyone else in the Sixth
World-so there are hidden gun ports, turrets, ejector seats, enviro-seals, stealth armor and security devices that range from
annoying to deadly.
Our template system also required us to make sure that all
existing vehicles worked with that system. We re-evaluated each
and every vehicle we had published to date, adjusting the numbers when necessary to bring them into line with the vehicle
design system. And just to make it easy for everyone, we compiled a list of all existing vehicles and their stats: everything that a
player may wish to have and a gamemaster may want to use can
be found at the back of this book.
We rounded out the book with new rigger toys, advanced
rules for nearly every aspect of the rigger, record sheets and fiction. And that's how six pages in one book turned into this tome
you hold in your hands.
But don't panic yet! The rules presented in this book can be
broken down into easily digestible pieces, depending how much
you want to use. Start with the standard vehicle operations and
sensors. From there, toss in some vehicle combat and gunnery.
That logically takes you to electronic warfare and security riggers.
If a rules section seems too advanced, skip it and use it when you
are ready. If you never use electronic warfare, that's fine-use
what you want and use what you need (but we highly recommend getting drones into your game right away!). Rigger 2 was
created to help you have fun when you play Shadowrun, not to
get in the way of your enjoyment. If something in this book isn't
working for you, skip it and figure it out later. We are confident
you will find more in this book that you want to use than not-so
jack in, boys and girls, and hit the streets. The only thing that can
stop you now is your imagination ... or a fully armored Lone Star
Security team!
THE RIGGER
Neither fish nor fowl, neither decker nor street warrior, the rigger may be the most unique
and misunderstood character in the Shadowrun universe. This chapter strips the rigger down to
the numbers and rebuilds him to illustrate the process of creating a rigger character.
CHARACTER CREATION
Either the priority system (p. 47, SRII) or the point-based system (p. 20, Shadowrun
Companion (SRComp)) can be used to create rigger characters. No racial restrictions apply to
rigger characters.
SKILLS AND CONCENTRATIONS
Riggers must be proficient in a number of different skills if they want to stay in biz beyond
their first runs. For obvious reasons, Vehicle Skills are most important for a rigger, but other
skills such as Build and Repair, Gunnery and Electronics will also help a rigger do his job.
Vehicle Skills and Defaulting
Nearly every time a rigger character jacks into a vehicle, he will have to perform some
feat that requires a Driving Test. Consequently, Vehicle Skills are a must for riggers. And
because the simsense experience of rigging translates vehicle actions into body maneuvers
and sensations, riggers can default between Vehicle Skills and Concentrations more easily than
non-riggers.
Whenever a rigger controlling a vehicle or remote control deck via a vehicle control rig
(VCR) attempts to default to a Vehicle Skill or Concentration from another Vehicle Skill, Vehicle
Concentration or Reaction Attribute, each dot crossed adds a +1 modifier instead of the standard +2 modifier. This half-modifier rule applies only when a rigger is jacked in and only when
the rigger defaults from Reaction or a Vehicle Skill/Concentration to another Vehicle
Skill/Concentration. A rigger cannot use this rule if attempting to default to or from a nonVehicle Skill (including Vehicle Build/Repair Skills).
Characters who do not possess VCR cyberware cannot use this half-modifier rule when
driving a vehicle using a datajack, even if the vehicle is adapted for rigger operation.
Deacon, a landlubber rigger who possesses the Car
Skill, finds himself on a run involving a waterborne infiltration of McNeil Island in Puget Sound. Fortunately,
Deacon's employer generously "loaned" him a rigged
Aztech Nightrunner for the job.
Deacon doesn't have the Motorboat Skill needed to
operate the Nightrunner, so he must default from his Car
Skill to the Motorboat Skill. On the Revised Skill Web (p.
47, SRComp), a default from the Car to the Motorboat
Skill crosses four dots, which normally would impose a
+8 modifier to any Driving Tests made with the defaulted skill. However, Deacon is a rigger and the boat is
equipped with a VCR, so the default imposes a +4 modifier to Deacon's Driving Tests.
Build/Repair Skills
Build/Repair Skills are used for modifying and upgrading vehicles as well as repairing damaged vehicles. In addition to the standard Vehicle B/R Skills, characters or their mechanics need the
Electronics or Computer B/R Skill to install or repair certain vehicle
components such as drones, electronic countermeasures (ECM)
and drive-by-wire systems.
If a particular installation or repair task calls for Skill Tests with
more than one B/R Skill, the character must succeed in all tests to
successfully complete the specified task.
If one required B/R test succeeds and another fails, the character can repeat the failed test, but the target number increases by
+1 for each subsequent test. The test target number does not
return to its original value until the player character increases his
or her B/R Skill.
When reducing the base time required to accomplish a specific task, a player can combine the successes generated on all
required tests. However, if any required test produces a result of
all "1s," the entire attempt at the task suffers a disastrous failure.
Gunnery Skill
The Gunnery Skill comes into play any time a rigger uses a
vehicle weapon while rigging, whether mounted on the vehicle
he's jacked into or on a drone he is controlling via a remote control deck. No matter what the nature of the weapon in question,
the Gunnery Skill rather than the Firearms Skill applies because the
mindset of firing a vehicle weapon shares more with the Gunnery
Skill than with the Firearms Skill. The latter focuses primarily on
the discipline of the physical body-body positioning, breath control and trigger squeeze-while the former favors mental procedures such as proper sight picture, range estimation and determining maximum effective kill zones.
The Gunnery Skill includes a Concentration for Indirect Fire. For
information on using this special skill, see Indirect Fire, p. 60.
Computer and Electronics Skills
Certain concentrations of the Electronics and Computer Skill
are especially useful to riggers. The Control Systems Concentration of the Electronics Skill applies to actions working with a
remote control deck, while the Electronic Warfare Concentration
is used when conducting electronic warfare.
The Non-Matrix Programming Specialization of the Computer
Skill is used to phrase commands to drones in an ordered, logical
manner that a drone's "dog-brain" can understand. The specialization allows the controlling player to add additional dice to a
drone's Comprehension Test.
See Issuing Commands, page 66, for more information on
using these Skills and Concentrations.
Vehicle Stealth Concentration
The Vehicle Stealth Concentration of the Stealth Skill covers
the same activities as the standard Stealth Skill (sneaking around,
tracking, tailing and so on) but applies when a character is driving
vehicles. Characters may also further specialize in this
Concentration in any of the normal aspects of the Stealth Skill.
Vehicle Tactics Specialization
The Vehicle Tactics Specialization of the Tactics Concentration
helps characters coordinate the tactics of small groups of vehicles.
The Specialization works in conjunction with the new BattleTac
IVIS system, which enhances the coordination between drones
performing a common mission. For more information on the use
of this Specialization, see The BattleTac IVIS System (p. 67).
EDGES AND FLAWS
Edges and Flaws (p. 21, SRComp) provide additional depth
to player characters. Because of the nature of the vehicle control
rig (as well as simsense technology in general), certain Edges and
Flaws will have different effects on a character jacked into a vehicle. These effects are noted in the following entries.
Adrenaline Surge
The Adrenaline Surge Edge applies only to physical actions in
the physical world. The Edge has no effect on the actions of a
character who is jacked into a rigged system or into the Matrix.
Additionally, the Edge has no effect on a character who is driving
* rigged vehicle using a datajack link.
Bio-Rejection
The Bio-Rejection Flaw causes a character's body to reject
cyberware implants, including the implants required to operate a
vehicle control rig. Consequently, riggers cannot take this Flaw.
Blind and Deaf
Individual gamemasters and players must determine if the
Blind and Deaf Flaws affect the actions of specific characters jacked
into rigs or the Matrix. Simsense works by directly stimulating the
vision and hearing centers in the occipital lobe of the brain, so if
either of these Flaws is caused by a nerve defect, it may not affect
* character who is rigging. However, if the Flaw is caused by a
brain disorder, it can make rigging impossible.
If these Flaws do not affect a character's rigging actions, the
Blind Flaw is worth -2 and the Deaf Flaw is worth -1. If the Flaws do
affect a character's rigging, both Flaws are worth their full values.
Night Blindness
This Flaw does not apply when rigging, because rigged vehicle sensors have image-intensifying capabilities and automatically
adjust the brightness level of simsense visual stimuli to match the
brain's visual capability.
Night Vision
This Edge does not apply when rigging. See the Night
Blindness Flaw.
NEW EDGES AND FLAWS
The following new Edges and Flaws were designed with riggers in mind, but they may be applied to any character archetype,
including non-technical characters such as magicians, at the
gamemaster's discretion.
SKILL FLAWS
Computer Illiterate
Value: - 3
* character with the Computer Illiterate flaw has extreme difficulty working with computers and other electronic devices. Such
characters have trouble performing such simple tasks as using an
unfamiliar telecom, sending e-mail or programming a trideo
recorder.
During game play, the character receives a +1 modifier to all
tests that involve a computer or some other electronic device in
any way, shape or form (for example, a mage with this Flaw would
suffer this modifier when attempting to read another mage's electronic hermetic library). Additionally, the gamemaster may require
the character to make Success Tests (Target Number 2 or 3) to
complete tasks that most people in 2058 take for granted (this can
be used to add dramatic tension or comic relief to a game).
Even techno-junkies such as riggers and deckers may have
this Flaw, because simsense technology, icon-oriented Matrix
programming and the boom of reality filters and sculpted systems
have greatly reduced the level of technical know-how needed to
rig or deck.
MENTAL EDGES AND FLAWS
Sensitive Neural Structure
Value: - 2 or -4
Characters with a Sensitive Neural Structure have an especally delicate nervous system and are more vulnerable to neural
damage from BTLs, black IC, rigger dump shock and other damaging forms of simsense. Whenever a character with this Flaw
must resist these types of damage, reduce the character's effective Willpower Rating by 1 for a -2 Flaw, and by 2 for a -4 Flaw.
Willpower may not be reduced below 1 this way.
Simsense Vertigo
Value: - 2
Characters who suffer from Simsense Vertigo experience feelIngs of disorientation when they use cyberdecks, vehicle control
rigs, entertainment simrigs, smartlinks, display links or any other
simsense technology. Such characters receive an additional +1
modifier to all target numbers and a -1 modifier to Initiative when
operating any simsense-related device.
Spike Resistance
Value: 2 or 4
Characters with the Spike Resistance Edge have increased
resistance to high simsense spikes and harmful forms of ASIST,
such as black IC or rigger dump shock. When such characters
resist these types of simsense-related damage, increase the character's effective Willpower by 1 for every 2 points of Spike
Resistance the character possesses.
OTHER EDGES AND FLAWS
Gremlins
Value: - 1, -2, -3 or -4
Any equipment touched by a character with the Gremlins
Flaw immediately displays an odd tendency to malfunction. Any
time such a character handles a piece of equipment, roll 2D6. On
* result of 2, the equipment breaks down. The severity of the failure depends on the value of the Flaw.
On a 1-point Flaw, affected equipment operates with a +1 or
-1 modifier, whichever works against the character. The modifiers
apply to both Success Tests and effect-value ratings (such as a
weapon's Power, a sensor's Flux Rating, a cyberdeck's MPCP and
so on). To make such equipment work, the character must expend
* Simple Action to bang the device against a hard surface. The
equipment will function normally during the character's next
Combat Phase.
On a 2-point Flaw, affected equipment simply does not work.
Again, a sharp jolt (and a Simple Action expended by the character)
will bring the unit back on-line in the character's next Combat Turn.
On a 3-point Flaw, the equipment suffers a major malfunction
and operates with a +2 or -2 modifier (again, whichever is detrimental to the character). The modifier applies to Success Tests and
effect-value ratings.
Such equipment must be repaired before it will work again.
To find the cost of such repairs, multiply the equipment's cost by
.2 and add the result to the repairman's labor charges, if applicable (see The Mechanic Contact, p. 19).
On a 4-point Flaw, the equipment breaks down and ceases to
work. Only a major overhaul (and some raised eyebrows from the
local repairman) will get the unit functioning again. To find the
cost of this repair, multiply the equipment's cost by .5. Add labor
charges to the result, if applicable.
If a character with the Gremlins Flaw is driving a vehicle, one
of the vehicle's major subsystems (steering, brakes, sensors and
so on) or special modifications or features (customized engines,
vehicle weapons, special accessories and the like) may be affected. The gamemaster can roll for each separate item or simply roll
once and choose the system that goes down.
The Gremlins Flaw has no effect on cyberware, bioware or
magical equipment such as ritual materials, foci and fetishes.
However, the Flaw may affect hermetic libraries on electronic
media, resulting in lost files, unrecoverable memory errors, short
circuits or even an electrical fire.
Vehicle Empathy
Value: 2
Characters with this Edge seem to understand vehicles better
than most people and can coax improved performance from vehicles simply by being in physical contact with them. Whenever
such a character is in physical contact with a machine (either
through manual controls or jacked into the vehicle), reduce the
Handling of the vehicle by 1.
DICE POOLS
Dice Pools enable player characters to use extra dice during
Skill Tests. Each specific Dice Pool rating determines how many
dice are available in a character's Dice Pools, but the number of
Dice Pool dice added to a particular test may never exceed the
character's rating in the test's skill. All Dice Pools refresh at the
beginning of each Combat Turn.
* number of different pools-specifically, the Control Pool,
Combat Pool and the Task Pool-come into play when a rigger is
jacked into a machine. The new IVIS Pool applies when using
drones equipped with the IVIS system.
The following rules for these Dice Pools replace the Dice Pool
rules presented on pages 84-85 of SRII.
CONTROL POOL
The Control Pool is equal to the rigger's Reaction, plus any
enhancements gained from the vehicle control rig (VCR) cyberware. Any indirect modifiers from cerebral boosters and
encephalons apply as well.
Control Pool dice may be added to any test that deals strictly with the control of a vehicle. They may be used on Maneuver
Tests and tests made to resist damage from attacks against a character's vehicle, but they may not be used for tests made when firing vehicle weapons or using vehicle sensors.
COMBAT POOL
The rigger may add dice from the Combat Pool to any
Gunnery Tests made for firing vehicle weapons using a rig.
However, the number of Combat Pool dice cannot exceed the
character's Gunnery Rating. If the character is using a
Concentration or Specialization, the Combat Pool dice may not
exceed the Concentration or Specialization Level.
TASK POOL
The Task Pool is available to any character who possesses an
encephalon or a cerebral booster (pp. 49, 23, Shadowtech). Task
Pool dice may be applied to Technical, Knowledge and
Build/Repair Skill tests.
The Task Pool is important to riggers because players can add
Task Pool dice to Electronics Tests, which come into play in
remote control, sensor and electronic warfare operations. (See
Electronic Warfare, p. 69, for more information on the use of the
Electronics Skill and its Concentrations in rigger operations.)
IVIS POOL
The IVIS Pool is available to riggers controlling drones
equipped with the BattleTac IVIS system. When using the IVIS system, the rigger may use IVIS Pool dice to augment tests made
when his drones are performing group tasks. For more information, see The BattleTac IVIS System, page 67.
THE VEHICLE CONTROL RIG
Vehicle control rig (VCR) cyberware sets the rigger apart from
all other Shadowrun characters. Without this piece of cyberware,
the rigger is just another combat-oriented character who can drive
* car. The VCR translates the rigger's neural impulses into various
vehicle operations-stop, accelerate, turn left, fire turret gun, perform sensor sweep and so on-so that the vehicle responds
almost instantaneously to the rigger's mental command.
* vehicle control rig gives the rigger a Control Pool, as well
as conferring Reaction and Initiative bonuses for vehicle and drone
combat. Reaction and Initiative bonuses normally provided by
other factors do not apply; the VCR is the only source of such
bonuses for the rigger engaged in vehicle and drone combat.
RIGGING VERSUS DECKING
Rigging and decking both use simsense virtual simulation
technology, and riggers and deckers both rely on pure brainpower to do the job. However, that is where the similarities between
the two end.
When decking the Matrix, a character uses the higher intelligence centers of his brain. In contrast, rigging a vehicle is much
more reflexive and instinctive-much like playing an arcade
game-and most of the required mental activity takes place in the
rigger's lower brain. Consequently, deckers cannot interact with a
vehicle control rig, as they lack the proper hardware to interface
with a vehicle control rig's ASIST protocols. Deckers and other
characters without VCR implants can jack into a rigged vehicle if it
has a datajack link and drive it normally, but they gain no bonuses other than the +1 to Reaction associated with a standard datajack connection (see Datajack Port, p. 124).
Deckers and other non-riggers with datajacks may also interact with rigged remote control decks in the "captain's chair"
mode (see Operative Modes, p. 65), but they cannot interface
directly with, or "jump into," a drone (see p. 65). Likewise, deckers cannot use Response Increase hardware to improve their
Reaction or Initiative. Non-riggers cannot interface with a CCSS
security system, while deckers can do so only with a special
accessory and severely degraded performance (see Decking a
Rigged System, p. 80).
Conversely, riggers tend to be sloppy deckers, as their
enhanced thalami encourage knee-jerk reactions rather than the
intense cerebral concentration necessary for surfing the Matrix. To
reflect this, rigger characters suffer a +1 modifier to all target numbers when decking in the Matrix. Additionally, reduce the rigger's
Hacking Pool by the level of his VCR.
The Jackson Street Posse suffers a major loss when
its decker is geeked in a gang ambush after leaving a
meet with a Mr. Johnson. So when the team needs some
information from the Matrix for its next run, it turns to its
resident rigger, Otto Matick, because he's the only
remaining team member with a
datajack. Otto jacks into the decker's Fuchi-6 and dives into the net.
Otto has an Intelligence of 4,
which, combined with the Fuchi6's MPCP Rating of 8, would normally give him a Hacking Pool of 4
[(4 + 8) + 3, using the Hacking Pool
formula on p. 18 of Virtual
Realities 2.0]. However, Otto's
Level 2 VCR reduces his Hacking
Pool to 2.
* rigger can get around the
Hacking Pool handicap in two ways.
First, the rigger can install a second
datajack that bypasses his VCR
cyberware and connects directly
to his
cerebral
cortex.
Alternatively, the
rigger may
install a
VCR with
* reflex
trigger,
which enables
him to turn his
VCR on or off with a
Simple Action. However, a reflex trigger increases the cost of a VCR by an
additional 13,000 nuyen and +0.2
Essence. Additionally, reflex triggers
cannot be retrofitted to VCRs;
* rigger must replace his
entire VCR with new cyberware containing the trigger.
RIGGING AND OTHER CYBERWARE
Because of the way VCRs
interact with the brain, certain types of cyberware don't
have the same effects during
rigging as they do during
normal physical actions, as
described below.
Intelligence Enhancers
Cyberware that enhances
Intelligence increases
Reaction indirectly as a result
3M
of the improved Intelligence attribute.
The only implants published to date that
meet these criteria are the cerebral
booster and encephalon (pp. 23, 49,
Shadowtech). Furthermore, the unique
nature of the encephalon enables riggers
to use Driving skillsofts without the need
for skillwires for the purposes of rigging.
Characters without encephalons cannot
use the skillsofts without skillwires.
Reflex Recorder Bioware
The reflex recorder bioware implant
normally enhances a character's Active
Skills (including Vehicle Skills). The
enhancement improves the functioning
of nerve pair clusters around the spinal
cord, but these nerve clusters are not
used when a rigger is jacked into the
vehicle. Therefore, reflex recorder
bioware has no effect on Driving Skill
when a character is controlling
* vehicle using a VCR.
Datajacks
The improved
datajacks in the
Shadowtech sourcebook
(p. 45) increase the rate of
information flow between
flesh and machine. Thus, an
improved datajack (Level 2
and higher) adds a bonus to
Perception Tests while rigging. For every level above
Level 1, an improved datajack adds one additional die to
Perception Tests (for example, a Level
* datajack adds 1 extra die, a Level
* jack adds 2 dice and so on).
Because of the way the VCR interacts with the brain, riggers have their
datajacks installed behind and below
their ears, next to the submandibular
glands, instead of at the temples as do
deckers. Characters who wish to be
both deckers and riggers without
suffering the penalties
described in Rigging versus
Decking, p. 16, must have
both a decker datajack and a
rigger datajack.
Move-by-Wire Systems
The move-by-wire system
(p. 39, Cybertechnology) works by inducing a continual state of quasi-epileptic seizure in a
character. A computer in the system channels the seizure into
motion whenever the brain tells the body to move. Consequently,
the move-by-wire system works in direct opposition to a VCR.
Each level of move-by-wire reduces the effective level of a
VCR by 1 (i.e. - 2 to Reaction and -1D6 to Initiative) and lowers a
character's Control Pool by 1. If a rigger's move-by-wire rating is
equal to or higher than his VCR rating, he receives no bonuses to
Reaction and Initiative while rigging, but he still benefits from the
Control Pool (assuming that the move-by-wire system has not
negated it).
Monkeywrench has a Level 3 VCR (+6 Reaction,
+3D6 Initiative) and a Control Pool of 10. If
Monkeywrench received a Level 1 move-by-wire system, it would reduce his rig enhancement to +4 Reaction
and +2D6 Initiative and would reduce her Control Pool
to 9. A Level 3 move-by-wire system would completely
negate any bonuses to Reaction and Initiative and leave
Monkeywrench with a Control Pool of 7 dice. A Level 4
move-by-wire would have no additional effect on
Monkey's Reaction or Initiative, but would reduce his
Control Pool to 6.
RIGGING AND CYBERMANCY
Cybermancy allows a character to possess more cyberware
than his Essence Attribute would normally permit. (For basic rules
governing cyberware and Essence, see p. 43, SRII. For basic
cybermancy rules, see p. 78, Cybertechnology.)
Most riggers shouldn't need to take enough cyberware to
make cybermancy necessary, unless they want to improve their
performance outside of vehicles. Riggers who choose cybermancy may experience a dangerous side effect during riggingincreased susceptibility to "getting lost in the details" (p. 82,
Cybertechnology).
Because riggers trade the neural sensations of their body for
that of a machine, they are likely to get lost within their machines
while rigging and forget that they are human. Consequently, a rigger's invoked memory stimulator, or IMS, will kick in far more frequently than that of a non-rigger cyberzombie.
Rigger-zombies get lost in the details whenever all roll results
are successes on a Perception Test with a modified Target Number
of 4 or more (instead of 5 or more). In addition, the IMS kicks in
after the player fails only two consecutive Willpower Tests to
escape this condition, rather than five consecutive failures.
MAINTENANCE AND OVERHEAD
Equipment is like contacts; if you don't take care of it, it won't
take care of you. Even under normal operation, vehicles require
periodic maintenance checks to stay running. Considering the
extreme pedal-to-the-metal paces that riggers put their vehicles
through, maintenance becomes especially important.
Note that the following maintenance rules are NOT the same
as the SOTA rules presented in the Shadowrun Companion (pp.
85-87). SOTA reflects the relative obsolescence of a machine
compared to the technology curve. The maintenance rules below
reflect real degradation caused by normal use.
Under the basic Shadowrun rules, maintenance-related
issues such as fuel, storage and scheduled services are covered by
* character's Lifestyle costs. However, under the Lifestyle descrip
tions in SRII (p. 189), most characters don't own or operate
vehicle unless they maintain a Middle or higher Lifestyle
Furthermore, the Lifestyle rules may not adequately reflect the
large numbers of sophisticated and modified drones and vehicle
that riggers may possess.
The overhead cost of a vehicle includes costs for routin
maintenance, fuel consumption and storage. To determine a vehi
cle's monthly overhead, first calculate the vehicle's cost value. The
cost value is equal to the vehicle's base nuyen value plus the
value of all of its accessories and modifications. (The base nuyer
value is the amount listed in the appropriate sourcebook, not the
final price the character paid for the vehicle, which is altered b
Availability and Street Index.) The costs for all vehicles previous !:
published in various Shadowrun sourcebooks appear in th
Vehicle List, beginning on page 148.
Next, calculate the total number of Stress Points (se
Standard Vehicle Operations, p. 25) that the vehicle has accu
mulated over the past month of game time. Individual gamemas
ters determine when vehicles incur Stress in their games.
The monthly overhead cost for a vehicle is equal to 1 percent
the vehicle's cost value (the cost value divided by 100), rounded up
plus ten times the Stress Points accumulated over the past month.
Cost Value + 100 + (Stress Points of past month x 10) =
Monthly Overhead
If desired, characters may pay for some or all overhead cost
with Good Karma instead of nuyen. This Karma expenditur
reflects the time and effort spent between adventures keeping th
vehicle up to snuff. In this case, each point of Good Karma cove
500 nuyen of overhead costs.
Josie Cruise owns four vehicles: a rigged and heavily modified Hughes Stallion, a rigged and modified
Leyland-Rover van, an unmodified Eurocar Westwind
2000, and an off-the-shelf Aztechnology GCR-23C
Crawler drone. During a month when those vehicles
incur no Stress Points, their overhead cost would be calculated as follows:

Vehicle	Cost Value	1 percent of Cost Value
Modified Hughes Stallion	500,000	5,000
Modified Leyland-Rover van	40,000	400
Eurocar Westwind 2000	100,000	1,000
Aztechnology GCR-23C Crawler drone	1,250	13
Total Overhead Cost = 6,413¥

THE RIGGER
Josie believes that any decent rigger should take
good care of the vehicles he uses, so she spends a considerable amount of time between runs keeping her
vehicles at prime operational readiness. Josie's player
spends 4 points of Good Karma on vehicle maintenance
this month, which reduces the overhead cost by 2,000
(4 x 500). That leaves her with a final overhead cost of
4,413 nuyen.
LIFESTYLE REDUCTIONS
Riggers who maintain a Middle or higher Lifestyle receive a
discount to overhead costs, because part of these Lifestyle levels
includes owning and maintaining a vehicle. Middle Lifestyle
reduces total monthly overhead costs by 200 nuyen. High
Lifestyle reduces total monthly overhead costs by 1,500 nuyen,
and a Luxury Lifestyle reduces total monthly overhead costs by
3.000 nuyen. Characters may distribute Lifestyle discounts among
their different vehicles as they see fit.
Josie Cruise normally lives a Middle Lifestyle.
Because Middle Lifestyle grants a 200-nuyen credit to
overhead costs, her monthly overhead drops from 6,413
to 6,213 nuyen before applying any Karma.
After a successful run retrieving a rare tropical
flower from the jungles of Amazonia, Josie's bonus
allows her to boost her Lifestyle to Luxury level for six
months. During those six months, Josie receives a 3,000nuyen discount to her overhead costs, so her monthly
overhead falls to 3,413 nuyen before spending Karma.
Neglecting Overhead
If a character neglects to pay his monthly overhead upkeep
costs, wear and tear degrades his vehicles. For every month the
overhead cost of a vehicle is not paid, the vehicle accumulates 1
Stress Point.
However, a character can restore Stress Points lost in this
manner during subsequent months. To do so, the character must
pay the overhead cost for the missed month in addition to the
cost for the current month, spend 1 point of Good Karma and
make a successful Vehicle Build/Repair (4) Test. Success restores 1
Stress Point lost due to unpaid overhead.
After an unresolved misunderstanding with the
UCAS Air Force over Seattle airspace, Josie Cruise is
forced to hide out for a month in the Council Lands while
the heat blows over. Because she left her Eurocar
Westwind in storage in a Tacoma long-term garage, she
is forced to skip maintenance on the sports car. As a
result, the Westwind gains 1 Stress Point by the end of
the time period.
When Josie gets back to the Seattle metroplex, she
will have to spend an extra 1,000 nuyen in overhead
costs and 1 point of Good Karma to make up for the
missed overhead. Additionally, she must make a Car B/R
(4) Test before she can remove 1 point from the car's
Stress Rating.
THE MECHANIC CONTACT
* mechanic is a special contact of particular importance to
rigger characters. Most shadowrunners use their contacts for two
purposes: obtaining information and getting equipment. Riggers
use their mechanic contacts for these two purposes, and also rely
on them to repair their vehicles and machines and install vehicle
modifications.
In Repairing Vehicles (p. 26) and Vehicle Customization (p.
118), the costs listed for repairing or modifying vehicles are
always preceded by the term "Parts Cost," because these costs
cover the purchase of required parts only. Characters must install
those parts themselves or find someone else to do so. Thus, riggers turn to shadow mechanics, unless the rigger has the wide
assortment of Build/Repair Skills needed to do the job.
If a rigger asks a mechanic to fix or modify her vehicle, the
mechanic is going to charge her for labor. Hey, mechanics are
people too, and they need nuyen to buy food, pay rent, connect
to the Matrix and so on.
The going rate for shadow mechanics is 100 nuyen per work
hour (modified by the Lifestyle percentage, if playing a campaign
in a city other than Seattle). If this rate sounds somewhat high,
keep in mind that the mechanic is doing extra service in consideration for his client of dubious legal standing (like not registering
vehicle weapons, forgetting to log in work hours with the garage
management, forging names and SINs for requisition orders and
so on). Mechanics will work eight hours a day, five days a week.
Any overtime beyond that is charged at time and a half or more.
Also keep in mind that this rate is for Level 1 contacts and
Friends of a Friend, to whom the character must also pay the initial
contact fee, as well as labor charges. (See pp. 62-65, SRComp, for
more information on Contact Levels and Friends of Friends.)
Higher-level contacts will offer their services at reduced rates.
* Level 2 mechanic contact will charge the market labor rate
(50 nuyen an hour) and waive the overtime surcharge, provided
that the job doesn't impact too much on his free time (for example, don't ask him to give up his Friday nights or to wake up early
on Saturday or Sunday morning).
* Level 3 mechanic will not only waive overtime, he'll also
charge his buddy a discounted rate (25 nuyen an hour).
Additionally, if the character has been really good to the mechanic (above and beyond the call of Level 3 contact upkeep) and the
vehicle work will take only a day or two, the mechanic will do the
job for free. (Gamemasters should grant this favor only if rigger
players have been good with their roleplaying.)
STANDARD VEHICLE OPERATIONS
This section provides rules for all non-combat vehicle operations. (All you newbies out
there should note that drones are considered vehicles, so the following rules also apply to
directly and remotely controlled drones performing non-combat operations.) All rules provided in this chapter supersede previous vehicle rules published in Shadowrun, Second
Edition and the Rigger Black Book.
THE DRIVING TEST
For convenience, simply assume that characters can automatically accomplish basic vehicle maneuvers, such as driving to the local Stuffer Shack or taking the old helicopter for a little sightseeing hop. Any time a character attempts a difficult maneuver, however-such as
negotiating a hairpin turn at 100 kph or jumping a Yamaha Rapier over four lanes of rush-hour
traffic-the character must make a Driving Test to determine whether he successfully accomplishes the task.
The Driving Test is a Complex Action. (See Vehicle Combat, p. 45 for rules on actions
that riggers can take during a Combat Turn.)
To make a Driving Test, the player character uses his most appropriate Vehicle Skill. In addition, the player can add a number of dice equal to the vehicle's Autonav Rating (every autonav
system contains collision-avoidance and defensive-driving programs). If the vehicle is rigged, the
character also can add a number of Control Pool dice equal to the character's skill rating.
The base target number for the test is the vehicle's Handling Rating. Modify the base target number with all appropriate modifiers from the Driving Test Modifiers Table to determine
the final target number.

DRIVING TEST MODIFIERS TABLE KEY
Unfamiliar vehicle: If a character is operating a type of vehicle that he does not regularly operate, the unfamiliar vehicle modifier applies. The gamemaster determines whether a character is
unfamiliar with a particular vehicle type.
Large/very large vehicle of type: If a character is operating a
vehicle that is heavier or larger than the average vehicle of its type,
the large/very large vehicle modifier applies. For example, the largevehicle modifier would apply if a character is using the Car Skill for a
Driving Test when driving a van. If the character were using the Car
Skill to operate a truck, the very-large-vehicle modifier would apply.
The gamemaster determines which modifier applies.
Weather conditions: Rain, snow, heavy winds and other common adverse weather results in Bad conditions. Hurricanes, blizzards, thunderstorms (for aircraft) and other severe weather (including storms caused by nature spirits) result in Terrible conditions.
Terrain: The terrain modifier reflects the type of terrain in
which the character is operating the vehicle, according to the following terrain definitions. Open terrain refers to flat areas without
buildings, trees, or other significant features; this type of terrain
Includes highways. Open terrain for aircraft is cloudless skies, and
for boats, smooth water. Normal terrain refers to typical countryside and winding roads that offer only a few obstacles. Normal
terrain for aircraft is partly cloudy skies, and for boats, light seas.
Restricted terrain refere to suburban strante, light, winnde, billy
areas and so on. Fog, rain or total darkness can change Normal
terrain to Restricted. Restricted terrain for aircraft is overcast skies
and rain, and for boats, high seas. Tight terrain refers to urban
mazes, badlands and dense woods. Mist, glare or low light
changes Restricted terrain to Tight, and smoke, heavy fog or total
darkness change Normal terrain to Tight. Tight terrain for aircraft
and boats is high winds.
See page 35 for definitions of terrain for air-cushion vehicles
(hovercraft).
Actions performed during combat: This modifier applies if
the character is performing a standard vehicle action (such as
landing an aircraft, stopping a car at a certain location and so on)
under gunfire or in a combat situation. Note that a successful
Driving Test does not guarantee that the vehicle evades weapons
fire while performing the action. In addition, Control Pool dice
allocated for the Driving Test cannot be used for resisting damage
and vice versa.
This modifier does not apply if the vehicle is performing vehicle combat actions (see p. 45).
Non-rigger driving using a datajack: This modifier applies if
the character is driving using a datajack but does not have vehicle
control rig cyberware. Likewise, the modifier applies if a rigger is
driving a vehicle not adapted for rigger control. Control Pool dice
are not available if the vehicle is not rigged.
Rigger in control: The rigger-in-control modifier applies if the
character has VCR cyberware and the vehicle is adapted for rigger
control. In this case, reduce the target number by an amount
equal to twice the VCR Rating.
Whiz Kid is a rigger and has a Rating 1 vehicle control rig. He's also into aircraft, helos to be exact, and he's
got a Rotor Skill of 4 and a Fixed-Rotor Concentration of
6. That means he can operate any fixed-rotor aircraftwhether jacked in, via remote or by manual control-at
* skill rating of 6.
When Whiz Kid's Ares Dragon helicopter (Handling
5, Autonav 2) hits a sudden squall, he decides to land
before the weather gets worse. Based on the conditions,
the gamemaster decides that Whiz Kid needs to make a
Driving Test to land the chopper.
The target number for the test would be calculated
as follows:
Base Target Number = vehicle's
Handling Rating	5
Unfamiliar vehicle (Whiz has never flown
* Dragon before)	+1
Non-stressful situation (trying to land)	-1
Large vehicle (the Ares Dragon is big)	+2
Bad conditions (the squall)	+2
Rigger in control (VCR Rating 1)	-2
Final Target Number	8
Whiz Kid uses 8 dice for the test (6 for his decides not to add any Control Pool dice, because he's
saving those for picking up his teammates from a combat zone once the squall blows over.
The Driving Test produces the following results: 1,
2, 3, 3, 5, 6, 6 and 6. Re-rolling the three sixes, he gets
* 1, 1 and 4, for a final result of 1, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 7 and 10.
The last die saves his butt, because it gives him one success. Whiz Kid puts the Dragon down safely.
OD VEHICLE OPERATIONS
VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
The following definitions of the Shadowrun vehicle attributes
replace the previously published definitions (p. 104, SRII). Note that
not all attributes apply to all vehicle types; those attributes that apply
only to certain vehicle types are noted as such in the description.
Unless otherwise noted, all the rules mentioned in these
descriptions apply to both rigger and non-rigger characters.
For a complete list of vehicles, see the Vehicles List, p. 148.
HANDLING
Handling refers to the maneuverability of a vehicle and how
easily a character can control it. The higher the rating, the more
difficult a vehicle is to control.
The Handling Rating functions as the base target number for
all Driving Tests that use a Vehicle Skill. Most ground vehicles
have two separate Handling Ratings: the first represents the vehicle's Handling Rating on a road, while the second represents its
Handling in off-road terrain.
Whenever ground vehicles are traveling across anything
other than a paved surface, they are considered to be traveling in
off-road terrain. Off-road terrain is a subcategory of the standard
terrain types (Open, Normal, Restricted and Tight).
Any ground vehicle moving in off-road terrain reduces its
Speed Rating by half, unless the vehicle possesses off-road suspension (see Vehicle Design, p. 125).
SPEED
The Speed Rating represents the maximum safe Speed at
which a vehicle can travel for a sustained distance. This speed is
expressed as meters per Combat Turn.
Fixed-wing aircraft have two Speed Ratings. The lower rating
represents the aircraft's stall speed, the minimum speed the aircraft must maintain to keep flying.
To convert a vehicle's Speed Rating from meters/Combat
Turn into kilometers per hour, multiply the rating by 1.2. To convert a Speed Rating to miles per hour, multiply the rating by 0.75.
Exceeding the Speed Rating
Vehicles may exceed their Speed Ratings by up to 1.5 times
the rating, but doing so creates extra wear and tear on the vehicle that can increase the chance of spontaneous system failures.
(See Stress, p. 25, for more information.)
ACCELERATION
The Acceleration Rating measures how quickly a vehicle can
increase its speed within a given period. This attribute is used
when vehicles are fleeing from or pursuing other vehicles during
vehicle combat. In such cases, a character can make a Driving Test
to boost his Speed. Each success generated on the test increases
the vehicle's Speed by its Acceleration Rating.
Chazz the Spazz is flying along on his BMW Blitzen
2050 trying to escape from some Lone Star goons chasing him. He's going along at 50 mpt (meters per turn),
but the goons are getting closer so he decides to accelerate (the Blitzen has an Acceleration Rating of 14).
Chazz generates 2 successes on his Driving Test, which
provides him with a Speed Rating increase of 28. That
means the Blitzen accelerates from 50 mpt to 78 mpt as
it enters the next Combat Phase.
Decelerating
According to the way things work in the real world, objects
take a certain amount of time to stop moving, based on their
speed and mass. A vehicle can brake or otherwise decelerate safely as long as the vehicle's deceleration within a single Combat
Turn does not exceed its Acceleration Rating multiplied by 4.
If the vehicle's rate of deceleration exceeds this limit, the
controlling character must make a Body Resistance Test. The base
target number for the test is 3. For every 20 meters per turn (or
portion thereof) by which the vehicle exceeds the safe deceleration limit, increase the target number by 1.
For every two dice results that do not exceed the target number, increase the vehicle's Stress by 1. On a roll of all 1s, the driver loses control in a skid and must make a Crash Test (see p. 51).
For more information on Body Resistance Tests, see Vehicle
Damage, p. 49.
Chazz the Spazz is whizzing along at 78 mpt when
the gamemaster tells him that the bridge directly ahead
of him is out.
Chazz slams on the brakes. The Blitzen has a safe
deceleration limit of 56 mpt (Acceleration Rating 14
multiplied by 4), so if he stays within that limit the
Blitzen will still be traveling at 22 mpt when it hits the
space where the bridge used to be.
* fall from the bridge would hurt much more than
any damage that some hard braking will do to the bike,
so Chazz decides to decelerate to 0 mpt. That requires a
Body Resistance Test, which Chazz makes against a
Target Number of 5 (base Target Number 3 plus 2
because the Blitzen is traveling 22 mpt above its safe
deceleration limit).
BODY
* vehicle's Body Rating represents its mass and measures
how much punishment it can take, whether from weapons fire or
just plain hard driving. The Body Ratings Table lists Body Ratings
for vehicles of various types and weights. For rules on using the
Body Rating in game play, see Vehicle Damage, page 49.
Body Rating and Weapon Mounts
* vehicle's Body Rating also indicates how many weapons
can be mounted on the vehicle. Every hardpoint mount installed
on the vehicle takes up 2 Body Rating points. Every firmpoint
installed on the vehicle takes up 1 point.
For example, a vehicle with a Body Rating 3 can have a single hardpoint mount and a single firmpoint mount or it can have
* firmpoints. For more information on weapon mounts, see
Vehicle Weapon Mounts, page 131.

AUTONAV
The Autonav Rating represents the vehicle's collision-detection and navigation system. This rating replaces the Autopilot Rating.
During game play, a vehicle's Autonav Rating provides extra dice a character can add to Driving Tests made while performing only non-combat maneuvers.
* vehicle's autonav system actually impedes
Damage Reduction
The very nature of a vehicle reduces the damage level of all
weapons attacks by one level (except for those weapons firing
munitions specifically designated as anti-vehicle munitions). For
example, an attack from an Ares Predator (Moderate damage)
would be reduced to Light damage. This means weapons that inflict
only Light damage cannot affect vehicles. For more information, see
Vehicle Damage from Weapons, p. 53.
ARMOR
Armor is the rating for a complete composite armor that provides protection to the vehicle against all weapons fire (see
Vehicle Combat, p. 53).
Vehicle armor works in two distinct ways. First, the Armor
Rating functions as the Barrier Rating of the vehicle. This means
that the armor of a vehicle can absorb an amount of damage from
* weapon's unmodified Power equal to the Armor Rating. For
example, if a vehicle has an Armor Rating of 6, no weapon with a
Power Rating of 6 or lower could penetrate it; firing at the vehicle
with a Uzi III (6M damage) gets you a bunch of sparks for your
effort and no actual effect.
Against fire from a weapon with a Power Rating that exceeds
the armor's rating, the armor acts like standard ballistic or impact
armor and reduces the Power of the attack. For example, armor
with a rating of 6 will reduce the Power of fire from an Ares
Predator (9M) to 3M.
Vehicle armor provides no protection against impact damage from collisions. (See the explanation of Body in Vehicle
Damage, p. 49.)
SIGNATURE
Signature indicates a vehicle's vulnerability to electromagnetic or thermal detection and serves as the target number for
sensor and missile to-hit tests made against the vehicle.
Signature, however, does not represent the vehicle's vulnerability to target designators, such as laser and microwave targeting devices (see p. 60, Fields of Fire). Characters use standard
the controlling character's ability to perform combat maneuvers.
(See Vehicle Actions, p. 45.)
Note that the autonav system merely serves as a driver's
assistant. It can make minor control adjustments to avoid collisions and navigate a course, but it cannot perform any other
autonomous control functions.
PILOT
The Pilot Rating indicates a drone or robot's autonomous
decision-making capability (more commonly known as the "dog
brain"). Drones with high Pilot Ratings can "understand" and execute more complex commands than those with lower ratings.
* drone's Pilot Rating applies when no rigger is controlling
the drone. In such circumstances, the drone's Pilot Rating is substituted for the rigger's relevant skill for any required test.
For more information, see Issuing Commands, p. 66 in
Drones.
SENSOR
* vehicle's Sensor Rating determines the base number of
dice used in the vehicle's Perception Tests. The Sensor Rating may
also add dice to Gunnery Tests for attacks with certain types of
vehicle weapons (see Sensor Enhanced Gunnery, p. 58).
The Sensor Rating represents the vehicle's target-detection
(knowing a target exists), target-identification (knowing what the
target is), and targeting systems (locking weapons on to a target),
as well as the vehicle's radio transponders for position-locating
systems such as GPS or ALI.
If a vehicle has an autonavigation system (an Autonav Rating),
it automatically has a Sensor Rating of 0 or higher. Currently, no
Shadowrun vehicles without autonav are equipped with sensor systems, so a vehicle without autonav has no Sensor Rating.
CARGO FACTOR
* vehicle's Cargo Factor (CF) indicates how much space is available in the vehicle for cargo such as baggage, vehicle modifications or other material.
31-45 tons	8
46-60 tons	9
60+ tons	10+
Vans and light trucks, small yachts (30-40 feet), standard helicopters Medium and heavy trucks, large yachts (more than 40 feet), Lear jets and twin-engine airplanes

ABD VEHICLE OPERATIONS
One point of CF is equivalent to a cube of space one half
meter long on each side (0.125 cubic meters).
* vehicle's CF limits the types and ratings of certain modifications (such as vehicle armor and weapons) that can be added to
* vehicle. See Weight and Space Restrictions, p. 118, for more information.
LOAD
Load represents the amount of cargo weight a vehicle can
lift, pull or carry. Load does not include passengers, except for in
unusual circumstances (such as sasquatches or the troll-variant
giants described on page 41 of the Shadowrun Companion).
* vehicle's Load limits the types and ratings of certain vehicle modifications (such as vehicle armor and weapons) that can be
added to a vehicle. See Weight and Space Restrictions, p. 118,
for more information.
SEATING
The Seating code denotes the seating capacity of a vehicle.
The order of numerals in the Seating code indicates the arrangement of seats in the vehicle. For example, a Seating code of "2
bucket + 2 bucket + 2 bench" indicates that the front of the vehicle contains two bucket seats, the middle contains two bucket
seats and the back of the vehicle contains two bench seats.
ENTRY POINTS
Similarly, the Entry points code of a vehicle indicates the
number and arrangement of entry/exit points in the standard
model of the vehicle. An Entry point code of "2 + 1" indicates two
access points in the front or top of the vehicle and one access
point in the rear or bottom of the vehicle.
FUEL
* vehicle's Fuel code describes the type of fuel the vehicle
uses and the size of its fuel tank. A two-part Fuel code that lists
two fuel types and two tank capacities indicates that a vehicle
uses two different fuel sources. In such cases, the first fuel type
listed is the vehicle's primary fuel.
For information on Fuel rules, see Vehicle Design and
Customization, page 112.
SET-UP/BREAKDOWN TIME
Set-Up/Breakdown Time is the time needed to configure a
drone for operation and break the drone down for storage. One
Combat Turn must be spent activating a drone after it has been
configured, regardless of the drone's Setup/Breakdown Time.
LANDING/TAKEOFF (L/T) PROFILE
* fixed-wing aircraft's Landing/Takeoff Profile describes the
minimum runway distance the aircraft needs to take off and land.
Landing/Takeoff Profiles are divided into four categories: Normal,
STOL (Short Takeoff/Landing), VSTOL (Very
Short
Takeoff/Landing), and VTOL (Vertical Takeoff/Landing). See
Aircraft, page 36, for more information.
ECONOMY
Economy indicates how far a vehicle can travel on a given
amount of fuel. Drones have a subrating under the Economy
heading, called Idle Economy. This rating reflects how much fuel
* drone consumes during a given period while idling in position.
For more information on Economy, see Variable Fuel
Consumption, p. 81.
SPECIAL VEHICLE ATTRIBUTES
The following vehicle characteristics apply to vehicle operations, but do not appear in the standard vehicle statistic profiles.
ED/ECD
* vehicle's electronic-deception (ED) systems emit signals
that fool sensors into misjudging the position, speed, heading or
characteristics of the vehicle. ED increases the Signature of the
vehicle for Sensor and Gunnery Tests made against it, but detecting ED is much more difficult than detecting ECM.
* vehicle's electronic counter-deception (ECD) systems consist of reality-checking electronic circuitry that counters the subtle
signals of ED. ECD counteracts the modifiers imposed by ED.
For more information on the use of ED and ECD, see Sensors,
page 32.
ECM/ECCM
Electronic countermeasures (ECM) systems "attack" remotecontrol networks by jamming their frequencies and degrading the
quality of their transmission signals. However, a vehicle's ECM
systems increase its Signature for certain Gunnery Tests made
against the vehicle.
Electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM) systems counteract the effects of ECM systems for the purposes of Gunnery
Tests. A drone may also use ECCM to reduce the Power of ECM
jamming attempts made against it.
See Sensors, page 31, for more information on ECM and
ECCM systems.
FLUX
* vehicle's Flux Rating represents the raw electrical power
available for its remote control decks, sensors and electronic warfare systems.
The Flux Rating determines the effective range of each system, as well as the number of dice used to resist electronic warfare effects.
LEARNING POOL
The Learning Pool provides robots with dice they can use
when performing actions on their own. For more information, see
Robots, page 67.
MANEUVER SCORE
The Maneuver Score is a variable rating used during vehicle
combat. It reflects the abstract tactical position a vehicle occupies
in relation to other vehicles and is based on the following factors:
the vehicle type, its current speed, terrain and the results of an
open-ended Success Test made by the driver.
STANDARD VEHICLE OPERATION
THRU
For more information, see The Maneuver Score, page 41.
STRESS
The Stress Rating is used to simulate the effects of wear and
tear on vehicles. Each time a character pushes a vehicle beyond its
normal performance capabilities or loses control of a vehicle, the
vehicle's Stress Rating increases. And each time the Stress Rating
of a vehicle increases, the chances of spontaneous vehicle breakdowns or system failures increase.
INCURRING STRESS
All new vehicles start with a Stress Rating of O. (If a character
obtains a used vehicle, it may have a higher Stress Rating. The
gamemaster determines the exact rating.)
* character's vehicle may incur Stress Points in two ways.
First, the character may intentionally push the vehicle beyond its
normal performance capabilities by pushing the vehicle beyond
its normal Speed Rating or using extra dice for Driving Tests.
Second, a vehicle may incur Stress if its driver fails a Driving Test
according to the parameters of the Stress Rule of One, as
described on page 26.
Breaking the Speed Limit
* vehicle's Speed Rating indicates the maximum sustained
speed the vehicle can handle without incurring damage. An
aggressive driver can coax a vehicle up to 1.5 times its Speed
Rating, but any time a vehicle exceeds its Speed Rating, it incurs
* Stress Point.
VEHICLE OPERATIONS
Extra Dice for Driving Tests
* character can improve his chances of success on any .
Driving Test by adding extra dice to his roll in exchange for intentionally incurring Stress Points. For every 2 Stress Points, the character may add 1 additional die to his Driving Test.
For vehicles with Body Ratings of 1, controlling characters can
intentionally inflict 2 Stress Points for 1 additional die.
For all other vehicles, the number of Stress Points intentionally inflicted during a single action may not exceed the vehicle's
Body Rating.
Stress Rule of One
Any time a character really botches a Driving Test, his vehicle
may incur Stress Points. A vehicle incurs 1D6 Stress Points whenever the number of 1s rolled on a Driving Test equals or exceeds
the driver's Vehicle Skill.
STRESS AND SYSTEM FAILURES
Stress may cause vehicle system failures in three circumstances.
First, system failure may result whenever a vehicle incurs
Stress from the Stress Rule of One. If the vehicle's Stress Rating
increases to twice the vehicle's Body Rating or greater, one major
vehicle system (brakes, steering, transmission and so on) automatically fails. The gamemaster chooses the system that breaks
down. The character must make a Crash Test to avoid crashing.
(See Crashing, p. 51.)
System failure may also occur whenever a driver fails a
Driving Test. In this case, the gamemaster makes a Stress Test for
the vehicle by rolling 2D6 against the vehicle's Stress Rating. If the
result is less than the vehicle's Stress Rating, one major vehicle
system suddenly fails, and the driver must make a Crash Test to
avoid crashing.
Furthermore, the gamemaster may call for a Stress Test any
time the vehicle is running.
While running from the local corporate heat, Rigger
* tries to negotiate a hairpin turn down a narrow alley.
Rigger X has no Control Pool dice available for the
required Driving Test, so he decides to gain some extra
dice by intentionally inflicting Stress Points on his
Eurocar Westwind. The Westwind has a Body Rating 3,
so Rigger X can inflict only 2 Stress Points, which gains
him only 1 additional die.
Rigger X's player rolls the dice and fails the Driving
Test. The gamemaster makes the required Stress Test
and produces a result of 4. That result is lower than the
Westwind's Stress Rating of 2, so the Stress Test produces no effect.
However, Rigger X's failed Driving Test produced
five 1s, which equals his Car Skill of 5, so the Stress Rule
of One applies. The gamemaster rolls 1D6 and generates
* result of 4, which increases the Westwind's Stress
Rating to 6. The new rating of 6 is equal to twice the
Westwind's Body Rating of 3, so the sports car automatically suffers a system failure.
The gamemaster decides that one of the
Westwind's tires blows out as the car makes the hairpin
turn, and Rigger X must now make a Crash Test to keep
the sports car from slamming into the alley wall.
Reducing Stress
* vehicle's Stress Rating may be reduced only through a
thorough maintenance overhaul in a Vehicle Facility (see pp. 244,
259 in SRII).
To perform a maintenance overhaul, the vehicle's controlling
character makes a Build/Repair Test against a target number equal
to the vehicle's Stress Rating plus 4. Every two successes reduce
the Stress Rating by 1. The Stress Rating cannot be reduced lower
than 1-once you push a vehicle beyond its limits, it never performs as well as it did before.
* maintenance overhaul costs 50 nuyen in replacement parts
for each Stress Point removed, plus labor costs, if the work was
performed by a mechanic.
REPAIRING VEHICLES
Repairing vehicles is a two-step process that consists of a
Vehicle Build/Repair Test and buying any needed replacement parts.
The target number for the Vehicle Build/Repair Test is the
number of damage boxes on the vehicle's Condition Monitor
which the character wishes to repair, plus 2. The base time for
repair is 16 hours per box of vehicle damage. After making the
test, divide the base time by the number of successes. The result
is the amount of repair time required to repair the damage.
To determine the cost of replacement parts, multiply the
number of damage boxes by 5. The resulting figure is the parts
cost, expressed as a percentage of the total vehicle cost (including modifications). For example, the parts cost for a vehicle with
the Light damage box filled on its Condition Monitor would be 5
percent of the vehicle's total cost (multiply the cost times .05).
Replacement parts have the same Availability Codes and
Street Indexes as the vehicle under repair. 'Characters use their
Vehicle Build/Repair Skills to make Acquisition Tests to obtain
parts. Repairs cannot start until the parts show up, so the characters have to wait the full Availability time before commencing with
repairs.
Once the character/mechanic obtains the parts, repair work
gets underway. Repair work takes the full repair time (as determined by the initial Vehicle B/R Test), During this time the vehicle
is completely unavailable for use. If, for some reason, the character needs the vehicle back, the mechanic must spend an additional hour putting the vehicle back together and returning it to
some kind of operational condition. (This hour does not count
toward the repair time). Once the character is done using the
vehicle and returns it for repair, the repair time resumes at the
point it left off.
SENSORS
Sensors are the primary-heck, the only method a rigger has of perceiving the world
beyond her vehicle. She uses them to see, hear and feel; through them, she is aware of and
can identify various elements in the environment surrounding the vehicle, from the pedestrian at the crosswalk to the security guard on patrol to the cop car screaming down the street.
* rigger can use sensors to identify and attack targets kilometers away, visually monitor two
different locations at the same time, or catch a crooked corp operator on chip.
* vehicle's Sensor Rating measures the overall capability of a vehicle's sensors to detect
other objects. The rating determines how many dice the vehicle's controlling player may use
for Sensor Tests and also the components included in the vehicle's sensor systems.
SYSTEM COMPONENTS AND SENSOR RATINGS
Sensor systems include numerous components, depending on the overall Sensor Rating.
Rating O sensors include rangefinders and ultrasound and laser proximity detectors. Rating 1
sensors include proximity detectors, rangefinders, video (but not trideo) cameras, basic radar,
signature-recognition software and low-light and telescopic magnification. Sensors rated 2, 3
and 4 include all of those components plus thermographic imaging. And Rating 5 or higher
sensors include all components previously mentioned plus flare compensation.
All sensors include magnification power equal to 50 times the sensor rating.
ADDING/UPGRADING COMPONENTS
Sometimes a character may want to upgrade or add a specific sensor component (for
example, installing flare-compensation sensors to a Rating 4 or lower sensor system, or boosting a sensor system's telescopic magnification).
The parts cost for such upgrades is equal to the original cost of the sensors times . 10, multiplied by the number of levels the player intends to boost the system for the upgrade. Sensor
costs appear in Vehicle Design and Customization on page 140.
SENSORS
Skyrie needs to add 100x magnification capacity to
her spotter drone's Level 1 sensors. Skyrie's a little short
of cash right now, so she decides to upgrade only the
magnification rather than the entire sensor system.
The base price of the spotter's Level 2 sensors is 15,000
nuyen. Skyrie wants to boost the vision-magnification
subsystem by 2 levels, so the cost of the upgrade is
3,000 nuyen (15,000 x .10 = 1,500; 1,500 x 2 = 3,000).
IMAGE TRANSMISSIONS
All Level 1 and higher sensor systems can transmit and
record audiovisual footage. Footage can be stored as datafiles
(which requires onboard memory or a computer), recorded on
chips (which requires a video-recording unit) or transmitted to a
remote station (which requires a remote-control linkup). Onboard
computers and video recorders must be hooked into electronics
ports (see Electronics Port, p. 139).
Audio/video clips take up 2 megapulses of memory per
minute of recording. Audio-only or video-only recordings consume 1 megapulse per minute. Recorded footage may be
enlarged up to Sensor Rating x 20 magnification before the chip
image loses image quality. Note that sensor systems transmit in
two-dimensional video images, not trideo images.
Ace, a shadowsnoop reporter, has hired a rigger to
conduct surveillance on Mr. Bigg, a crooked politico Ace
hopes to expose in a big story. Ace's rigger uses a rotodrone with Level 2 sensors and an onboard palmtopsized microcomputer unit to monitor Bigg through a
hotel window.
Ace wants both audio and video proof, and the
microcomputer unit has 150 Mp of memory. Each
minute of audio/video footage consumes 2 megapulses
of memory, so the microcomputer can record up to 75
minutes of audiovisual footage.
Several hours later, Ace meets with the rigger to
see what he's captured. While reviewing the footage,
Ace notices a small object lying atop the dresser in
Bigg's room. He enlarges the video. The maximum
enlargement Ace can get of the object is 40x the size of
the image before the image loses quality.
Now, had Ace been with the rigger and noticed the
object during real-time surveillance, the rigger could
have used the sensors' 50x magnification power. That
would have enabled Ace to reveal the 500,000¥ bribe
on Mr. Bigg's cred reader-which just goes to prove that
reporters who don't slog through stakeouts miss out on
the big stories.
Gamemasters running media campaigns (see p. 114, SRComp)
should note that vehicle sensor systems were originally designed
for purposes other than news reporting. Consequently, footage
obtained from sensor feeds tends to be less sharp than footage
recorded on high-resolution portacams. Therefore, sensor footage
used in Perception Tests adds a +1 target modifier to the test.
SENSOR TESTS
To determine if a vehicle's sensors detect another vehicle or
object within the sensor's range, the controlling player makes a
Sensor Test. (See Sensor and Remote Deck Ranges, p. 30, for
rules on determining sensor ranges.) The vehicle's Sensor Rating
determines how many dice the player may use for the test.
The target vehicle's Signature is the base target number for
the test. Apply any appropriate modifiers from the Sensor Test
Modifiers Table.
The number of successes achieved on the test determines what information the Sensor Test produces, as described in the Sensor Test Results Table.

SENSOR TEST MODIFIERS TABLE

SENSOR TEST MODIFIERS TABLE KEY
Direct LOS: LOS stands for line of sight. This modifier applies if an uninterrupted line of sight exists between the vehicle's sensors and the target objects.
Urban Setting: The Urban Setting modifier applies if the sensor or the target is located inside a built-up urban area. The modifier reflects the noise, heat and electromagnetic distortion that can hinder detection.
Fog/Smog/Precipitation: The presence of natural fog, smog
or precipitation increases the difficulty of detecting objects.
Restricted Terrain: If the sensing vehicle or target is navigating through Restricted Terrain, detecting becomes more difficult.
Concealed by Spirit: If a nature spirit is concealing the target
using the Concealment power, the target number increases by an
amount equal to the spirit's Force Rating.
Tight Terrain: The Tight Terrain modifier applies if the sensor
or target is traveling through Tight Terrain. The modifier reflects
that fact that solid objects hinder sensor readings.
Sensing Vehicle Damaged: The Sensing Vehicle Damaged
modifier applies if the sensing vehicle has suffered damage. The
target number modifier is equal to the vehicle's current Injury
Modifier as shown on the Damage Modifiers Table (SRII, p. 112).
SENSORS
SENSOR TEST RESULTS TABLE
Number of Successes Result
* No contact. The sensors do not detect the target.
* Basic contact. The sensors detect the target object and determine its distance, direction of travel and speed. The sensors also identify the target's general type (a building, an aircraft, a ground vehicle, a biological life form and so on) but cannot provide further identification.
* General contact. The sensors identify the target's general subtype (for example, a radar dish, a helicopter, a hovertank, a dragon and so on).
4+ Positive contact. The sensors identify the target's specific type (for example, a XQ-137 Air Search Radar, a Hughes WQ-2 Stallion, an M24 Stuart IFV, a feathered serpent and so on). The sensors identify features that distinguish the target from others of its type.

SENSOR AND REMOTE DECK RANGES
Unlike firing ranges for weapons, which extend outward in a
straight line, ranges for sensors and remote control decks work
more like radar. They cover a 360-degree area of effect with the
sensor or deck at the center.
The ranges of sensor systems and remote control decks are
determined by the power output of the system's transmitter. The
greater the transmitter power, the greater the system's effective
range. At the same time, however, a higher power output produces a higher signature and increases the vulnerability of a vehicle or remote control deck to detection.
The power output of a vehicle's sensor system or a remote
control deck is measured by the system's Flux Rating.
THE FLUX RATING
The Flux Rating (short for electromagnetic power flux) reflects
the power output of transmitters used in communications gear,
remote control nets, sensors systems, jammers, ECM and ED.
The Flux Rating Table shows the Flux Ratings for most electronic devices. The Flux Rating can be increased or decreased to
boost the signal strength of a transmitter or decrease the electronic signature it produces.

Changing Flux Ratings
Any electronic device can operate at a lower Flux Rating than
its standard rating, down to a minimum of 0. Increasing the Flux
Rating to greater than the default value, however, requires external modifications.
Electronic devices that are connected to a vehicle via an electronics port (see Electronics Port, p. 139) may draw extra electrical power from the vehicle's engine to boost their Flux Ratings.
The maximum number of points a device's Flux Rating can be
raised in this manner is equal to half the vehicle's Body Rating,
rounded down.
* vehicle engine can provide boosts to multiple devices, but
the total Flux Points of all simultaneous boosts may not exceed the
vehicle's Body Rating.
Vehicle electronic devices may also draw extra Flux Points from
signal amplifiers mounted on the vehicle. The rating of an amplifier
determines how many Flux Points the amplifier can provide.
Josie Cruise likes to use her van, Rough Rider, as a
command-and-control center. The van is outfitted with a
remote-control deck (Flux 2), a radio (Flux 3), a sensor
system (Flux 8) and ECM (Flux 2).
The van has a Body Rating of 4, so the van can provide no more than 4 Flux Points at any single time, and
it cannot boost any single system by more than 2 points.
For example, Josie could use the van to provide a 2point boost to the remote-control deck and 1-point
increases to the van's sensor system and ECM. However,
she could not provide 2-point boosts to all four systems.
In addition to computing effective ranges for sensors, communications gear and certain other electronic devices, Flux
Ratings are also used when resolving electronic warfare (see
Electronic Warfare, p. 68).
FLUX RATING AND RANGE
The range for any electronic transmitter (communications
gear, remote control equipment, sensors, ECM and ED) is based
on the transmitter's Flux Rating, as shown on the Flux Rating and
Range Table.
SENSORS

Situational Range Modifiers
External circumstances can temporarily increase or decrease
the range created by a standard Flux Rating. The modifiers in the
Situational Range Modifiers Table are applied to a transmitter's
Flux Rating before the effective range of the transmitter is computed. After determining the modified Flux Rating, round the
result down to the nearest half, instead of to the nearest whole
number.
SITUATIONAL RANGE MODIFIERS TABLE
Condition	Modifier
High elevation	+4
ECCM in use	-ECCM + 2
Electrical storm	-2
Encryption in use	-0.5
Humid air	-0.5
Urban environment	-1

SITUATIONAL RANGE MODIFIERS TABLE KEY
High elevation refers to any situation in which an uninterrupted line of sight exists between the transmitter and its receiver or target. This modifier usually applies to aircraft in flight or land-based transmitters perched atop high elevations such as hills or skyscraper roofs.
ECCM in use refers to electronic counter-countermeasures,
which defeat ECM by filtering out electronic garbage and boostIng the signal strength of meaningful signals. Because ECCM also
draws electrical power from the transmitter, subtract half the
ECCM Level when determining the modified Flux Rating.
The electrical storm modifier applies whenever a thunderstorm or solar flares are active in the transmitter's area.
Encryption in use applies only to radios and remote control
decks that are operating under encryption. In these cases, reduce
the device's Flux Rating by half.
The humid air modifier is another environmental modifier. It
applies to any transmitter operating during a particularly hot,
humid and muggy day. This modifier may also apply to transmitters operating in areas that have an excessively high smog content (Los Angeles is a particularly good example). Do not use this modifier in conjunction with the electrical storm modifier.
The urban environment modifier applies to transmitters used
in heavily built-up areas, such as downtown districts, industrial
parks or any major non-residential area of a mega-sprawl. The
modifier also applies if the transmitter is within 1 kilometer of a
high-voltage power line.
Josie Cruise is using a CyberSpace Dalmatian recon
drone to conduct some long-range snooping. She's
operating the drone via a remote-control deck augmented with Rating 4 signal amplifiers (Flux 6, 12 km range),
located on the roof of a fourteen-story parking garage.
Josie's using a crypto-circuit encryption device on her
deck, as well as Level 3 ECCM (her target really hates
unwanted snoopers).
The effective Flux Rating for determining the range of her deck transmitter would be 8, calculated as follows.

Deck Flux Rating 6
High Elevation 4
Encryption -0.5
ECCM -1.5
Effective Flux Rating 8

This effective Flux Rating gives Josie's Dalmatian an 8-kilometer increase in range to 20 kilometers (see Flux Rating and Range Table).

ELECTRONIC COUNTERMEASURES (ECM)
Electronic countermeasures (ECM) generate a field of electromagnetic noise that jams radio and sensor electronic wave
bands. In game terms, ECM increases the difficulty of targeting
and locking on to an ECM-equipped vehicle. However, ECM does
not hinder the ability of individual characters to fire weapons
directly at a vehicle.
To determine the effectiveness of ECM, the targeted vehicle's
character and the jamming vehicle's character make an opposed
Success Test, known as an ECM Test. The jamming character rolls
* number of dice equal to the Flux Rating of his vehicle's ECM
suite; the test target number is equal to the Sensor Rating of the
opposing vehicle. The targeted vehicle's character rolls a number
of dice equal to the Flux Rating of his vehicle's sensors; the test
target number is equal to the ECM rating of the targeted vehicle.
If the targeted character wins the test, no jamming occurs
and the player can proceed with a Sensor Test. If the jamming
character wins, increase the Signature of his vehicle by the number of successes generated on his test.
The ECM Test represents the interaction of electronic devices.
Therefore, the test does not constitute an action by either character, and is performed outside of the Combat Turn sequence.
SENSORS
Turning ECM and ECCM on or off is considered a Simple Action.
If a single vehicle is attempting to use ECM, only the best die
roll result applies. The effects are not cumulative. If one jammer is
using its ECM against many different vehicles, make only one
ECM Test and compare the number of successes against the
Sensor Ratings of each of the other vehicles involved.
Riggers may use electronic counter-countermeasures (ECCM)
to counteract ECM jamming. To do so, the two players make an
opposed Success Test. The counterjammer rolls a number of dice
equal to his vehicle's ECCM Rating against a target number equal
to the ECM Rating of his opponent's vehicle. The jammer rolls a
number of dice equal to his vehicle's ECM Rating against a target
number equal to the ECCM Rating of his opponent's vehicle Each
success that the counterjammer generates negates 1 success generated by the jammer on his ECM Test.
M.C. Jammer is running a shipment of arms across
the border from San Angelo into Aztlan-occupied El
Paso. As he nears the border in his t-bird (Signature 4),
he turns on his ECM (Rating 3, Flux 10) because an
Aztlan Aguilar attack helicopter (Sensor 7, Flux 8) is closing in.
Jammer's player rolls 10 dice (the t-bird's Flux)
against a Target Number 7 (the copter's Sensor Rating)
and generates 4 successes. The gamemaster rolls 8 dice
(the copter's Flux) against a Target Number 3 (the tbird's ECM Rating) and generates 2 successes. Jammer
wins; the Signature Rating of the t-bird increases by 4, from 4 to 8.
In response to the cloud of snowy static surrounding his field of vision, the Aztlan pilot switches on his
ECCM (Rating 4) to counter the ECM. The gamemaster
rolls 4 dice (the copter's ECCM Rating) against a Target
Number 3 (Jammer's ECM Rating). Jammer's player rolls
* dice (ECM Rating) against a Target Number 4 (the
copter's ECCM Rating). This time, the gamemaster generates 3 successes, while M.C. Jammer gets 2. The
Aguilar's ECCM wins, and its single net success counters
one of M.C. Jammer's successes from his ECM Test and
reduces Jammer's Signature from 8 to 7.
ELECTRONIC DECEPTION (ED)
Electronic-deception (ED) systems produce subtle electromagnetic radiation which, when superimposed over sensor emissions, feed false or misleading signals to enemy sensors. For
example, ED can fool a sensor into thinking the target is flying at
* different speed or in another direction; additionally, ED can confound any attempts to identify the target by its Signature.
The ED optional rule is both a roleplaying device and a game
mechanic. Because ED increases the Signature of the target, characters may find themselves in situations in which they can see the
object that their sensors are misrepresenting. If a rigger suspects
* discrepancy between what he sees or knows and what his vehicle's sensors are telling him, the gamemaster can allow the rigger
to make a Perception Test against a target number equal to his
opponent's ED Rating plus 4. Success confirms or denies the rigger's suspicions.
In terms of game mechanics, the player controlling the EDequipped vehicle rolls a number of dice equal to the vehicle's ED
Rating against a target number equal to the opposing vehicle's
Sensor Rating (or the Intelligence Rating of a missile, if a missile
has been fired at the ED-equipped vehicle). Each test success
increases the ED-equipped vehicle's Signature by 1. ED systems
are area-effect systems, and their ranges depend on the Flux
Rating of the vehicle carrying them.
Electronic-counterdeception (ECD) systems use realitychecking measures, such as dead-reckoning navigation and
power-attenuation monitors, to negate the effects of ED systems.
Like its cousin ECCM, ECD affects specific vehicles rather than a
general area.
Activating or deactivating ED or ECD is considered a Simple Action.
To determine the effectiveness of ECD, the player rolls a
number of dice equal to his vehicle's ECD Rating against a target
number equal to the targeted vehicle's ED Rating. Each success on
the ECD Test negates one success from the ED Test. ECD does not
work against standard ECM.
Because ECD works by filtering out ED emissions, ECD drains
power from a vehicle's electronic transmitter, thus reducing the
effective ranges and resistance to jamming of the vehicle's sensors.
To reflect this, subtract the vehicle's ECD Rating from its Flux Rating.
Monkeywrench has been hired to capture the elusive rigger Mirage. For the past six hours he's camped
out by Gravelly Lake in Fort Lewis in his vehicle (Sensor
Rating 4), waiting for Mirage to pass overhead on her run
into Tacoma. As Mirage flies over in her helicopter
Shadowstorm (Signature 3, ED Rating 5), Mirage's player secretly rolls 5 dice against a Target Number 4 (the
Sensor Rating of Monkeywrench's vehicle). She scores 4
successes, which boosts the copter's Signature from 3 to
* (but the gamemaster doesn't tell, Monkeywrench's
player that).
Meanwhile, Monk picks up something through his
vehicle sensors. He makes a Sensor Test to try to identify the object. The Target Number for the test is 7 (the
helicopter's modified Signature, though the gamemaster
keeps that a secret from Monkeywrench). Monk's test
generates no successes, so his sensors detect only a
small flying object-much too small to be a copter.
Consequently, Monk goes back to watching the sky. He
doesn't realize he's been tricked until he sees Mirage's
copter flying past him.
If Monkeywrench had activated his vehicle's ECD,
his sensors might have correctly identified his elusive
quarry before it was too late.
SPECIAL VEHICLE OPERATIONS
The following rules are designed to resolve the use of unique or special vehicle operations, the use of special vehicle features such as mechanical arms and legs, and the use of
vehicles such as air-cushion vehicles.
LIFTING AND PULLING OBJECTS
Only vehicles or drones equipped with a crane, winch or boom can lift objects, but any
vehicle can pull an object along the ground, provided the object is attached to the vehicle
with a tow bar, cables or some other device.
* vehicle or drone can safely lift or pull any object whose weight does not exceed the
vehicle's Load Rating. Two or more vehicles can safely pull or lift a weight equal to the sum
of their Load Ratings.
VEHICLE PULL TESTS
Vehicle Pull Tests reflect a vehicle's capacity to lift or pull objects that weigh up to two
times the vehicle's Load Ratings for short distances (less than half a kilometer). For example,
use a Pull Test for such situations as a truck recovering a vehicle that is half buried in mud,
using a vehicle's winch to pull the vehicle up a particularly steep cliff, a tugboat trying to dislodge a barge marooned on a sandbar and so on.
* Vehicle Pull Test consists of a Body Test for the vehicle made against the appropriate
target number from the Pull Test Target Numbers/Modifiers Table. Players may also intentionally incur Stress Points to add extra dice for Pull Tests (see Stress, p. 25). If the Pull Test fails,
the vehicle fails to lift or pull the object. However, the vehicle still incurs Stress and suffers
other applicable side effects (see Pull Test Side Effects, p. 34).

PULL TEST TABLE KEY
Bad conditions: Muddy roads, moderate rolling slopes and
similar terrain constitute bad conditions for ground vehicles. In
addition, inclement weather, such as rain or snow, may create bad
conditions on level ground and dirt roads.
For aircraft, bad conditions include moderate cross winds,
snow, rain or other precipitation. For boats pulling barges or floating objects, bad conditions include rough, moderately choppy
waters.
Terrible conditions: Mud pits, quicksand, steep cliffs, marshes or flooded ground constitute terrible conditions for ground
vehicles. In addition, inclement weather can transform normally
bad conditions (see above) to terrible conditions. Severe weather,
such as blizzards, severe thunderstorms or weather whipped up
by a great nature spirit using its Storm power, can create terrible
conditions in any terrain.
Terrible conditions for aircraft include severe storms, galeforce winds or rushing vertical air drafts. For boats, terrible conditions consist of storm-tossed waves.
Object stuck in ground: This modifier applies if the object
being pulled or lifted is partially rooted or buried in the ground.
The gamemaster sets the exact value of the modifier, based on
how deeply the object is buried in the ground. For example, a Pull
Test made to free a truck that is axle deep in mud would receive
* +1 target modifier, while a test for a truck sunk halfway in soft
earth would receive a +4 modifier.
Pulling without rollers: This modifier applies when a ground
vehicle attempts to pull an object across the ground without some
sort of rolling support (such as wheels) under the object.
However, the gamemaster may waive this modifier if he judges
that the ground is slick enough for frictionless pulling (such as an
oil-covered or icy surface).
Vehicle braced in place: This modifier applies if a ground
vehicle is braced with posts or some other device that prevents it
from slipping. Bracing a vehicle or removing such braces takes 1
turn. Note that a braced vehicle is completely immobile.
PULL TEST SIDE EFFECTS
Though successful Pull Tests enable vehicles to lift or carry a
weight greater than their Load Ratings, the effort of doing so
reduces the vehicle's Speed Rating during the action and inflicts
Stress on the vehicle. These effects are described in the Pull Test
Side Effects Table.
In addition, any time a vehicle lifts or pulls a weight greater
than 1.5 times its Load Rating, the vehicle may incur an extra
Stress Point. In such cases, the controlling character must make a
Body (4) Test for the vehicle. If the test fails, the vehicle incurs 1
Stress Point in addition to any other Stress incurred during the test.
PULL TEST SIDE EFFECTS TABLE
Object Weight	Speed Reduction	Stress
Up to 1.5 x Load Rating	Half-speed	+1/hour
1.6 to 2 x Load Rating	Quarter speed	+1/minute

MECHANICAL ARMS AND LEGS
Some vehicles and many drones feature mechanical arms and legs. The following rules govern the use of vehicle appendages.
ARM TESTS
* successful Arm Test is required to perform any sort of articulate motion (such as picking up an object, turning a switch and
so on) with a vehicle's mechanical arm. The test target number is
the vehicle's Handling Rating. If a rigger is controlling the vehicle,
he may add a number of Control Pool dice to this test equal to the
rigger's Quickness Rating. If a drone is not directly controlled by
* rigger (see Drones, p. 65) use the drone's Pilot Rating in place
of the Quickness Rating.
The gamemaster may decrease the base target number for
simple tasks such as picking up a large object the arm can easily
grip, or he can increase it for difficult tasks such as defusing a
bomb with a drone's mechanical arm.
ARM SKILL TESTS
* character (or a drone's Pilot) may use a skill while using a
mechanical arm, for example, using the Demolitions Skill to
defuse a bomb with a mechanical arm. In such cases, a vehicle
with a high Handling Rating may make the Skill Test more difficult.
To reflect this, increase the Skill Test target number by 1 for
each point that the vehicle's Handling Rating exceeds 3. For
example, if the vehicle has a Handling Rating 4, add 1 to the Skill
Test target number. If the vehicle has a Handling Rating 5, add 2
and so on.
Sergeant York of the Seattle division of Lone Star is
trying to defuse a bomb found in the basement of the
Seattle Space Needle. He's using a bomb-defusing
drone (Handling 4), which is equipped with a set of
mechanical arms.

Normally, an Arm Test for the drone would use a
base Target Number 4, the same as its Handling Rating.
But the gamemaster decides that this operation is particularly tricky, so she raises the base Target Number to 5.
In addition, York is using his Demolitions 4 skill for
the test. The drone has a Handling Rating 4, so that adds
another 1-point increase to the target number, for a final
Target Number of 6.
York's player rolls 4 dice for the test and gets a 1, 2,
* and 5. The drone's arms just weren't articulate enough,
and the bomb detonates prematurely. The drone is toast
and the basement of the Needle is kinda beat up-but
York, who is holed up fifty meters away in an armored
van, is fine.
ARM MELEE ATTACKS
Characters may also use mechanical arms to make melee
attacks against other characters. The modifier for a high Handling
Rating also applies in this situation.
The effective Strength Rating for the test is equal to the vehicle's Body Rating multiplied by itself. Arms can be modified to
have higher Strength Ratings (see p. 145).
MECHANICAL LEGS
Vehicles or drones that use mechanical legs to propel themselves may walk or run using the standard rules for walking and
running (see p. 83, SRII). All modifiers that apply to walking or
running characters also apply
to walking or running vehicles.
Similarly, vehicles with legs
use the standard character combat rules (see the Combat chapter in SRII) rather than the vehicle combat rules in this book.
The listed Speed Ratings for
vehicles with legs represent
Walking speeds. A vehicle's
Running speed is equal to its
Speed Rating multiplied by 2.5.
Vehicles with legs cannot use
their legs to kick during melee
combat. Attempting to do so
results in the vehicle falling.
AIR CUSHION
VEHICLES
Air-cushion vehicles (ACVs),
more commonly known as
hovercraft, cannot climb or
pass across any significant
slope, because they simply
slide down such slopes. The
gamemaster
determines
whether slopes in any given
terrain affect hovercraft in this
manner.
In addition, the buffering effects of an ACV's rubberized side
skirts provide protection when a hovercraft crashes. As a result,
ACV damage levels never exceed Serious damage when they
crash (see Vehicle Damage, p. 49).
Because of their unique operating mode, terrain is defined differently for ACVs, as shown in the ACV Terrain Classifications Table.
ACV TERRAIN CLASSIFICATIONS TABLE
Terrain
Open
Description
Relatively flat areas, including rolling
plains, calm to slightly choppy water,
and normally impassable flat terrain
such as swamps, bogs and marshes
Similar to open terrain, except with scattered moderate obstacles such as light
to dense brush, creek beds, mild slopes
and so on
Normal
Restricted
Any terrain that demands moderately
precise movement, such as suburban
streets, winding roads, hills and medium/heavy woods
Tight
Any terrain that requires exceptionally
precise maneuvering, including urban
settings, badlands, dense woods and
stormy seas
QU VEHICLE OPERATIONS
AIRCRAFT
Aircraft require a certain amount of flat space to take off or
land. The exact amount depends on the aircraft's Landing/Takeoff
profile and its load of cargo and passengers, as shown on the
Runway Distances Table.
The first distance listed in each table category applies when
an aircraft is carrying cargo and passengers that weigh less than
its Load Rating. The second distance applies when the weight of
cargo and passengers equals or exceeds the aircraft's Load Rating.
Note that vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft do not
require runways.
RUNWAY DISTANCES TABLE

Aircraft Profile	Takeoff (in meters)	Landing (in meters)
Normal	B × 150/B × 225	B × 300/ B × 450
STOL (Short Takeoff/Landing)	B × 40/B × 125	B × 75/B × 200
VSTOL (Very Short Takeoff/Landing)	B × 20/B × 45	B × 40/B × 100
VTOL (Vertical Takeoff/Landing)	NA	NA
* = Body

TAKING OFF/LANDING ON UNUSUAL SURFACES
Any time a character attempts to land or perform a takeoff
from an irregular runway surface, in adverse weather conditions or
in a combat situation, the controlling character must make a successful Driving Test to perform the action. Unusual runways
include aircraft carrier decks, automobile highways, water surface
landings (without float-plane adaptation), flat stretches of grassland and so on.
When taking off under such circumstances, the test's base
Target Number is 3. When landing, the base target number is 4.
Any appropriate modifiers from the Takeoff/Landing Modifiers
Table and the Driving Test Modifiers Table (p. 21) apply as well.
In addition, any character attempting to land or perform a
takeoff from a rough or uneven surface must make a Damage
Resistance Test against 6L Damage for the aircraft. This test
reflects the damage caused to the craft's landing gear from rocks,
gravel, potholes and other features of the rough surface.
TAKEOFF AND LANDING MODIFIERS
Situation
Modifier
Cross winds +2
Heavy cross winds +3
Rough or uneven surface +1
STOL profile +1
VSTOL profile +3
Arrestor cable or crash net in use (landing only) -1

TAKEOFF AND LANDING MODIFIERS TABLE KEY
Cross winds: The cross winds modifier applies when strong
winds blow across the runway. The gamemaster determines when
such conditions exist.
Heavy cross winds: The heavy cross winds modifier applies
when storm-generated winds blow across the runway. The
gamemaster determines if such conditions exist.
Rough/uneven surface: This modifier applies when a character attempts to land or perform a takeoff from a rough, uneven
or gravel surface. This modifier does not apply to smooth but
irregular runway surfaces, such as aircraft carrier decks, calm water
or asphalt roadways.
STOL/VSTOL landings/takeoffs: This modifier reflects the
increased difficulty of STOL- and VSTOL-profiled landings or
takeoffs.
Arrestor cable/crash net: This modifier applies if the runway
surface is fitted with an arrestor cable, crash net or other braking
device to stop the aircraft after it has landed. Note that only aircraft equipped with a tailhook can use an arrestor cable to brake
their landing motion.
MONORAILS AND TRAINS
Monorail and standard trains are divided into engines and
cars. Engines possess their own means of propulsion, while
monorail and train cars must be pulled by engines. Note that in
most (though not all) city monorail or subway systems, each car in
* subway train is considered an "engine" because each car can
move on its own.
Though monorails and trains may travel only along fixed rail
paths, characters can alter the speeds of monorail or train engines
by making Driving Tests against the engine's Handling Rating. By
speeding up or slowing down, a character can throw off a wouldbe attacker's aim or tactical maneuver. The Handling Rating of an
engine applies for the entire train that the engine is pulling or
pushing. If two or more engines are propelling a train, use the
highest Handling Rating for the entire train.
Each component of a train, whether an engine or a car, has its
own Body and Armor Ratings. Damage incurred by one car or
engine of a train does not affect the other components.
The Load Rating of an engine indicates the total weight it can
pull, including the weight loaded in cars that the engine is pulling. If
two or more engines are in use on a train, add the Load Ratings. The
Load Rating of a car reflects the weight that car alone can carry.
Public monorail networks are found in megasprawls, and
high-speed monorail lines, such as the Transrapid Superconductor
monorail in the Allied German States, provide passenger service
between cities.
Standard rail lines continue to operate throughout the world
as well, though in North America standard rail lines are generally
relegated to cargo transport duties. In Europe, substantial numbers of passengers use standard rail lines for travel between cities
and countries.
MISSION IMPROBABLE
It started as a simple job. (How many times have you heard that in your life!) I should
have known; few things in my life are ever simple, but that's what you get when you're a
smuggler and sometime runner, making your living outsmarting the Powers That Be. I'd been
hired by a Johnson to retrieve a certain package from an island that lay in Salish territory, which
made sending a ground team a difficult proposition. Border crossings and fake datawork and
all, you know-and it'd have to be good datawork, in case the Salish authorities decided to
get picky about "interlopers" from the UCAS. Good, of course, meaning expensive. Even at
my hefty fee, I was cheaper than the usual running team. The Johnson and her up-front cred
checked out, so I took the job. A simple helicopter flight out to the island, a quick in-and-out,
return trip and a hand- over-easy money, I thought.
* drove my favorite car to the place where I'd hidden my 'copter away. She was my pride
and joy, that Airstar-a good sturdy workhorse of a vehicle, with plenty of nifty mods I'd
made myself. Any decent rigger, in my opinion, also ought to be a halfway decent mechanic-especially a rigger like me, who couldn't always count on a talented and discreet mechanic turning up if a smuggling run went sour.
* waved hello to the maintenance crew, but didn't make much small talk. No time to chat
when biz was waiting to be done. They gave me an all-systems-go report, which was all I
needed to hear. I strode up to the Airstar, checked to make sure I had plenty of ammo for my
gun, then climbed into the pilot's seat.
* jacked into the helicopter's rig and the virtual heads-up display blossomed before my
eyes. Dizziness hit me for a split second; then my mind adjusted to the blizzard of input from
the view screens, which were arrayed before me like the many facets of a cut diamond. The
screens showed views from every angle, as well as numerous data displays. At the moment,
the largest screen, positioned squarely in the center, displayed the status of the Airstar's system as it warmed up.
As I summoned the helicopter to life, I could feel the rumble of the Pratt & Whitney turbojet engines in my chest. The chopper's blades seemed to rotate in sync with the blood pulsing through my limbs. I shifted into forward visual mode; a small icon blinked in a corner of the main view screen, indicating that the hangar door had
opened. I was cleared for takeoff.
* pulled my legs into a crouch. The rotating blades went from
* whine to a roar in response. I leaped upward and the helicopter
rose, slowly but surely soaring upward through the rooftop
hangar door. Once I'd gotten several dozen meters above the roof
of the warehouse, I set the chopper to hovering briefly as I
scanned the Seattle sprawl far below. The low background levels
of thermal and electromagnetic radiation emanating from the city
showed up as a dull red and green glow in my display. I spotted
no active radiation sources, which meant no one was watching
right now.
* turned my attention to the navigational screen. It showed my
target destination as a red dot, a tiny island of hot brightness in the
deep, cool blue of the Pacific Ocean. With another flicker of thought
* commanded the screen to display known sensor watch posts.
They appeared as small radar-dish icons giving off white waves.
* swiftly plotted a course that eluded most of the lookout
points, then stretched my arms over my head, twisted my body
toward Puget Sound, and swept my arms down to my sides. The
Airstar turned and sped toward the moonlight that glinted off the
Sound.
This was going to be a cakewalk. Breeze on out to the target,
pick up the package and come back home. I'd be back in time for
happy hour at the Shack-and this time able to pay my tab, and
just maybe buy a round or three for a certain pretty lady I'd had my
eye on recently. Yep, this was just the kind of job I liked best ...
Suddenly the chopper's warning klaxons started screaming. I
turned my head and my visual display rotated until the rear view
screen occupied my central window. On it I saw two dark flecks
against the pink and gray pre-dawn sky. The Airstar's Identify
Friend or Foe transponders identified the craft as two F-B Eagle
interceptors from the UCASAF's Fifth Air Wing based at McChord.
Before I could make another move, bright spurts of thermographic orange blossomed under the wings of both interceptors
and the helicopter's targeting alarm began to shriek. A warning
message flashed on my heads-up display-both interceptors had
locked on to the Airstar and fired air-to-air missiles.
Instinctively, I arched my body toward the coastline, a movement that turned the helicopter. At the same time I started kicking my legs furiously like an Olympic swimmer, sending the chopper screaming toward the land. But my evasive action didn't fool
the missiles' targeting sensors. The deadly projectiles twisted and
dove after me.
Time for Plan B, then. I focused my mind on the right control,
and a giant red "PANIC" button materialized under my left hand.
* slapped the button. Explosive charges planted at strategic points
along the chopper's body detonated, destroying the brackets that
held the Airstar's outer shell in place. As the shell fell away, it
revealed a second skin coated with radarbane.
* knew I wasn't out of trouble yet. I jackknifed my body
toward the floor like a diver, and five small parachutes blossomed
from the 'copter as it plunged into a power dive. Thermite flares
swung from two of the chutes, bunched strips of aluminum chaff
from two more. The last chute supported a small rocket, hardly
large enough to dent a paper airplane, but containing a transponder and flare that mimicked the Airstar's thermal and electromagnetic signature. The chopper's radarbane skin would cloak it from
the missile's targeting sensors, and the chaff and flares would
temporarily confuse the two missiles, which would then lock on to
the decoy rocket.
* hoped.
Scant seconds after I'd I punched the panic button I felt my
virtual body convulse as the shock waves from two explosions
rocked the helicopter. I twisted around, bringing the chopper
face-to-face with my two attackers, and the direction-finding axes
of the Airstar's targeting program appeared on the main view
screen. I selected and armed two anti-radiation missiles, then cut
them loose as soon as I heard the lock-on chirp twice. The ARMs
appeared like two streaks against the sky as they homed in on the
strong signals from the pursuing flyboys' jammers. A half-second
later the 'copter's targeting alarm fell silent, which told me that
the missiles had destroyed the F-Bs' targeting sensors. (Thank
heaven for ARMs. They lock on to a target's emissions, so the
stronger your opponent's sensors and jammers, the better the
chance your ARMs will find their mark. The F-Bs' ECM suites
would have spiked most of my weapons for sure if the flyboys'd
had a chance to use them. But the ARMs homed in on the jammer signals and saved my hoop.)
Both pursuing planes wavered for a few seconds as small
explosions erupted in their noses where their targeting sensors had
been. Then the flyboys swung around and streaked past me, strafing the Airstar with miniguns. I kept the chopper diving toward the
shoreline; I could feel my skin twitching as I pushed the Airstar
beyond its limits and its body buckled under the strain.
Before the flyboys could swing around for a second pass, a
green wave of Salish radar passed over my view screen. I'd
entered Salish-Shidhe airspace-safe territory for me as far as my
two hunters were concerned. (Though not exactly safe per se ... )
The zoomies broke off pursuit, apparently unwilling to risk an
international incident for one lone 'copter. After a few seconds I
breathed a sigh of relief. I'd heard no warnings from Salish air-traffic control, which meant it hadn't detected me.
* swung the Airstar lower until it almost skimmed the treetops-best way to avoid future encounters-while a nagging
question formed in the back of my mind. Why had the two
zoomies tried to shoot me down with no warning? I'd had plenty
of run-ins with Salish and UCAS jet jockeys during past smuggling
runs, but they'd never opened fire without issuing some kind of
warning or threat first. This geek-first-warn-later bulldrek-that
was a Lone Star trick. Not the kind of thing I was used to getting
from fellow flyers, even if they were the Law and I wasn't.
The glowing orange orb of the sun, just rising over the horizon ahead of me, was beginning to dispel the shadows on the
land below. Too bad it could shed no light on my question. I'd
eluded my flying foes for now, but I couldn't run forever. Sooner
or later I had to go to ground, and then they'd find me.
Well, what the hell. Maybe I could still do what I'd been hired
to do before the cavalry showed up.
* landed the Airstar right where the Johnson had told me to,
then holstered my Ingram and set out to retrieve the package. I
briefly wondered what was in it-something worth sending air
MISSION IMPROBABLE
jockeys after a lone 'copter, maybe? And how had they known
who I was ?- but swiftly dismissed such speculation as useless.
Smugglers who live to spend their earnings learn not to ask
unnecessary questions.
The McNeil Island Penitentiary Compound was looming dead
ahead. It had been abandoned for years, but the Johnson had
warned me that "unfriendly people" would likely be watching the
place. I knew I'd have to make an unorthodox entrance, but I still
wasn't looking forward to it. I reached the entry spot, took a deep
breath, braced myself, and lowered myself down into the storm
sewer that led to the compound's central building.
After wading through stinking raw sewage for what seemed
like hours, I finally came to the manhole I was looking for. I shoved
it to one side, pulled myself up out of the sewer and squeezed
through the narrow aperture, cursing under my breath all the
while. Then, squatting on the damp concrete floor under a heavy
grating, I looked around as best I could in the dim light.
I'd fetched up in a maintenance trench under the ground floor
of the main building. I could see the outlines of power cables and
plumbing pipes; they smelled of rust and rot. Hulking overhead.
toward the back of the trench, I spotted several giant shadowsturbines, which meant I must be under the plant's power room.
MISSION IMPROBABLE
* was reaching up to lift the grating when a faint grinding
noise froze me in place. Then I heard the telltale whine of a laboring combustion engine, growing gradually louder as it came my
way. Twisting my head over my shoulder, I saw a dark shadow
rumble over the grating. I withdrew my fingers as the thing rolled
to a stop directly above me.
It was a patrol drone-an FMC Sentinel. Only slightly larger
than a kid's wagon, it was equipped with tank treads to cover
rough terrain, and it packed enough firepower to ruin any shadowrunner's day. If it detected me, it would certainly ruin mine.
Soundlessly I unlatched the magazine in my Ingram, then
reached into my cargo pocket and withdrew a 30-round clip of
armor-piercing, silicone-coated depleted-uranium shells. As
quietly as I could, I loaded the clip, then flipped the fire-mode
selector switch to AUTO and poked the barrel between the
chinks in the grating.
For the first time that night I was glad to be skulking in a
sewer. If I'd run into the Sentinel above ground, I wouldn't have
stood a chance of destroying it before it spotted me. But like most
drones designed for security work and perimeter detail, the
Sentinel's underbelly was fitted with light armor. After all, no one
expects a security drone to run into anti-tank mines. Sparks flew
as I cut loose with the Ingram and punched several rounds
through the Sentinel's steel skin. The bullets ripping into its
innards touched off electrical fires inside the drone, making it
sputter and pop. A loud explosion knocked me backward as a
stray round burst through the fuel tank. I scurried away as burning
fuel began raining down into the trench.
Within minutes the place was crawling with drones. I had to
expend the rest of my APDU and one thermite grenade before I
found a ventilation duct to hide in. Crawling through the network
of ventilation shafts up to the top floor took me about two hours.
When I finally squirmed out of the narrow shaft, I landed clumsily
in a darkened hallway. To my right was a security door, with an
electronic keypad directly above the knob. Assuming I'd kept the
map in my head straight through all the twists and turns of the
ventilator shafts, the package should be inside.
* loaded another magazine, emptied the Ingram into the lock
and kicked the door open. A quick reload later, I cautiously surveyed the room. It had been some grunt's office once. indistinguishable from a hundred others. A computer terminal sat on top
of a cheap plaswood desk, both of them covered with dust.
* walked over to the terminal. A chip was loaded in one of its
drive slots. I opened the desk's top drawer-just as I'd hoped,
there were a few thumbtacks still rolling around in it. I took out a
thumbtack, stuck its pointy end in the slot and wiggled it around
until the chip popped out. Package retrieved.
I'd hardly turned around when alarm klaxons started blaring
all around me. The sound of running feet came from the corridor
outside; no exit that way. I turned wildly toward the office's sole
window, only to see a curtain of thin steel plates ripple down to
cover it. The sharp thud of the door hitting the wall made me spin
back around, Ingram raised, to confront my new enemy-four
armored security guards whose uniform patches I didn't recognize. All of their guns were pointed straight at me.
For about five seconds, nobody moved. Then I heard a familiar voice from the hallway.
"Thank you, gentlemen," said my Johnson as she sauntered
into the room. "You can put the guns away now."
As the sec-boys lowered their weapons, the Johnson gave me
* brilliant smile. "Congratulations, Roy," she said. "You passed."
* eased my grip on the Ingram a fraction ... but only a fraction. "This was a test? Just a test?"
"I needed to find out if you were worth your reputation," she
answered. "And it seems you are. You've been quite resourceful.
* can't afford anything less-not for the job I have in mind."
"And the chip?" Curiosity was fighting with anger now. I
decided it couldn't hurt me to let curiosity win. "Is it something,
or just worthless drek?"
"Oh, it's something, all right." The Johnson laughed softly.
"Consider it your payment for today's work, should you decide
you'd rather not be part of the real mission." She gave me a measuring look, then continued. "Would you care to hear about it?"
"You'd really let me leave now? Just like that?"
"Just like that. I need willing participants, Roy, not just hired
guns who might decide to cut and run when things get more dangerous than they bargained for. From what I learned about you
before setting up this little excursion, I'd say you might be a willing participant-once you know everything. But for the moment
... " She gave me another sizing-up look. "What are your feelings
about the Draco Foundation?"
* nearly dropped the Ingram in surprise. "Can't say I have any,
one way or the other," I managed to say after a moment. "Why?
Are you working for them or against them?"
"For." Another soft laugh. "Oh, definitely for. Which I'll
prove to your satisfaction, if you want to hear about the job.
Over dinner. You choose the restaurant-though I will say, I'm
partial to Thai."
* holstered the Ingram. "I know a place in Tacoma. Roong Petch.
Hole in the wall, but it serves the best yellow curry in town."
"You can still back out after dinner," she said. "I'll tell you
enough to let you know what you're likely in for, not so much that
you'll be a danger to us if you refuse. As I said, I need more than
just hired guns."
* nodded toward the door. "Time's wasting, ma'am-and I'm
getting hungry."
She smiled at that-a warm smile that lit up her blue eyes. I
had a nagging feeling that I'd seen her somewhere before-and
not on this job, either-but dismissed it as smuggler's paranoia.
As I followed her and the sec-boys out of the room, I wondered
just what kind of drek-pile I might be getting myself into. You
know the old saying-never deal with a dragon, or with a dragon's employees .
VEHICLE COMBAT
The vehicle combat system in this chapter replaces the system described on pages 105-9
of the Shadowrun, Second Edition rulebook. This vehicle combat system is intended to preserve the spirit, if not the mechanics, of the existing Shadowrun rules by providing a simple, mapless system for resolving vehicle combat and individual character actions simultaneously.
This section lays the foundation for the new vehicle combat system and provides rules for
resolving vehicle damage caused by weapons fire, crashes and collisions with objects such as
walls, passengers and other vehicles; rules for firing vehicle weapons and vehicles and magic.
For drone rules, see Drones, p. 62.

THE MANEUVER SCORE
The Maneuver Score is the cornerstone of the vehicle combat system. This rating measures the relative tactical advantage of a vehicle engaged in combat and is used when resolving nearly all vehicle combat maneuvers. Generally, a character receives bonuses or penalties
for his vehicle combat maneuvers based on the current Maneuver Score of his vehicle. (The
specific application of the Maneuver Score is described in the rules for each vehicle combat
maneuver.)
The Maneuver Score consists of four components: Vehicle Points, Terrain Points, Speed
Points and Driver Points. During each Combat Turn, these components and the Maneuver
Score itself-change to reflect the shifting conditions of combat. Either players or gamemasters may monitor these changing scores, depending on the preferences of the group.
If a pedestrian and a vehicle interact, resolve the situation by assigning the pedestrian a
Maneuver Score equal to his Quickness.

DETERMINING THE MANEUVER SCORE
The Maneuver Score is determined by adding together a
vehicle's Vehicle Points, Terrain Points, Speed Points and Driver
Points during a Combat Turn. Once a vehicle's Maneuver Score is
determined for a turn, that score is used throughout the turn.
When the next Combat Turn begins, the four components and the
Maneuver Score are re-calculated.
Vehicle Points
The Vehicle Points for a turn may be positive or negative
depending on the type of vehicle a character is driving. The Vehicle
Points Table lists the Vehicle Points for the various vehicle types.
VEHICLE POINTS TABLE
Vehicle Type Vehicle Points
Car/Pickup Truck 0
Sports Car +3
Motorcycle +5
Limousine/Light Truck/Van -3

HSCT/Suborbital -15
Semiballistic -25
Small Motorboat 0
Racing Boat +5
Yacht -10
ACV/Hovercraft +2
Train/Monorail -10

Terrain Points
Terrain Points are negative values that reduce a vehicle's Maneuver Score. Terrain Point values for the four basic types of terrain are listed in the Terrain Points Table.

TERRAIN POINTS TABLE
|Terrain |Terrain Points|
|Open|0|
|Normal|-2|
|Restricted|-4|
|Tight|-10|

Speed Points
To determine a vehicle's Speed Points, divide the vehicle's speed by ten and round down the result.
Driver Points
The player makes an Open Test using the relevant Vehicle. Skill to generate his Driver Points (see Open Tests, below). Keep a separate tally of the Driver Points generated from the Open Test; these points also determine the first Combat Phase in which passengers can act. (See Passenger Actions during Vehicle Combat, p. 49, for more information.)
OPEN TESTS
Unlike standard Success or Opposed Tests, in which players attempt to achieve set target numbers with their dice rolls, Open Tests have no target numbers. Instead, the result of the Open Test may serve as a target number for subsequent tests or generate other numbers, such as Driver Points. When making an Open Test, a player rolls a number of dice equal to the skill or attribute he is using for the test. The player then discards all but the highest single die result.
The Rule of Six (p. 32, SRII) does apply to Open Tests; a player can re-roll any die that produces a "6" and add the result.
Rich rolls 5 dice on an Open Test. He scores 6, 6, 4, 3, and 1. Re-rolling the two 6s, he achieves a 6 and 2, so he re-rolls the 6 yet again and gets a result of 4. That gives Rich a result of 16 (6 + 6 + 4) for a single six-sided die.
VEHICLE COMBAT TURN SEQUENCE
The Vehicle Combat Turn uses the following sequence. Note that gamemasters must calculate Maneuver Scores for all NPC
vehicles.
1. Determine starting distance and speeds (first Combat Turn
only).
2. Determine the Vehicle, Terrain and Speed Points for each
vehicle.
3. Allocate Control Pool dice.
4. Determine Driver Points and calculate the final vehicle
Maneuver Scores for the Combat Turn.
5. Determine Initiative.
6. Characters take actions and resolve results.
7. Determine changes in speed, distance or terrain.
8. Begin a new Combat Turn.


VEHICLE COMBAT
1. Determine starting distances and speeds (first Combat Turn only).
Before vehicle combat begins, the gamemaster determines the starting speeds of NPC vehicles and distances between each vehicle. Vehicles that are stopped, parked or idling begin with starting Speeds of 0. Players may declare the starting speeds of their vehicles, though the gamemaster chooses the starting speed of any vehicle whose driver is incapacitated or unconscious.
All Dice Pools for drivers, passengers and pedestrians also refresh, per standard Combat Turn rules (p. 78, SRII).
2. Determine the Vehicle, Terrain and Speed Points for each vehicle. After determining the Vehicle, Terrain and Speed Points for each vehicle (see the preceding Vehicle Points, Terrain Points and Speed Points subsections), combine these values to produce a partial Maneuver Score for each vehicle.
3. Allocate Control Pool dice.
Each player may allocate Control Pool dice for the Open Test used to determine his Driver Points for the turn (see preceding Driver Points subsection for details). Dice allocated for this test are not available for any other purpose during the turn. These dice do not refresh at the start of each Combat Phase; they refresh at the end of the Combat Turn. All remaining Control Pool dice refresh per standard rules and may be used for Driving Tests during each phase of the character's Initiative.
4. Determine Driver Points and finalize vehicle Maneuver Scores for the Combat Turn.
Each player makes an Open Test to determine each vehicle's Driver Points (gamemasters make the test for NPC vehicles).
Add the Driver Points to the partial Maneuver Scores generated in Step 2. The results are the Maneuver Score for each vehicle.
5. Determine Initiative.
Every player rolls Initiative for his character at this timewhether the character is driving a vehicle, riding as a passenger or
standing on the ground as a pedestrian.
Remember that Initiative dice bonuses apply only to riggers
who are jacked into vehicles. Bonuses for boosted and wired
reflexes, physical adept increases and magic do NOT apply for drivers when determining Initiative.
Passenger characters must hold their actions until the phase
indicated by the driver's Driver Points (see Passenger Actions
during Vehicle Combat, p. 49).
6. Characters take actions and resolve results.
All characters (drivers, passengers and pedestrians) take their
actions. The order in which characters act is determined by their
Initiative results, per standard combat rules (pp. 78-80, SRII).
Resolve all character actions.
7. Determine changes in speed, distance and terrain.
After resolving all actions, the gamemaster determines if any
vehicles have changed speed, based on their actions during the
turn. If necessary, the gamemaster calculates changes in distances
between vehicles, based on the new speeds.
The gamemaster also decides if any vehicles have moved into
* different terrain type during the Combat Turn. If so, terrain
changes take effect during this phase.
8. Begin a new Combat Turn.
Begin a new Combat Turn. Distances and speeds have
already been determined for the new turn, so start with Step 2.
Control Pool Dice allocated for Driver Points Open Tests
refresh at this time.
Rigger X is trying to make a fast getaway from two
Lone Star cruisers hot on his tail. At the beginning of the
chase, Rigger X's Mach 6 (his souped-up Westwind
2000) is burning rubber at a speed of 250 meters per
Combat Turn, while the pursuing cops are doing 275
meters per turn and are a few blocks behind him. X and
his pursuers are roaring down Central Avenue, a fivelane city street. Fortunately, only very light traffic is on
the street.
The starting distance and speeds have already been set, so Rigger X's player and the gamemaster now determine the Vehicle, Terrain and Speed Points for each vehicle. Their calculations might look like this:
Mach 6
Sports car +3 Vehicle Pts.
Normal terrain -2 Terrain Pts.
250 m/turn
25 Speed Pts.
Partial Maneuver Score
26
Lone Star Cruisers
Regular car
* Vehicle Pts.
Normal terrain
-2 Terrain Pts.
275 m/turn
27 Speed Pts.
Partial Maneuver Score
25
Allocating Control Pool Dice is the next step. Rigger
* decides to allocate 4 of his 7 Control Pool Dice for the
Driver Points Open Test. That leaves Rigger X with only
* Control Dice available for other actions during the
Combat Turn.
The cops driving the Lone Star Cruisers are NPCs, so
they use their Professional Rating dice (Rating 2) in place
of Control Pool Dice. (Because they are NPCs, the cops
may also use their 2 Threat/Professional Rating dice for
Success Tests.)
Now the player and gamemaster make Open Tests
to determine the Driver Points for their characters. Rigger
* has a Car Skill 5 and has allocated 4 Control Pool dice
for the test, so he rolls 9 dice and obtains the following
results: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 5 and 6. Re-rolling the 6, he
gets a result of 5, which makes his highest die result 11.
That gives Rigger X 11 Driver Points.
The gamemaster makes the Open Tests for the two
cops. Both cops have Car Skill 3 and 2 Professional
Rating dice, so the gamemaster rolls 5 dice for each car.
The first (Cruiser #1) generates a 2, 3, 5, 6 and 6; rerolling the two 6s, the gamemaster gets a 1 and 2, so
the final tally is 2, 3, 5, 7 and 8. That gives Cruiser #1 8
Driver Points.
On the Open Test for Cruiser #2, the gamemaster
rolls a 3, 4, 5, 6 and 6. Re-rolling the two 6s produces a
* and 6. Re-rolling the 6 again, the gamemaster gets a
VEHICLE COMBAT
3, so the highest die result is 15. That gives Cruiser #2
15 Driver Points.
Now the player and gamemaster add the Driver
Points to their characters' partial Maneuver Scores. That
gives the characters the following Maneuver Scores for
the turn:
Character Maneuver Score
Rigger X 11 + 26 37
Cruiser #1 8 + 25 = 33
Cruiser #2 15 + 25 = 40
At this point, all the player characters involvedincluding Rigger X's passengers and the other cops riding shotgun in the two cruisers-make Initiative Tests, and the standard Combat Turn begins.
VEHICLE ACTIONS
In addition to standard character actions, such as activating cyberware, observing in detail, non-combat Driving Tests and so on, drivers can perform the following vehicle actions. Note that all these actions are considered Complex Actions.
* Accelerating/Braking: The driver attempts to change his vehicle's speed, either to close the distance with another vehicle or to increase his distance from other vehicles.
* Positioning: The driver attempts to maneuver his vehicle into a better tactical position for fighting.
* Ramming: The driver attempts to ram another vehicle with his vehicle.
* Hiding: The driver attempts to break contact with another vehicle(s).
* Performing a Non-Driving Action: Non-driving actions include firing personal weapons, using onboard electronics, activating cyberware and so on.
If a pursuing vehicle's speed increase is equal to or greater than the distance between the vehicle and its target, multiplied by 2, the vehicle can ram the targeted vehicle or pedestrian during the controlling player's next available action.
ACCELERATE/BRAKE TARGET MODIFIERS TABLE KEY
Higher/Lower Maneuver Score: If the Maneuver Score of the
driver's vehicle exceeds the Maneuver Score of the vehicle he is
chasing or fleeing, the target number for his Driving Test is
reduced, as shown on the table. If the Maneuver Score of the
opposing vehicle exceeds the score of the driver's vehicle, the
target number is increased, as shown. If a vehicle is fleeing or
chasing more than one vehicle, use the highest Maneuver Score
of the opposing vehicles when determining this modifier.
Fleeing from more than one vehicle: If the driver is attempting to flee from two or more vehicles, apply a +1 target modifier
for each additional vehicle. For example, a vehicle fleeing 2
opposing vehicles receives a +1 target modifier, while a vehicle
fleeing 3 opposing vehicles receives a +2 modifier.
Autonav is active: An active autonavigation system hinders
combat maneuvers because it will attempt to decrease the vehicle's speed to a safe limit. If a vehicle's autonav system is active,
apply a target modifier equal to the vehicle's Autonav Rating.
Turning the autonavigation system on or off is a Simple Action; if
the driver is jacked into a vehicle, these are Free Actions.
VCR implant: If the driver is a rigger jacked into a rigged
vehicle, reduce the target number by an amount equal to the rigger's VCR cyberware rating.
Cruiser #1 and Cruiser #2 are only 300 meters
behind Rigger X, who decides to accelerate in an
attempt to lose the two Lone Star cars.

ACCELERATING/BRAKING
Accelerating and braking are two
related actions. In both cases, the driver
is trying to change his vehicle's speed.
To resolve either action, the driver
makes a Driving Test against the vehicle's Handling. Apply any appropriate
modifiers from the Accelerate/Brake
Target Modifiers Table.
If the Accelerating/Braking Test succeeds, the vehicle increases or decreases its current speed. The increase or
decrease is equal to the vehicle's
Acceleration Rating, multiplied by the
number of successes generated on the
test. However, no vehicle can exceed its
Speed Rating by more than 50 (Speed
Rating times 1.5) percent of the rating.
All vehicles receive 1 Stress Point whenever they exceed their Speed Ratings.

VEHICLE COMBAT
The base target number for the Accelerating Test is
the Mach 6's Handling Rating of 3. The following target
modifiers also apply:
Cruiser #2's Maneuver Score of 40 exceeds
Mach 6's score by 10 or less +2
Rigger X is fleeing two vehicles +1
The Mach 6's current speed of 250 m/turn exceeds its Speed Rating of 210 +1
Normal terrain 0
Rigger X has a Level 2 VCR and is jacked into the Mach 6 -2
Final target modifier +2
That leaves Rigger X with a Target Number 5 for the test.
Rigger X, who has Car Skill 5, decides to spend his
remaining 3 Control Pool Dice on the test. Rolling 8 dice,
he achieves 2 successes. Multiplying the 2 successes by
the Mach 6's Acceleration Rating of 18 generates a result
of 36. This gives the Mach 6 a current speed of 286, well
below the car's limit of 315 meters per turn (210 x 1.5).
The Mach 6 does, however, receive 1 Stress Point for
exceeding its Speed Rating.
Cruiser #2 acts next and decides to close in on Rigger X. His vehicle has a Handling Rating 4, so the target number for the Driving Test is 4. The following target
modifiers apply:

Cruiser #2's Maneuver Score exceeds Rigger X's score by 10 or less -2
The car's current speed of 275 m/turn exceeds the car's Speed Rating of 240 +1
Normal terrain 0
The cruiser's Level 3 Autonav is active +3
Final target modifier +2

That gives Cruiser #2 a Target Number 6 for the test.
The gamemaster rolls 5 dice for the test (3 for the driver's
Car Skill and 2 for his Professional Rating). The test yields 3
successes, so Cruiser #2's speed increases by 42
(Acceleration Rating of 14 x 3 successes = 42). That means
Cruiser #2 speeds up to 317 meters per turn.
Let's skip to the end of the turn for a moment and
assume that no other driving actions take place during
the turn. The Mach 6's new speed is 286, while Cruiser
#2's new speed is 317. 317 minus 286 equals 31, so
Cruiser #2 closes 31 meters on the Mach 6 during the
turn. The starting distance at the beginning of the turn
was 300 meters, so at the start of the next turn Cruiser
#2 is 269 meters behind Rigger X.

VEHICLE COMBAT
POSITIONING
Positioning a vehicle enables a driver to place his vehicle in a
better tactical position for subsequent actions. In game terms, a
successful positioning attempt gives a vehicle a higher Maneuver
Score for the next Combat Turn, which puts the vehicle at a tactical advantage and gives its passengers more opportunities to act.
* driver can also make a positioning attempt to bring his
vehicle to a stop at a particular point in order to provide a coverIng position for characters to enter, exit, mount or dismount the
vehicle.
To position a vehicle, the driver makes a Positioning Test,
using his Driving Skill, against a target number equal to his vehice's Handling Rating. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the
Positioning Target Modifiers Table. Record the number of successes generated on the test and add this value to the driver's Driver
Points at the start of the next Combat Turn. These additional Driver
Points increase the vehicle's Maneuver Score and allow passengers to act during later Combat Phases of the turn (see Passenger
Actions during Vehicle Combat, p. 49).

Cruiser #1's driver decides to position his vehicle for better tactical advantage against the Mach 6. The base target number for the Positioning Test is the car's Handling Rating of 4, with the following modifiers:
Cruiser's speed of 275 m/turn exceeds its Speed Rating of 240 +1
Normal terrain 0
The cruiser's Autonav is off 0
Final target modifier +1

That produces a final Target Number 5 for the test.
The gamemaster rolls 5 dice for the driver (Car 3 plus 2
for the cop's Professional Rating) and generates only one
success. At the start of the next turn, Cruiser #1 can add
* to the result of the Open Test to determine the Driver
Points for Cruiser #1's Maneuver Score.
If the driver is attempting to position his vehicle to stop at a.
particular point, the gamemaster determines how far the vehicle
must travel to reach the desired spot. The result of the Positioning
Test is multiplied by the vehicle's Acceleration Rating to determine how much of the distance the vehicle can cover. If the final
result equals or exceeds the required distance, the driver is able
to pull off the maneuver. Otherwise, the positioning attempt fails.
Josie Cruise is transporting a runner team in her helicopter Angelfire (Acceleration 14) to a designated landing zone outside a Seretech research compound, 140
meters from Angelfire's current location.
Josie decides makes a positioning attempt to bring
Angelfire to a hover right above the landing zone. Her
Positioning Test generates 4 successes, however, which
means that Angelfire only travels 56 meters (4 x 14) during the attempt. This leaves her 84 meters short of the
landing zone.
RAMMING
In a ramming attempt, the driver attempts to hit another
vehicle or a pedestrian with his own vehicle.
First, the distance between the vehicle and its target must be
less than the vehicle's Acceleration Rating. If the distance is
greater, the vehicle driver can accelerate to close the distance (see
Accelerating/Braking, p. 45). If the acceleration test produces a
speed change greater than twice the distance, the vehicle driver
may attempt to ram the target on his next available action.
Drivers may also make ramming attempts to break through
walls or run down pedestrians.
To resolve a ramming attempt, the controlling player makes
* Ramming Test using his Driving Skill against a target number
equal to his vehicle's Handling Rating. Apply all appropriate modifiers from the Ramming Target Modifiers Table. If the test succeeds, the vehicle collides with the target.
Both the ramming vehicle and the target make Damage
Resistance Tests against Collision Damage (see Vehicle Damage
from Impact, p. 50). To determine the Power of the Damage
Code, calculate the difference in speed between the two vehicles,
then divide the result by 10 and round that number up to the
nearest whole number. The attacker reduces the Power of the collision damage by his vehicle's Body Rating multiplied by the number of successes on his test. For the Damage Level, use the level corresponding to the difference in speed between the two vehicles, as shown on the Impact Damage Levels Table (p. 50). Both players may add available Control Pool dice to the Damage Resistance Test.

If either vehicle sustains damage from the ram, the controlling player must make a Crash Test (see Crashing, p. 51).
* desperate Rigger X decides to take out one of the
Lone Star cruisers by ramming it. His Mach 6 has a
Maneuver Score of 46, versus Cruiser #2's Maneuver
Score of 35, so he figures the tactic will work.
Too much distance separates the Mach 6 from the
cruisers, so Rigger X makes a Braking Test. The test nets
* speed change of 110 meters per turn, which slows the
Mach 6 down to 176 meters per turn. That figure still
exceeds the 50 meters that separate the Mach 6 and the
nearest cruiser (Cruiser #2), so Rigger X must wait until
the next phase before he can ram the cruiser.
Having nothing to lose, Rigger X attempts to ram
the cop car on his next action. The Ramming Test base
target number is 3 (the Mach 6's Handling Rating), and
the following modifiers apply:
Attacker's Maneuver Score exceeds
target's by 11 or more -4
Normal terrain 0
Attacker has a Level 2 VCR -2

The final Target Number is 3 - 4 - 2, or -3, which
rounds up to 2 (since no target number can have a value
less than 2).
Rigger X decides not to use any Control Pool dice,
so he rolls 5 dice for the test (he has Car Skill 5). The test
generates 5 successes, so the Mach 6 collides with Cruiser #2.
HIDING
To hide from or break contact with another vehicle, the controlling player makes a Hiding Test using his Driving Skill against a
base target number equal to his vehicle's Handling Rating. Apply
all appropriate modifiers from the Hiding Target Modifiers Table.
If the test succeeds, the vehicle breaks contact with the other
vehicle(s) and also receives an Escape Bonus equal to the number
of successes generated in the test. At the start of the next Combat
Turn, the driver may add the Escape Bonus to his Driver Points.
The Escape Bonus applies each Combat Turn until the other vehicle(s) relocate the hiding vehicle (see Relocating, p. 49) or give
up trying.
In addition, a vehicle attempting to relocate the hiding vehicle must add the number of successes in the Hiding Test to the target number for the Relocating Test.

Enough positioning! Rigger X decides it's time to give Cruiser #1 the slip.
The Mach 6's Maneuver Score is 46, while Cruiser #1's score is 36. Both vehicles are now roaring down
King Street at 250 meters/turn.
The base target number for Rigger X's Hiding Test is
* (the Mach 6's Handling Rating), and the following target modifiers apply:
Base Target Number 6
Hiding vehicle's Maneuver Score exceeds opponent's by 10 or less -2
The Mach 6 is exceeding its Speed Rating +2
Restricted terrain 0
Rigger X has a Level 2 VCR -2
Final target number 4

Rigger X rolls 5 dice for the test (his Car Skill rating
is 5). The test yields 4 successes, so the Mach 6 gives
Cruiser #1 the slip for the rest of the Combat Turn. In
addition, Rigger X receives a 4-point Escape Bonus on
his Driver Points Open Tests until the pursuing vehicle
relocates the Mach 6 or gives up the attempt.
RELOCATING
Any time a vehicle makes a successful hiding attempt and,
breaks contact, the pursuing vehicle's character can attempt to re
cate the hiding vehicle by making a Relocating Test. To make
Relocating Test, the player makes a Perception Test against a targ
number equal to the hiding vehicle's Signature. Apply all approp
ate target modifiers from the Relocating Target Modifiers Table.
VEHICLE COMBAT
If the test succeeds, the pursuer re-establishes contact with the
hiding vehicle. The pursuing vehicle's driver and passengers may
take actions against the target vehicle on their next available actions.
Players may attempt to relocate hiding vehicles for as long as
they wish.
NPC drivers attempt to relocate hiding vehicles for 5 Combat
Tums, then they give up.

Mach 6.
Rigger X achieved 4 successes on his Hiding Test, so
the Lone Star driver's Relocating Test receives a +4 target
modifier in addition to all other appropriate modifiers.
MULTIPLE VEHICLE COMBAT
Though the preceding rules work for more than two vehicles,
gamemasters may want to group two or more NPC vehicles
together if they're cooperating to achieve the same goal (for
example, two Lone Star cruisers chasing down a suspected perpetrator). In this case, the gamemaster can make single die rolls
for the entire vehicle group. In such cases, use the statistics of the
fastest vehicle in the group when determining the Maneuver
Score and increase the test target number modifier by 1 for each
additional vehicle.
PASSENGER ACTIONS DURING VEHICLE COMBAT
During vehicle combat, passengers can use vehicle electronics,
fire vehicle weapons, hang on or shoot or cast spells at other vehicles. If passengers choose to perform any of these actions, they
must account for certain restrictions. Because of the chaotic movements of the vehicle during combat, characters may not always be
able to act during all their available phases in a Combat Turn. No
character except the rigger may take any offensive action (shooting
weapons or casting spells) in a Combat Phase higher than the number of Driver Points generated for the vehicle in that turn.
If passengers have Initiative scores higher than the Driver
Points of the vehicle they are riding in, they simply lose actions.
They cannot hold actions until their turn and still get in their full
number of attacks. (Being at the mercy of the rigger means being
at her mercy. Vehicle passengers ride along with no control over
their surroundings.)
Blade is riding shotgun in the Mach 6 next to Rigger
* as the two try to give the slip to two Lone Star cruisers. Doing his own little part in discouraging the cops
from following so closely, Blade leans out the window to
pop a few caps with his Ares Predator.
Blade, who has wired reflexes, rolled an Initiative of
17 for the turn. Normally, he would receive actions in
Phases 17 and 7. However, Rigger X generated only 11
Driver Points on his Open Test. That means no passenger
in Rigger X's car can act offensively before Phase 11, so
Blade loses his action in Phase 17.
VEHICLE DAMAGE
Vehicles receive damage when they are hit by weapons fire
and when they collide with objects such as other vehicles, pedestrians, walls and so on.
Vehicle damage is divided into two categories: impact damage from collisions and ramming attacks, and weapons damage
(which includes spell damage).
Condition Monitors are used to track damage to vehicles in
the same manner they are used to track damage to characters.
Vehicle damage is categorized by the standard condition levelsLight, Moderate, Serious and Destroyed (Deadly), and vehicles
receive target modifiers, Initiative penalties and Speed Rating
reductions based on their damage status, as shown on the Vehicle
Damage Modifiers Table.
The damage target modifier applies to all tests that involve
the vehicle itself. The Initiative penalty reduces Initiative results
generated for the vehicle's driver. The Speed Rating reduction
reduces the vehicle's Speed Rating. Because the vehicle's maximum speed is equal to its Speed Rating multiplied by 1.5, this
reduction also applies to a vehicle's maximum speed.
RIGGER DAMAGE
Whenever a vehicle sustains Serious or Destroyed damage,
damage is transferred to the rigger driving the vehicle. In such
cases, the controlling rigger must make a Damage Resistance Test
against 6M Physical damage. If a vehicle is destroyed, the rigger
must make a Resistance Test against 6S Physical damage.

VEHICLE DAMAGE FROM IMPACT
Impact damage occurs when a vehicle fails a Crash Test or is rammed by another vehicle.
The Damage Level of impact damage is based on the vehicle's speed at the time of impact, as shown on the Impact
Damage Levels Table. For a rammed vehicle (see Ramming, p.
47), the Damage Level is based on the difference in speed
between the two vehicles.
The Power is equal to the speed divided by 10 and rounded up.
When making Damage Resistance tests to resist impact damage, a vehicle's player can use a number of dice equal to the vehicle's Body Rating, as well as any available Control Pool dice.
However, the number of Control Pool dice cannot exceed the rigger's Driving Skill. The target number for the test equals the Power
of the attack. No armor or any other factor reduces the Power of
the attack. For every two successes on the test, reduce the
Damage Level by one level.
Rigger X's Mach 6 is traveling at 152 meters per
turn when it rams Lone Star Cruiser #2, which is traveling at 300 meters per turn. The calculation for the Power
of the resulting damage looks like this:
(300 - 152) + 10 = 14.8, rounded up to 15
As shown on the Impact Damage Levels Table, a
collision at 148 meters per turn rates a Damage Level of
Serious. Therefore, both the Mach 6 and Cruiser #2 must

make tests to resist 15S Damage from the collision.
First, let's look at the Mach 6's test The Mach 6 has
* Body Rating of 3, so Rigger X must/roll 3 dice against
* Base Target Number of 15. However, Rigger X's
Ramming Test yielded 5 successes, which reduces the
damage's Power by 15 (vehicle Body Rating x number of
successes).
Target numbers cannot be reduced below 2, so the
Damage Code is 2S. Rigger X adds 5 dice from his
Control Pool, so he rolls a total of 8 dice against a Target
Number 2. The Damage Resistance Test generates 6 successes, which stages the damage down to nothing, and
the Mach 6 pulls away with nothing more than a scratch
or two.
Now let's look at Cruiser #2. The cruiser was the target of the ramming attempt, so the Damage Code of 15S
is not reduced. The cop driving the cruiser is an NPC with
* Professional Rating 2, so the gamemaster can add 2
dice to the 3 dice for the cruiser's Body Rating 3. Rolling
* dice against a Target Number 15, the gamemaster
generates no successes. Consequently, the cruiser takes
Serious damage and must now make a Crash Test.
Passengers
Passengers may incur damage during vehicle collisions ev
when the vehicle itself escapes damage. Passengers must ma
the same Damage Resistance Test as the vehicle. Apply all ve
cle-related Damage Level reductions before making these test
If a character is wearing a seat belt or other safety restra
during the collision, stage down the Damage Level an addition
level.
If the vehicle is equipped with an APPS crash-protection s
tem, reduce the Power of the attack by one half, rounded up.
If the vehicle is equipped with a crash cage, players may a
* dice to their Damage Resistance Tests.
Passengers cannot use Combat Pool dice to assist in the to
but Control Pool dice used by the rigger in the Crash Test also a
to passengers' Damage Resistance Tests. Only impact armor p
tects against crash damage.
The Damage Resistance Test for Cruiser #2 didn't
stage down the damage, so the two cops riding in the
car must make Damage Resistance Tests. The initial
Damage Code is 15S, but is reduced as follows:
Cops are wearing seat belts
Reduce Damage
Level by one level
[15M]
Cruiser is equipped with APPS
Power + 2, rounded
up [8M]
Cops are wearing
armor vests (4/3 Rating)
Reduce Power by 3
[5M]
That produces a final Damage Code of 5M.
The cops have Body Ratings of 4, so the gamemaster
rolls 4 dice for their Damage Resistance Tests.
They don't succeed in reducing the damage, and
the two Lone Star boys take Moderate damage.
Crashing
Crashing is a specific type of impact that usually occurs when
the driver or rigger has lost control of a vehicle due to unique circumstances. Specifically, Crash Tests are required in the following
situations:
·Vehicle takes damage during a ramming action
·Vehicle takes Serious damage in a single attack (including
weapon and spell attacks)
·Vehicle's Condition Monitor reaches "Destroyed"
The Crash Test consists of a Driving Test against a base target
number equal to the vehicle's Handling Rating. All appropriate
target modifiers from the Crash Test Modifiers Table, p. 52, also
apply. Both Autonav and Control Pool dice may be used for a
Crash Test. A number of dice equal to the Autonav Rating may be
used, but the number of Control Pool dice used may not exceed
the rating of the Driving Skill used for the test.
If the test fails, the vehicle crashes. The vehicle comes to a complete stop and the player must make another Damage Resistance
Test to resist impact damage. (Also see Passengers, p. 50.)
Cruiser #2 spins wildly out of control after Rigger X's
Mach 6 rams it. Time to see if the Lone Star officer can
get this under control before it crashes into the side of a
building.
The base target number for the Crash Test equals the
cruiser's Handling Rating of 4, but the following target
modifiers apply:
Cruiser has taken Serious damage

Cruiser's speed (300 m/turn) exceeds
the driver's Reaction Rating x 40

The gamemaster rolls 5 dice (3 for the driver's Car
Skill 3 and 2 for his Professional Rating 2) for the test. The
test produces no successes, however, so the vehicle
crashes into the side of a building.
How much more damage can the cruiser withstand?
Let's find out.
The cruiser was traveling at 300 meters/turn before
it crashed, so the Power for the damage is 300 + 10, or
30 (see Vehicle Damage from Impact, p. 50).
Consulting the Impact Table, crashing at 300 meters/turn
results in a damage level of D. Thus, the Damage Code
for the crash damage is 30D.
The gamemaster rolls 3 dice for the cruiser's Body
Rating 3. (Though the cruiser has an Armor Rating 6, this
does not apply because armor does not affect collision
damage.) Not surprisingly, the test generates no successes, so the cop car bursts into a ball of flames as it
slams into the nearest wall.
COLLIDING WITH OBJECTS
When vehicles crash, they sometimes collide with other
objects, such as walls or pedestrians. Other times, drivers may
deliberately ram objects. In either case, the targeted object also
takes collision damage.
Individual gamemasters determine exactly which objects
crashing vehicles strike, based on the immediate environment,
terrain type, time of day and so on.
Walls and Barriers
Walls and barriers are the most common objects with which
vehicles collide. In some instances, a vehicle collision may cause
enough damage to destroy and collapse a structure. Other times,
* vehicle will travel right through a barrier, collapsing it and then
continuing on its path of destruction.
To determine what happens in such collisions, compare the
Barrier Rating of the wall/barrier with the vehicle's speed at the
time of the collision. (Barrier Ratings are listed on p. 98 of SRII.) If
the vehicle speed is less than or equal to the Barrier Rating multi
plied by 20, the vehicle comes to a halt. Use the standard cras
rules to resolve vehicle and passenger damage in such cases.
If the vehicle speed is greater than the Barrier Rating multi
plied by 20, the wall collapses and the vehicle continues traveling
through it. The vehicle loses speed after such a collision, howey
er. The speed loss equals the Barrier Rating multiplied by 20.
The Power of the collision damage equals the Barrier Rating
of the wall. Use the loss in speed on the Impact Damage Level
Table (p. 50) to determine the Damage Level. If a vehicle break
through a wall or barrier, passengers do not take damage if the
are restrained by some kind of safety gear. Any of the passenge
safety gear found in Passengers (p. 50) reduce this damage.
Cruiser #2 is traveling 300 meters per turn when it
crashes and strikes a factory wall. The wall is Heavy
Structural Material with a Barrier Rating of 16. The Barrier
Rating multiplied by 20 equals 320, which exceeds the
cruiser's speed. Therefore, the cruiser crumples and
comes to a complete stop against the intact wall.
Vehicle-Pedestrian Collisions
Whenever a vehicle collides with a person or critter, th
pedestrian must make a Damage Resistance Test against th
impact damage. The Power of the damage is equal to the spee
of the vehicle divided by 10, and the Damage Level is one stag
higher than that listed on the Impact Damage Levels Table for th
vehicle speed. (For example, a vehicle moving between 1 and 2
meters per turn would inflict Moderate damage on an unlud
pedestrian.) If the corresponding Damage Level on the Impa
Damage Levels Table is Destroyed, the Power of the attao
increases by half of its original rating, rounded down.
Pedestrians make standard Damage Resistance Tests to res
this damage and may use available Combat Pool dice on the tes
Impact armor reduces the Power of the damage. Do not stage
the Damage Level for critters with hardened armor or characte
wearing military-grade armor.
At the same time, the vehicle must also resist damag
incurred from hitting the pedestrian. Determine damage as co
sion damage; the Damage Level is one stage lower than that lis
ed on the Impact Damage Levels Table for the vehicle spee
(For example, a vehicle moving between 1 and 20 meters p
turn would take no damage from the collision, while one mo
ing between 21 and 60 meters per turn would resist only Lig
damage.)
It's Saturday night, and Rex Karz and his pals are out
joyriding through the sprawl. Rex is having such a good
time that he's not paying enough attention to the road,
and suddenly his car is making a wide turn-smack into
* group of pedestrians standing on the sidewalk.
The car is traveling at 60 meters per turn, so the collision would normally cause Moderate damage according to the Impact Damage Levels Table. But this is a
vehicle-pedestrian collision, so for the pedestrians the

damage is Serious. The Power of the damage is 6 (60 + 10), for a final Damage Code of 6S.
Seems that cars ain't the only things Rex wrecks.
VEHICLE DAMAGE FROM WEAPONS
Whenever a player character fires a weapon at a vehicle, he
must specify whether he is shooting at the vehicle itself or at passengers inside the vehicle. The process for resolving damage from
the attack depends on the character's declared action.
Attacks Against the Vehicle
If a character is shooting at the vehicle itself, the weapon's
Damage Level is reduced by one level (D to S, S to M, and M to L)
to reflect the nature of the vehicle. Weapons with a Light Damage
Level cannot affect the vehicle, unless special ammunition is used.
Grenades and other explosives also face the same Damage Level
reduction, but anti-vehicle munitions (missiles, rockets, mortar
shells and so on) do not.
Vehicle armor reduces the Power of all attacks by its rating.
except for anti-vehicle (AV) munitions. If a weapon's standard
Power (unaugmented by burst or full-auto fire rates) does not
exceed the armor's rating, the weapons fire does no damage to
the vehicle.
Against AV munitions (weapons using a shaped-charged,
explosively-formed penetrating warhead specifically designed to
take out vehicles), their Damage Level is not reduced. The Power
of the AV munitions is only reduced by half the Armor Rating
(round down the Armor Rating before calculating the AV munitions Power).
To resist the damage, the vehicle's controlling player makes
* Damage Resistance Test for the vehicle. He rolls a number of
dice equal to the vehicle's Body Rating and may add any available
Control Pool dice. The number of Control Pool dice added may not
exceed the character's Driving Skill rating. The test target number
equals the modified Power of the weapons attack.
Compare the number of successes generated by both the
attacker and the vehicle and determine the damage. Standard
staging rules apply. If the attack does no damage and the number
of Control Pool dice exceeds the attacker's successes, the attack is
* complete miss.
Whenever a vehicle sustains Serious damage from a single
attack, the driver must make a Crash Test (see Crashing, p. 51).
When all the boxes on a vehicle's Condition Monitor are filled, the
vehicle automatically crashes.
If a vehicle has a Body Rating of O (as in the case of very small
drones), any success generated by the attacker automatically
destroys the vehicle.
Called Shots and External Components
To fire at a vehicle's external components (such as a tire,
antenna or vehicle weapon), a character must make a Called Shot
against the component. Do not change the Damage Code of the
attack (the standard effect of staging up a Called Shot is negated
by the vehicle's Damage Level reduction). Note that certain components, such as external fuel tanks, may have separate Body and
Armor ratings.
Normally, the attack must cause Moderate or higher damage
to the vehicle to destroy an external component. However, the
gamemaster may reduce this damage threshold to Light for fragile components, such as antennas, or increase it to Serious for
reinforced ones, such as weapon turrets.
Optional Terrain-Based Control Pool Dice Limits
The use of Control Pool dice on vehicle Damage Resistance
Tests simulates a driver's ability to maneuver his vehicle to reduce
the damage it takes from an attack.
If desired, gamemasters can take this one step farther and
apply the following terrain-based limits on Control Pool dice in
their games. These limits apply to Damage Resistance Tests and
reflect the various degrees of maneuverability afforded by different terrain.
CONTROL POOL DICE LIMITS
Terrain Type
Open, Normal
Restricted
Control Pool Dice Maximum
Character's Driving Skill Rating
Character's Driving Skill + 2 (round up)
Tight
Character's Driving Skill + 3 (round up)
ATTACKS AGAINST PASSENGERS
If a character is shooting at passengers inside a vehicle, the
passengers receive the benefit of protection from the vehicle.
Subtract either the vehicle's Armor or Body Rating, whichever is
higher, from the Power of the attack. Do not reduce the Damage
Level of the weapon, however. Passengers cannot use Combat
Pool dice to assist in their Damage Resistance Tests.
* targeted rigger who is jacked into a vehicle receives a +3
target modifier on his Damage Resistance Tests. (A rigger's consciousness is not focused on his body while he is jacked in.)
Any passenger attack with a Deadly Damage Level also inflicts
Light damage against the vehicle. The damage occurs at the same
time as the attack on the passenger and cannot be resisted.
VEHICLES AND MAGIC
Only physical spells, which produce physical effects, affect
vehicles. Mana spells do not affect vehicles, even if they are being
controlled by the living mind of a rigger. Likewise, mana spells
have no effect on a rigger jacked into a vehicle, unless the casting
magician can actually see the rigger. See Spells against
Characters in Vehicles, p. 54.
Spells cast against vehicles have a Target Number of 8, due
to the complex technological and electronic nature of a vehicle.
The vehicle's driver makes a normal Damage Resistance Test for
the vehicle, using the vehicle's Body. The target number for the
Damage Resistance Test equals the spell's Force modified by
armor. Magicians can allocate spell defense dice to protect a vehicle against such attacks.
If the casting magician's Spell Success Test generates more successes than the vehicle's Spell Resistance Test, the spell takes effect.
VEHICLE COMBAT
Vehicles are single, complete entities. A vehicle's wheels,
windshield, antenna and other accessories are interrelated components. Therefore, magicians cannot use magic to target individual portions of a vehicle. A single-target combat spell affects the
entire targeted vehicle and all of its components and accessories.
An area-effect spell affects the entire targeted vehicle, as well as
its passengers and cargo.
DAMAGING MANIPULATION SPELLS
Damaging manipulation spells create a physical effect, then
throw the manifestation of that effect around an area in a random,
unfocused manner. If compared to mundane weapons, damaging
manipulations function like standard high explosives, rather than
like anti-vehicle munitions, which direct the energy in a focused
manner to penetrate vehicle armor and mass bulk.
Damaging manipulation spells, therefore, are treated as normal weapons. Stage down the Damage Level by one step (D to S,
* to M and so on), and reduce the Force (or Power) of the spell by
the vehicle's Armor Rating. Unfortunately for the magician, this
means that the spell may have no effect even before it leaves his
or her hands.
COMBAT SPELLS
Combat spells, on the other hand, by their very intent, do target the vehicle and so are treated as anti-vehicle weapons. They
do not suffer the same reduction in Power Level as damaging
manipulation spells. In addition, since a combat spell attacks a
vehicle from the inside out, and thus bypasses the normal routes
of attack, the Force (or Power) of the spell is reduced by only half
the Armor Rating (because a combat spell's attack is through the
vehicle's aura, and since armor is an integral part of the vehicle,
armor does have a limited effect).
In other words, do not reduce the Damage Level of damage
from a combat spell, and only reduce the Force (or Power) of the
spell by half the vehicle armor, rounded down.
Because of their "inside-out" nature, combat spells will
always cause damage even if the vehicle's armor would reduce
the spell's force to 0. For example, if the Armor Rating is greater
than twice the Force of the spell, the player must still make a Spell
Resistance Test for the vehicle against a Target Number of 2
(Armor 4 + 2 = 2, and the Force of the spell is 2). Of course, if the
Force of the spell is reduced to 1, the target number for the Spell
Resistance Test would still be 2.
SPELLS AGAINST CHARACTERS IN VEHICLES
Magicians can use spells to selectively target passengers or
drivers of vehicles, provided that the magician has a clear line of
sight to his target. Motorcycle riders and drivers or passengers in
other open or open-topped vehicles are examples of vulnerable
targets. Similarly, any object that is not a part of the vehicle and is
visible can be targeted with a spell.
Drivers and passengers who are enclosed completely inside
* vehicle cannot be targeted with spells, because the vehicle
obscures them.
* spell, other than a damaging manipulation spell, will not
work unless the caster has a direct line of sight to his target; merely knowing someone is inside is not good enough. Nearly even
vehicle in the 2050s comes with adjustable tinted window
which allow the driver and passengers a full unrestricted view out of the vehicle, while blocking anyone outside from seeing in. Th
means a magician riding in a vehicle can cast spells through the
windows at targets outside, while remaining protected from
spells.
Nick Nightmare is roaring through the Seattle night
on his Aurora racing bike, with visions of barely legal
debauchery in his tiny mind. Unknown to Nick, a wiz-kid
mage has erected a barrier spell in Nick's path, and Nick
races blindly into it.
What happens next depends on what type of barrier spell the mage has cast. If it's a physical barrier spell,
both Nick and his Aurora crash into the barrier. Resolve
damage as if Nick had crashed his motorbike into a wall.
If the wiz kid casts a mana barrier spell, strange
things occur. The Aurora is an inanimate object, so the
spell does not affect it, and it races on into the night
unimpeded. Nick, on the other hand, is alive (at the time
of impact, anyway) and hits the mana barrier just as if he
hit a wall. Nick flies backward off his motorbike and takes
damage as if he had hit a wall with a Barrier Rating equal
to the spell's Force.
Now, suppose Nick was driving a Eurocar Westwind
2000. If the wiz kid casts a mana barrier spell, Nick and
the vehicle drive through without a scratch. In this case,
the aura of the sports car encloses and obscures Nick
from the wiz kid's line of sight, so the mana barrier has
no effect on Nick.
VEHICLE COMBAT
Of course, a magician outside an enclosed vehicle can get
around the line-of-sight problem by blowing out the vehicle's
Windows (or having his hired guns do so). Even so, this may not
completely solve the problem-it may fail to provide a sight line
or provide only a limited sight line that produces a +4 Partial
Cover target modifier for the Spell Test.
Individual gamemasters determine the exact effects of blowing out vehicle windows in such cases. As a rule of thumb, blowing out the windows of cars, trucks, buses and most other ground
vehicles provides unimpeded lines of sight to characters inside
the vehicle. Blowing out the windows of campers or other vehides with limited window space provides limited lines of sight; in
these cases, the +4 Partial Cover modifier applies. The visual slits
of an armored car are too small for anyone on the outside to look
In, so blowing out the protective glass is a waste of ammunition.
And finally, most armored personnel carriers use electronic camtras or reflective periscopes-so they have no windows to blow
out!
VEHICLES AND NATURAL DOMAINS
Vehicle drivers and passengers are considered to be in the
same natural domain as that of the vehicle in which they are traveling. Therefore, they are equally vulnerable to the powers of a
nature spirit as the vehicle itself. Shamans do not need lines of
sight to command nature spirits to use their powers against passengers inside a vehicle, provided that both the shaman and the
vehicle are in the spirit's domain. If a shaman leaves the spirit's
domain, she forfeits any remaining services the spirit owes her
(though the spirit will continue to carry out the last command
given it). Likewise, if the vehicle leaves the spirit's domain, the
spirit can no longer act against the vehicle or its passengers,
unless it is a great nature spirit or a toxic nature spirit (both of
which are capable of crossing domains).
Tricky, a Raccoon shaman, is fleeing on her motorbike from a couple of gangers chasing her in a Ford
Americar. Making a sharp hairpin curve at King Street,
she makes another hairpin turn and turns into a blind
alley. The gangers miss her second hairpin turn and go
roaring on down King Street. Tricky knows the gangers
will double back as soon as they realize their mistake, so
she decides to call for some help and summons a city
spirit.
Both Tricky and the gangers are on the city streets,
which puts them within the domain of the city spirit, so
Tricky orders the spirit to use its Fear power on the
gangers. Though Tricky can't see the gangers and has no
idea where they are, as long as they're out on the streets
the spirit will find them. Being inside the car is no help,
because the car is still within the domain of the city.
However, if Tricky decides to take a shortcut through a
building (a Hearth domain), she can no longer order the
spirit to act against the vehicle or its occupants.
Similarly, if the gangers decide to take a shortcut
through the city park (a Forest domain), Tricky cannot
command the city spirit to act against them while they
remain inside the park.
CASTING MAGIC FROM VEHICLES
The continually shifting motion of a moving vehicle makes it
difficult for a magician to achieve and maintain lines of sight to targets outside a moving vehicle.
To reflect this difficulty, add the following additional modifiers
to Spell Tests made by magicians attempting to cast spells from
moving vehicles against characters or objects outside the vehicle.

MOVING VEHICLE SPELL MODIFIERS TABLE
Moving in Open/Normal terrain	0
Moving in Restricted terrain	+2
Moving in Tight terrain	+4
Moving in a combat environment	+2

ASTRAL PROJECTION FROM VEHICLES
Though magicians can easily project while their meat bodies
are in motion, they may have problems returning to their bodies.
Unless the magician knows the vehicle's destination or travel
route, he will have to search for his physical shell (p. 146, SRII).
And even if the magician knows the vehicle's travel route, returning to his shell will take some time, and re-integrating his astral
and physical bodies is very difficult if his physical body is still in
motion.
Therefore, a moving magician must make an Intelligence (8)
Test to return to his body. If the test succeeds, the magician
returns to his physical body. If not, the astral form misses the
physical, and the magician must try again.
Remember that a character's normal movement speed in
astral space is his Astral Quickness Rating multiplied by 4. In many
instances, vehicles in the physical world can easily outpace astral
movement speeds, so magicians generally cannot follow vehicles
from astral space. (To do so, a mage would have to resort to his
fast movement rate, and at that rate magicians cannot see in sufficient detail to follow anything closely.)
VEHICLE GUNNERY
The vehicle gunnery rules are used to resolve fire from all vehicle-mounted weapons,
whether the weapons are being fired by gunners, by riggers jacked into vehicles or controlling drones, or by self-operating drones. Manual gunnery rules apply when characters fire
vehicle weapons without the aid of sensors. Sensor-enhanced gunnery rules apply when a
vehicle's sensors are used to aim vehicle weapons.
This section also provides rules for missiles and indirect-fire attacks.
MANUAL GUNNERY
Manual gunnery rules apply whenever characters fire personal or vehicle weapons with-'
out the aid of sensors. (Note that riggers jacked into vehicles may use the manual gunnery
rules to fire vehicle weapons.)
Though a manually aimed weapon may not be as accurate as a sensor-aimed weapon, the
manual aiming method does not increase the firing vehicle's Signature as does the sensoraiming method, and is not susceptible to ECM and ED.
Whenever a character manually aims and fires a weapon, the player makes a Manual
Gunnery Test. Standard Ranged Combat rules apply (pp. 87-92, SRII). However, the target
number modifiers listed in the Manual Gunnery Modifiers Table, p. 57, replace the standard
Ranged Combat modifiers (p. 89, SRII).

Smartlink: Smartlink modifiers apply
only if both the gunner and the vehicle
weapon are outfitted with smartlink
hardware. Smartlink Level I is the default
smartlink found in SRII. Smartlink Level II
is described in the Fields of Fire sourcebook and operates under special rules
and certain conditions (see pp. 84-85,
Fields of Fire).
Recoil Compensation: In addition to
any recoil compensation provided by
recoil-compensation accessories fitted to
* weapon, vehicle weapon-mounts also
provide recoil compensation. Pintle
mounts grant -2 recoil compensation;
ring mounts grant -6 recoil compensation. For weapons mounted on fixed
mounts and turrets, reduce recoil by half
(rounded down) before applying recoil
compensation provided by weapon
accessories. (Note that this compensation
cancels out the double-uncompensated
recoil modifier for heavy weapons (p. 89,
SRII)). See also Vehicle Weapon
Mounts, page 131.
Firing Unmounted Weapons: A +2
modifier applies if a character in a vehicle
is firing a weapon that is not mounted in
* vehicle mount. A common example of
this is a passenger leaning out of a window firing a handgun.
Attacking Drone Walking/Running:
These modifiers apply only if the drone is
propelling itself with mechanical legs.
Relative Motion: If the attacker and
target are moving toward each other (or
one is overtaking the other) reduce the
Motion modifier by 1. If the attacker and
target are moving away from each other
(or one is outrunning the other), increase
the modifier by 1.
Note that the Relative Motion modifier may not apply if both attacker and target are moving at roughly equivalent
speeds. If the attacker and target are
moving along the same axis of travel, the
modifier does not apply. If the attacker

ifiers are cumulative with character damage modifiers for Physical

Relative Speed: To determine the Relative Speed modifier for a
weapon attack, compare the speeds of the attacker and target. If
either vehicle's speed is less than 5 meters per turn, round the speed
up to 5; if both attacker and target are moving at speeds less than 5
meters per turn, treat the attack as standard Ranged Combat.
SENSOR-ENHANCED GUNNERY
Sensor-enhanced gunnery makes use of the vehicle's sensors
to improve the aiming of vehicle weapons. Though sensorenhanced aiming produces more accurate fire than manual aiming, sensor-enhanced gunnery is susceptible to ECM and ED.
Sensor-enhanced gunnery is also the aiming method used by
drones that are not directly controlled by a rigger.
To use sensor-enhanced gunnery, the attacking vehicle or
drone must first make a successful Sensor Test to detect the target with its sensors (see Sensor Test, p. 28). One success on the
Sensor Test is enough for a weapons lock. Making a Sensor Test
constitutes a Complex Action.
After the weapon has locked on to the target, the attacking
player makes a Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test. The player rolls a
number of dice equal to the character's Gunnery Skill plus half the
vehicle's Sensor Rating (round down). Combat Pool dice may be
added as well. Drones, when not controlled by a rigger, use their
Pilot Rating in place of the Gunnery Skill.
The test target number is equal to the target's Signature,
modified by the appropriate target modifiers from the SensorEnhanced Targeting Modifiers Table. Making a Sensor-Enhanced
Gunnery Test constitutes a Complex Action.
If the attacking vehicle's sensors cannot lock onto the target
for any reason, the attacker may not make a sensor-enhanced
gunnery attack.

Urban Environment: This modifier applies when comb
occurs in a major industrial area, such as a large city, industr
plant or other non-residential area of a sprawl.
Direct LOS: The Direct LOS modifier applies only if a cle
continuous straight line can be traced between the gunner and t
target, with nothing blocking the view. This generally occurs on
in ground-to-air and air-to-ground attacks. For ground-to-grou
attacks, this modifier applies only when the target is sitting
clear, open terrain.
Interrupted LOS: The Interrupted LOS modifier applies
most ground-to-ground attacks. In this case, a number of thin
(smoke, foliage, trash dumpsters) may block the line of sig
between the attacker and target.
ECM/ECCM in use: ECM modifiers increase the Gunnery T
target number by the number of successes the jammer has gener
ed on his Electronic Warfare Test. ECCM modifiers counteract Ed
successes and also require an Electronic Warfare Test. ECM a
ECCM modifiers apply only if the attacking vehicle is inside an E
field other than its own. See Electronic Countermeasures, p. 31.
ED/ECD in use: ED modifiers increase the Gunnery Test
get number by the number of successes the deceiver has gen
ated on his Electronic Warfare Test. ECD modifiers counteract E
successes and also require an Electronic Warfare Test. S
Electronic Deception, p. 32.
Recoil Compensation: In addition to any recoil compen
tion provided by recoil-compensation accessories fitted to
weapon, vehicle weapon-mounts also provide recoil compen
tion. Pintle mounts grant -2 recoil compensation; ring mou
grant -6 recoil compensation. For weapons mounted on for
mounts and turrets, reduce recoil by half (round down) bel
applying recoil compensation provided by weapon accessori
(Note that this compensation cancels out the double-uncomp
sated recoil modifier for heavy weapons (p. 89, SRII)). See
Vehicle Weapon Mounts, page 131.
Attacking Vehicle Damaged: If the attacking vehicle is da
aged, apply the appropriate damage modifier, based on
Damage Level on the Vehicle Condition,Monitor. Vehicle dama
modifiers are cumulative with character damage modifiers
Physical or Stun Damage. (See Vehicle Damage, p. 49.)
Steeler (Gunnery 4) is rigged into the Airstorm (a tbird with Sensor Rating 3 and a turret-mounted heavy
machine gun) and is providing air support for a column
of merc armored vehicles. As he clears the crest of a hill,
his sensors detect a Striker light tank patrolling the road
ahead. Steeler decides it's time for the Airstorm to pour
some lead rain on the tank's parade, so he makes a
Sensor Test to lock on to the tank.
The test succeeds, so Steeler decides to use sensorenhanced gunnery against the Striker tank. The base target number for the Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test is 3
(the targeted tank's Signature). If we momentarily ignore
modifiers for recoil, the target number receives a -3
modifier because the Airstorm has a direct line of sight
to the target. That produces a result of 0, which is round
VEHICLE GUNNERY
0
ed up to 2 because no target number can be less than 2.
Steeler's player rolls 5 dice for the test-4 for Steeler's
Gunnery Skill Rating of 4, plus 1 for the Airstorm's
Sensor Rating (3 + 2 = 1.5, which rounds down to 1).
Meanwhile, on the ground, Sgt. Juan, one of the
mercs Steeler is supporting, detects the Striker on his
vehicle's sensors and decides that Steeler shouldn't have
all the fun. Sgt. Juan must make his Gunnery Test against
* Target Number 3, however; he doesn't receive the
line-of-sight modifier because ground clutter and intervening terrain features partially obscure the Striker from
the sensors on Sgt. Juan's vehicles.
MISSILE COMBAT
Missile fire follows slightly different rules than standard sensor-enhanced gunnery, because missiles have their own smart circultry that allows them to alter their trajectories in mid-flight (and
slightly slows their flight times).
Before firing a missile at a target, the attacker must first
detect and lock on to the target with his vehicle's sensors using a
Sensor Test (p. 28). If the vehicle's sensors do not detect the target, missile fire will not strike it. One success on the Sensor Test
Indicates a lock.
After locking on to the target, the attacker makes a Missile
Attack Test using a number of dice equal to the character's
Gunnery Skill Rating, plus the missile's Intelligence Rating. Apply
all appropriate modifiers from the Sensor-Enhanced Targeting
Modifiers Table on page 58. ECM modifiers apply if the missile
passes through ECM fields during any part of its flight.
Unlike bullets and other small projectiles, missiles do not
travel at near-instantaneous speeds. All missiles reach their targets at the end of the Combat Turn (i.e., Combat Phase O, after all
players have completed all their actions), regardless of the
Combat Phase in which the missile is launched. Characters firing
missiles make their Enhanced Gunnery Tests during Combat Phase
0. Use standard damage rules to resolve missile damage to living
creatures. For missile damage to vehicles and inanimate structures, use the rules in Vehicle Damage from Weapons, page 53.
Note that the following missile-combat rules apply to missiles only. Rocket attacks are resolved with Manual Gunnery or
Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery rules because rockets do not have
Intelligence Ratings.
MISSILE FIRE MODES
Missiles may be fired in "continuous lock" mode or "fire-andforget" mode. Continuous lock mode requires the gunner to
maintain a positive lock on the target during the missile's flight.
Fire-and-forget requires a target lock only at the missile's launch.
Continuous Lock Mode
Continuous lock mode improves the chances of a hit but
restricts the firing vehicle's maneuverability, because the rigger
must maintain sensor contact with the target at all times.
Additionally, the rigger cannot attack other targets until the missile strikes at the end of the Combat Turn.
If a gunner chooses to fire a missile in continuous lock mode,
he may add half the Sensor Rating of his vehicle (rounded down)
to the missile's Intelligence Rating. However, all other Driving
Tests made during the turn receive a +2 target modifier.
VEHICLE GUNNER
Fire-and-Forget Mode
The fire-and-forget mode allows an attacker to fire at other
targets during the turn of the missile launch and to continue to
maneuver his vehicle without restriction. When firing a missile in
this mode, the attacker needs to establish a target lock only at the
time of firing. However, the attacker cannot add Sensor dice to the
missile's Intelligence.
INDIRECT FIRE
The indirect fire rule allows a drone, vehicle or shadowrunner
on the ground to acquire a target lock for a weapon that is in a different location. This enables a weapon to fire on a target when it
does not have line of sight to or a sensor lock on the target.
The indirect fire rule may be used with, drones, mortars and
Ballista missile launchers (see Fields of Fire), and other general
artillery weapons.
To use indirect fire, the spotter, weapon and rigger's remote
control deck must be equipped with the BattleTac Fire Direction
Data Manager (FDDM) (see New Toys, p. 136). Spotters can also
use other target designator devices such as laser sights and laser,
microwave and radar designators to lock on to targets for indirect
fire. (For more information on these devices, see p. 60, Fields of
Fire.)
Additionally, characters may take the new Indirect Fire
Concentration of the Gunnery Skill to increase their effectiveness
as spotters.
Resolving indirect fire is a two-step process. First, the spotter
(not the rigger or character who is firing the actual weapon) makes
an Indirect Fire Test to lock on to the target. If the spotter does not
have the Indirect Fire Concentration, he may use his Gunnery Skill,
but the test suffers a +2 target modifier.
The spotter rolls a number of dice equal to his Indirect Fire
Concentration (or Gunnery Skill Rating), plus half the Sensor Rating
of the missile (rounded down), plus the missile's Intelligence
Rating. The test target number is equal to the target's Signature
Rating. The spotter may not use Combat Pool dice for the test, but
gamemasters may manipulate the target number to reflect the
spotting device and weather conditions. See the Visibility Table (p.
89, SRII) for sample modifiers.
If the Indirect Fire Test fails, the missile cannot be launched
against the target. However, the missile may be used for an areaeffect attack (see Area-Effect Attacks). In any case, the test constitutes a Complex Action.
After the missile is launched, the spotter must keep the sensor or target designator locked on to the target until the missile
strikes at the end of the Combat Turn. During the turn, the spotter receives a +2 modifier to all other Success Tests. If the spotter
loses contact with the target, the missile scatters (see Area-Effect
Attacks). Characters using a target designator may attack with
another weapon, but they suffer the Second Firearm modifier
when doing so (see p. 90, SRII).
The second part of the indirect-fire process consists of a standard Missile Attack Test made by the attacking player (not the
spotting player). Apply all appropriate modifiers from the SensorEnhanced Targeting Modifiers Table (p. 58). ECM modifiers apply
if the missile passes through ECM fields during any part of
flight.
Combat Pool dice cannot be used on the Missile Attack T
but the attacker can add a number of dice equal to the number
successes generated on the spotter's Indirect Fire Test.
Molyneaux is a forward observer for a shadowrun
team making a run against a corporate research park. As
the team exits a building in the park, Moly spots a corporate armored transport moving in to cut off his
advance. Moly radios the team rigger, Tubbs, and
requests some fire support. Tubbs tells Moly to paint him
* target.
Moly pulls out a laser designator and points it at the
transport. To see if Moly gets a lock on the armored
transport, Moly's player rolls 6 dice (5 for Moly's Indirect
Fire Skill Rating of 5 and 1 for the Sensor Rating of the
anti-vehicle missile), against a Target Number 3 (the targeted armored transport has a Sensor Rating of 3).
Moly's Indirect Fire Test generates 3 successes, so the
target lock is achieved.
Tubbs immediately fires a laser-guided anti-vehicle
missile. To resolve the attack, Tubbs' player makes a
Missile Attack Test. The player rolls 13 dice (6 for Tubbs
Gunnery Skill Rating of 6, 4 for the missile's Intelligence
Rating of 4, and 3 for the 3 successes from Moly's
Indirect Fire Test.) The Target Number for the test is 6,
reflecting the Citymaster's improved Signature.
Area-Effect Attacks
Area-effect missile attacks occur in the following circumstan
* The spotter's Indirect Fire Attack Test fails and he can
lock on to the target
* The spotter cannot maintain the target lock until Phase
the turn
* The desired targets are spread over a wide area and nos
gle vehicle is targeted
* Targeted object or area has no Signature
* Attack is made without a target designator
Target numbers for Area-Effect Tests are listed in the Ar
Effect Target Numbers Table, p. 61. If no target designator
used to guide the missile, use the appropriate target number fr
the Vehicle Sensor Only row.
If the area-effect attack occurred because the spotter's tar
lock was interrupted after the spotter made a successful Indirect
Test, calculate the target number as if the spotter had used a ra
target designator. Successes generated on the Indirect Fire Test
not be used in the Missile Attack Test for damage in such cases
Indirect area-effect missile attacks always scatter. The scal
distance is determined by the range between the spotter's de
nator or the vehicle sensor and the target, as shown on the Rem
Gunnery Scatter Table, p. 61. To determine the exact scatter,
player firing the missile makes a Gunnery Test. Combat Pool
may be used on the test, but Sensor and Missile Intelligence
may not. Each success generated on this test reduces the sca
distance. For short- and medium-range targets, each suco

reduces the scatter by 4 meters. For long- and extreme-range targets, each success reduces the scatter by 15 meters. If the final

As the anti-vehicle missile takes out the transport, a
burst of gunfire from the left draws Moly's attention to a
squad of corporate troops advancing on his team from
250 meters away. Molyneaux radios Tubbs again and
asks for an anti-personnel missile this time.
Rather than locking on to one of the corporate
troopers in the group, Moly decides to target the
squad's center of mass. With Moly's laser designator,
the troops are at short range (Target Number 4).
Tubbs's player then makes a Gunnery Test to fire the
missile. The test generates only 3 successes.
The gamemaster determines the scatter (2D6 x 2),
which comes out to 16 meters. However, Tubb's Gunnery
Test generated 3 successes, so he can reduce the scatter by
* x 4 meters, or 12 meters. That means the missiles strike
* meters away from the squad's center of mass.
SIGNATURE
* vehicle's Signature Rating inciicates the vehicle's vulnerability to electromagnetic or thermal detection and its ability to.
evade or "fool" smart weapons.
The Signature Rating of a vehicle is used as the target number
for all attacks made against the vehicle with all "smart weapon" systems and sensor-enhanced weapons. Smart weapons are missiles
and vehicle weapons that are guided by a vehicle's sensors.
Because vehicle sensor systems include imaging and tracking
devices that compensate for variables such as range, target and
attacker's motion, most standard target modifiers do not apply.
However, sensors are vulnerable to electrical interference, electronic countermeasures and other factors, so target modifiers
related to these factors do apply. Applicable modifiers are listed
on the Sensor-Enhanced Targeting Modifiers Table (p. 58).
Signature Ratings for vehicles are provided in the Vehicle
List (p. 148).
SIGNATURES OF BIOLOGICAL FORMS
The base Signature Rating for humans and metahumans is 6.
Gamemasters may determine the Signatures of critters based on
their sizes. As a general rule, a critter that is three times larger
than a human has a Signature of 5. A critter that is six times larger than a human has a Signature of 4, and so on. Similarly, a critter that is three times smaller than a human has a Signature of 7;
* critter that is six times smaller, a Signature of 8 and so on.
Targets with high Signatures are more difficult to hit. Targets
with lower Signatures can be hit more easily.
Signatures for some common critters are listed on the Critter
Signature Ratings Table.

DRONES
Riggers can control unmanned vehicles (known as drones) via remote control networks.
Additionally, riggers can use remote control networks to control robots-drones equipped
with mechanical arms, legs and other specialized appendages. This section provides rules for
using drones and remote control networks.
Remote control networks also enable riggers to control building security systems. Rules
for this use of remote control networks are provided in The Security Rigger (p. 77).
REMOTE CONTROL NETWORKS
* remote control network consists of two fundamental elements: a remote control (RC)
deck and drones. The RC deck is the central control station, from which the rigger monitors
and directs the movements of drones connected to the network. The RC deck also maintains
the electronic integrity of the network by ensuring stable data flow and employing active
countermeasures to keep out unwanted intruders.
Because of the vast amount of data being transmitted over the airwaves, remote control
networks actually use three separate radio channels to command and control drones: the
command, simsense and system channels. For more information about how these channels
operate, see Electronic Warfare, p. 68.
SUBSCRIBER LISTS
An RC deck's subscriber list is a file that enables the deck to identify all the drones under its control. Only drones listed on an RC deck's subscriber list can connect with the deck. This helps protect the network from unwanted intruders who may attempt to intercept network communications and feed it false information or even seize control of the system (see Signal
Interception, p. 68).
* subscriber list can contain a number of drones equal to twice the RC deck's rating. However, a deck can actively control only a number of drones equal to its rating. All network drones operate under affiliated or non-affiliated status. Any drone that is under the direct control of an RC deck is affiliated with that deck. Affiliated drones can receive commands from the remote control deck and transmit data to it and to other affiliated drones.
* non-affiliated drone is operating independently of the RC
deck. Consequently, a rigger controlling a network can neither see
through nor control the non-affiliated drone. Additionally, the
non-affiliated drone cannot communicate with any other drones
in the network.
The act of affiliating or disaffiliating a drone requires a Simple
Action. Therefore, substituting a non-affiliated drone for an affiliated drone requires 2 Simple Actions or a single Complex Action
(1 Simple Action for disaffiliating the first drone and 1 for affiliating its substitute). A drone may not act during the Combat Turn in
which it is being affiliated.
Josie Cruise has a Rating 4 remote control deck. The
deck's subscriber list can hold transmission information
for up to eight drones, but the deck enables Josie to
actively control only four at any one time. Josie has six
subscriber drones on her list: her command van, an aerial surveillance drone, two armed aerial spotters and two
armed ground patrol vehicles (GPVs).
Currently, Josie is performing reconnaissance for her shadowrunner team. She's affiliated her command van, the surveillance drone and the two aerial spotters, which gives her team considerable aerial coverage. As the team makes its way into the main factory, one of the spotters detects a security response team bearing down on the runners. Josie decides to engage the security forces with some suppressive fire and buy her teammates a little more time. Rolling for Initiative, she generates a 19, which gives her two actions for the Combat Turn. She spends her first Simple Action disaffiliating her surveillance drone in favor of a GPV. She spends her second Simple Action affiliating the GPV, so she will be able to use the GPV during her next Combat Phase.
HARDWIRING A REMOTE CONTROL DECK
Hardwiring a remote control deck to a vehicle is the act of permanently affiliating the two components. Hardwiring a deck and vehicle provides three main benefits. First, a hardwired deck can draw power from the vehicle's alternator or battery to augment its internal power source. Second, a hardwired configuration provides the rigger with the protective benefits of the vehicle while she is jacked into the remote control network, and enables the driver to run the vehicle while jacked into the RC deck. Finally, a hardwired remote deck can increase its Flux Rating by half the vehicle's Body Rating, rounded down.
Vehicles must be adapted for rigger control and equipped with electronics ports (see Electronics Port, p. 139) before they can be hardwired to remote decks. Vehicles that are hardwired to decks cannot be disaffiliated.
See Vehicle Design and Customization, p. 126, for more information on adding a remote control deck to a vehicle.
DUMP SHOCK
Because vehicle control rig jacks are connected to riggers' middle brains, the effects of dump shock on riggers can be consideral more serious than the effects of dump shock on a decker.
Any time a rigger is dumped from a remote control network the following three conditions occur:
* The rigger must overcome the normal effects of disoriention for 10 Combat Turns.
* During the 10 turns, all of the rigger's Success Tests receive a +2 modifier.
* The rigger must also resist (RC deck Rating + 4)S Stun damage from neural biofeedback.
* rigger can reduce the duration of these disorienting effect by making a Willpower Test against a Target Number 4. Divide number of successes into 30 (round up) to determine the number of seconds she is disoriented, then divide that product by 3 (round up) to determine the number of Combat Turns the effects last.
ACTIONS
The following list describes possible actions a rigger can perform using a remote control deck.
FREE ACTIONS
Activate/Deactivate Sensors: A rigger may activate or deactivate sensors for a single drone. Activated sensors come on at the start of the next Combat Turn.
Activate/Deactivate ECM/ECCM: A rigger may activate deactivate ECM or ECCM for a single drone. Activate ECM/ECCM comes online at the start of the next Combat Turn
Arm/Disarm a Weapon System: A rigger may order a single drone to arm or disarm one of its weapon systems. Note the drone may have only one weapon system armed at any one time However, switching weapon systems only requires one Free Action
Delay Action: Per standard combat rules.
Call up a Status Report: A rigger may monitor the position heading and speed, damage report, and/or current orders
single drone.
Observe: A rigger may casually observe through one dre
If the rigger is in captain's chair mode (p. 65), he may do
through any drone on his subscriber list. If the rigger is "jump
into a drone-meaning that he is seeing and hearing prim
through that drone's systems-he may observe through that mary drone only. This action is the same as the standard Action Observe (p. 81, SRII).
If a rigger has jumped into a primary drone, observe through a secondary drone requires a Complex Action
Operative Modes, p. 65).
Speak a Word: Per standard combat rules.
SIMPLE ACTIONS
Affiliate/Disaffiliate a Drone: A rigger may add or dre
drone from the deck's active management.
Observe in Detail: A rigger may observe in detail (see p.
SRII) through any single drone while in captain's chair mo
While jumped into a drone, a rigger can do this with the prim
drone only.
Perform the Same Free Action on Multiple Drones: A rigger may perform one Free Action with two or more drones simultaneously while in captain's chair mode. However, he cannot perform two or more separate Free Actions.
Jump into a Primary Drone: A rigger takes direct control of
ane drone (see Operative Modes).
Return to Captain's Chair: A rigger stops maintaining direct
control of one drone and returns to monitoring the overall status
of all drones. (See Operative Modes.)
COMPLEX ACTIONS
Conduct Signal Interception: A rigger may attempt to wage
electronic warfare against a remote control network. For more
Information, see Signal Interception, page 68.
Conduct MIJI: A rigger may attempt to engage in advanced
electronic warfare using one of four possible methods: meaconIng. intrusion, jamming or interference. For more information, see
Mijl, page 69.
Fire a Weapon System: A rigger may fire an armed weapon
on any single drone. (See Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery, p. 58.) If
the nigger is directly controlling a primary drone, he cannot perform this action with a secondary drone. Riggers operating
through a cybernetic link can use their Combat Pool only with the
primary drone. See Operative Modes.
Issue a Command: A rigger may issue a command to a
drone or a group of drones. See Issuing Commands, page 66.
Intercept a Remote Control Channel: The rigger may search
the airwaves for a remote control channel being used by another
network. See Signal Interception, page 68.
Observe through a Secondary Drone: When directly controlling one drone, a rigger may casually observe (as in the Free
Action Observe) through a secondary drone. See Operative
Modes.
Operate a Drone: While jumped into a drone, the rigger may
operate it as if he was driving it. He can perform any of the five
standard vehicle actions-accelerating/braking, positioning, ramming and hiding-with the drone, and can use his Control Pool
and rigger bonuses. (See Vehicle Combat, p. 45.)
Reconnect a Lost Carrier: A rigger may attempt to re-estabIlsh a remote control channel lost through electronic warfare. See
Re-connecting Lost Carriers, page 72.
Regenerate Channel Degradation: A rigger may attempt to
use ECCM to purge one remote control channel of degradation
caused by MIJI. See Regenerating MIJI Degradation, page 72.
DRONES
Drones are unmanned vehicles that can be controlled via rigger networks, such as remote-control networks or security systems. Nearly any kind of vehicle-matchbox-sized cars, dwarfsized rotor crafts, ground patrol vehicles the size of a large dog,
even modified sports cars-may serve as drones.
The key difference that sets drones apart from ordinary vehides is a unique vehicle rating called the Pilot Rating. All drones
have a Pilot Rating, which represents the drone's self-piloting system and enables the drone to act independently of its controller
to a limited degree.
* drone must be adapted for rigger control (however, it need not be fitted with a datajack system unless the rigger intends to physically jack into the vehicle). All drones that are incapable of carrying passengers are automatically pre-adapted for rigger control. Passenger vehicles or larger passenger drones are not usually pre-adapted, but most can be adapted quickly by the manufacturer, a mechanic or even the rigger herself (see Vehicle Design and Customization, p. 118).
OPERATIVE MODES
All affiliated drones operate under primary or secondary mode.
* rigger may operate only one drone in her network on primary mode. This enables the rigger to control the drone as if she
was directly jacked into it. The rigger may use Combat and Control Pool dice when making tests for the drone and receives all rigger bonuses for those tests.
Success Tests for secondary drones are made with the drones' Pilot Ratings rather than the rigger's Skill or Attribute Ratings. Only IVIS Pool dice may be used for secondary drone tests. (For more information about the IVIS Pool, see The BattleTac
IVIS System, p. 67.)
If a rigger is jumped into a primary drone, the rigger can only casually observe through the sensors of her secondary drones, and she must spend a Complex Action to do so. Additionally, Comprehension Tests made by the secondary drones to comprehend commands suffer a +2 modifier if the rigger issues those
commands while she is running her primary drone. (See Issuing Commands, p. 66.)
Captain's Chair Mode
Instead of jumping into one drone, a rigger can supervise all the drones in her network via her remote control deck's master control. Riggers call this practice "sitting in the captain's chair."
When operating drones in the captain's chair mode, a rigger cannot use her Combat or Control Pool dice for drone tests.
However, the rigger may still use her Task Pool dice and still receives Initiative bonuses.
The captain's chair mode is the only drone-control method
available to characters who do not possess a VCR implant.
After barely escaping from an ambush while meeting with their Johnson, Rigger X and his team have hunkered down in a safehouse. Rigger X has deployed three
of his drones-a Condor surveillance drone, a Doberman
patrol vehicle and an armed spotter drone. Rigger X is
operating his network in the captain's chair mode, monitoring all three drones simultaneously.
The Condor detects a Mitsuhama security transport
closing on their location and beeps an alert to Rigger X.
Although he is in captain's chair mode, Rigger X receives
his usual Initiative bonus, which allows him to add 2D6
to his Initiative roll (and act first).
However, if Rigger X orders his drones to attack the
transport, neither drone can receive bonus dice from any
of Rigger X's dice pools. Further, both drones would use
their Pilot Ratings instead of Rigger X's Skill or Attribute
Ratings for their Success Tests.
The spotter drone is closest to the MCT transport, so
Rigger X jumps into that drone's rigger module and
makes the spotter his primary drone. Rigger X is now
directly controlling the drone, so he can draw dice from
his Control and Combat Pools to augment Success Tests
made with that drone. However, if Rigger X wanted to
see what another drone was seeing, he would have to
spend a Complex Action to do so. Also, if Rigger X
wanted to order the Doberman to attack the transport as
well, the Doberman would receive a +2 target modifier
on its Comprehension Test.
ISSUING COMMANDS
When riggers are jacked into remote control decks, they may
issue commands to drones at the same time that they declare their
own actions (Step 2B of the Combat Turn Sequence, p. 78, SI
Issuing a command to a drone requires one Complex Action.
* rigger can issue only one command to a single drone
regardless of how many drones his remote control deck is ma
aging at that time. For example, a rigger may be controlling te
drones, but he may directly command only one of them with
Complex Action. However, if more than one drone is receiving
identical command-"leave this area," or "attack this target,"
example-the rigger may command them as a group. The mal
mum number of drones that a rigger can command is dictated
the remote control deck (see Subscriber Lists, p. 62).
If a rigger has jumped into a primary drone, he controls
drone as if he was driving it personally. He does not have
spend a Complex Action commanding that drone to act, but
does have to spend a Complex Action to issue a command
another drone.
DRONES
* rigger can issue a drone one-sentence commands such as
"circle this area," "shoot anyone who comes through this door,"
"follow that car," and the like. The more specific and detailed the
command, the greater the chance the drone's pilot will become
confused, however. The gamemaster should rate the command's
complexity (using the Skill Success Table on p. 68, SRII), set the
target number for the test and give the rigger the option to downgrade the complexity before issuing the command.
The player then makes a Comprehension Test for the drone,
rolling a number of dice equal to the drone's Pilot Rating against
the target number. If the test generates at least one success, the
drone comprehends the command and executes it. However, the
more successes the test generates, the more leeway the drone
has in "interpreting" the command (to the rigger's benefit). The
gamemaster may even permit the rigger to decide what the
drone does in response to a circumstance that runs counter to the
rigger's instructions.
Additionally, riggers may use the Non-Matrix Programming
Specialization of the Computer Skill to help their drones understand commands, because the specialization teaches riggers how
to phrase complex commands in an orderly, logical fashion.
Riggers may add a number of dice equal to their level in this specialization to the drone's Comprehension Test. However, the
number of dice may not exceed the drone's Pilot Rating. No other
dice pools may be used for this test.
When making Success Tests, drones not directly controlled
by the rigger use their Pilot Ratings in place of the rigger's Skill or
Attribute Ratings. Drones do not gain the benefit of dice pools,
with the sole exception of the IVIS Pool (see IVIS Pool, below).
All drones in a remote control network act during the same
Combat Phase as the rigger acts, whether or not a rigger is directly controlling them. The rigger acts first, then all drones follow.
THE BATTLETAC IVIS SYSTEM
The BattleTac IVIS (Inter-Vehicle Information System) is an
extension of the BattleTac system. The basic BattleTac system
enhances small-unit tactics among a group of soldiers; BattleTac
IVIS (or simply "IVIS") does much the same for drones, and is
used in conjunction with the Vehicle Tactics Specialization of the
Tactics Concentration.
IVIS enables a rigger to give a complex mission to a group of
drones. All the drones in the group must possess IVIS software as
part of their Pilot programs.
IVIS Test
To use IVIS, the rigger makes an IVIS Test before making the
Comprehension Test for the group of drones. The player rolls a
number of dice equal to her Vehicle Tactics Specialization against
* Target Number 5. Skill Web modifiers (p. 48, SRComp) apply if
the rigger must default to the Tactics Concentration or Military
Theory Skill.
* rigger may use the successes generated by the IVIS Test to
add dice to the drone group's Comprehension Test, to create a temporary dice pool called the IVIS Pool, or both. For example, if
* rigger's IVIS Test generates 5 successes, she may add 5 dice to
the Comprehension Test or create a 5 dice IVIS Pool. She could
also split the result in various combinations-for example, adding
* dice to the Comprehension Test and creating a 3D6 IVIS Pool.
IVIS Pool
IVIS Pool dice are available to any drone within an IVIS group
and may be used on any action performed by those drones. IVIS
Pool dice refresh at the end of each Combat Turn until the drone
group completes the assigned task or receives a new task. At
either point, the IVIS Pool ceases to exist and the rigger must
make a new IVIS Test to form another IVIS Pool for another task.
IVIS Pool dice are not available to drones that a rigger has jumped
into.


ROBOTS
* robot is an advanced form of drone. Like standard drones,
robots possess a Pilot Rating, which represents the computer that
gives the robot its limited autonomy. Unlike drones, however,
robots contain advanced computer technology based on the
semi-autonomous knowbot-computer technology that allows a
robot to change its algorithm to adjust to new situations. In effect,
robots can "learn" and adapt their behavior to better fulfill their
mission requirements. To reflect this capability in game play,
robots have Dice Pools and Threat Ratings, which standard drones
do not possess. Robots may use Learning Pool dice and generate
their own Initiative.
Though they can act with limited autonomy, robots are not
true artificial intelligences. They have no self-awareness and cannot actually think for themselves. Robots cannot interface with the
Matrix, nor can anything from the Matrix affect them.
LEARNING POOL
* robot's Learning Pool is equal to its Pilot Rating. A robot
can draw dice from its Learning Pool to augment any Success Test
that a standard character would augment with Combat, Control or
Task Pool dice. As with those pools, the Learning Pool refreshes
at the start of each Combat Turn and at each phase in which a
robot can act.
Additionally, a robot equipped with BattleTac IVIS may also
draw dice from an IVIS Pool. Learning Pool dice are not available,
however, if a rigger is directly controlling the robot.
INITIATIVE
Because robots can learn and adapt, they need not act simultaneously with the rigger like standard drones. To reflect this
capability, robots have their own Reaction Ratings and generate
their own Initiative.
* robot's Reaction is equal to twice its Pilot Rating. The number of dice used is equal to the Learning Pool plus one, to a maximum of 4. Note that these dice are not Learning Pool dice and are not drawn from the Learning Pool. Additionally, no Learning
Pool dice can be used for Initiative Tests.
ELECTRONIC WARFARE
The open airwaves are the only means by which to remotely command and control the
drones within a network, which makes networks vulnerable to electronic warfare. Electronic
intruders can "jam" a network's signals and deny a rigger control over her drones, override
transmissions to and from drones, and mislead the rigger with false information.
Because of the special nature of the MSST (mobile subscriber simsense technology) system for remote control networks (the protocol remote-control decks use to communicate with their drones), the rules for electronic warfare against remote control networks differ from the
rules for electronic warfare against standard radios (p.184, SRII) and the Electronic
Countermeasures rules for Sensor Systems (see Electronic Countermeasures, p. 31).
Electronic warfare attempts may succeed to a variety of degrees. Unlike ECM, which
totally disrupts a radio signal, electronic warfare attempts may simply degrade the quality of
the net and make command and control more difficult, or they may allow an intruder to take
control of an opponent's drones. Complete signal disruption almost never occurs.
Electronic warfare is a two-step process. First, the intruder must intercept the signals of the
targeted network. Then the intruder may perform one of four more aggressive operations against
the network-meaconing, intrusion, jamming or interference-collectively known as MIJI.
SIGNAL INTERCEPTION
Signal interception is both a means to an end and an end in itself. The first step in conducting electronic warfare, it is a passive assault that allows the intruding rigger to know what
his intended target is doing before going on to more aggressive measures. Think of it as listening in on a telephone conversation-you may have no idea of who called whom or who is
doing the talking, but you can get all the information exchanged by the two parties on the
line. In a similar manner, signal interception allows an intruding rigger to eavesdrop on one of
his opponent's signal bands and pick up all the information being transmitted via that band.
Before an intruder can attempt electronic warfare operations against a network, he must
first intercept the radio frequencies on which his target is operating, which means locating the
airwave frequency of the target network's command, simsense or system channels. The com
And channel relays messages that direct the movements and
Mons of the drones, as well as situational information and intelpince between the remote deck and the drones. The simsense
dienel routes audio, visual and simsense data between drones,
deck and rigger. The system channel carries data that ensures
network Integrity and monitors drone status, and also routes data
or Indirect-fire attacks made with the network.
To Intercept any of these channels, the intruder must be withh range to transmit his own signals to the opposing remote conbol deck. Both the targeted deck and the intruder's jamming
device must be within the range of the least powerful device. (The
ninge of an electronic device depends on its Flux Rating; see Flux
Duing and Range, p. 30.)
IF that condition is met, the intruder may attempt the interception by rolling a number of dice equal to the rating of his
device (see MIJI) against a target number equal to the target's
Deck Rating plus 3. Player-character intruders may add Task Pool
dice to this test.
For each success generated on the test, the intruder intercepts one of the network's channels. If the character is not
attempting to intercept a specific channel, the gamemaster may
select which channel is intercepted.
DEFEATING DECK ENCRYPTION
Some paranoid riggers (aren't they all?) encrypt their decks.
Defeating encryption on an RC deck works differently than dealIng with an Encrypted System (see The Security Rigger, p. 80). If
the targeted deck is fitted with encryption devices, the intruder
must defeat the encryption before he can intercept signals. The
Intruder must make an Electronic Warfare Concentration Test
against a target number equal to the targeted deck's Encryption
Rating plus 4. The intruder may use Task Pool dice for this test. The
lest must generate a number of successes greater than half the
largeted deck's rating, rounded up; otherwise, the attempt fails.
If the attempt to defeat encryption fails, the targeted rigger
Realizes that someone is trying to intercept his transmissions and
places his network on alert. Apply a +2 target modifier to all subsequent Interception Tests made against the network, including
my MIJI attacks. This modifier is cumulative with each unsuccessfol attempt to defeat encryption. If the test was successful, then
te targeted rigger does not know someone is listening in on his
deck's signals.
* rigger may outfit his deck with a decryption device (see
New Toys, p. 98). In such a case, he adds that device's Rating in
de to his Electronic Warfare Concentration Test.
M.C. Jammer (Electronic Warfare 7) is trying to intercept the system channel of a remote control network
controlled by an Aztechnology rigger with a Rating 6
remote control deck.
To identify the frequency of the channel, Jammer
rolls 5 dice (Jammer has a Rating 5 deck) against a Target
Number 9 (the Azzie has a Rating 6 deck, plus 3).
Jammer's test generates 1 success, so he locates the
Azzie's system channel.
But before he can intercept the signal on the channel, he has to defeat the deck's encryption. The target
number for the Electronic Warfare Concentration Test is 8
(the Azzie deck's Encryption Rating 4, plus 4 equals 8).
Jammer has to achieve at least 3 successes, because the
deck's Rating is 6 and half of 6 is 3. Jammer's player
decides to add all 4 of his Task Pool dice to the test. That
gives him 11 dice for the test (7 dice for his rating in
Electronic Warfare, plus 4 Task Pool dice).
Jammer's test generates 3 successes, so he breaks
the Aztechnology encryption. Had his test generated
only 1 or 2 successes, however, the Azzie rigger would
have been tipped off to the attempt, and the network
would have gone on alert. Consequently, the target
number for Jammer's next attempt would have increased
by 2, to 10.
If the interception attempt succeeds, the intruder locates the
appropriate channel and can read any data being carried over that
channel by spending a Complex Action.
If the intruder intercepts the simsense channel, the intruder
can see, hear and sense anything that the targeted network's
drones are monitoring with their sensors. If the intruder intercepts
the system channel, he can instantly get information on the position, direction of travel, ammunition and damage status of any
single drone in the network. Intercepting the command channel
allows the rigger to overhear commands being issued from the
opposing rigger to the drones in that rigger's network.
However, each time an intruder spends an action in this manner, he runs the risk of discovery. Any time the intruder takes such
an action, the gamemaster makes a Success Test for the targeted
network using a number of dice equal to the targeted deck's rating against a target number equal to the intruder's Electronic
Warfare Concentration. If the test succeeds, the network detects
the intruder, goes on alert and switches all of its frequencies and
prefix codes. The intruder must make another Interception Test to
intercept the network's transmissions, this time with a +2 target
modifier.
MIJI
MIJI (pronounced "mee-jee") is an acronym that stands for
meaconing, intrusion, jamming and interference. Intrusion, jamming and interference are self-explanatory. Meaconing allows a
rigger to introduce false signals into another rigger's network. It
affects drones in much the same way a confusion spell affects a
person. In each case, the intruder disrupts the targeted deck's
transmissions and sends false signals to the network's deck and
drones.
To perform one of these electronic warfare operations, the
intruder and the targeted rigger make a MIJI Test-an opposed
Success Test. The intruder rolls a number of dice equal to his
device's Flux Rating against a target number equal to the target
deck's rating. The targeted rigger rolls a number of dice equal to
his deck's Flux Rating. If the intruder is attempting meaconing,
intrusion or interference, the targeted rigger makes his test
against a target number equal to the intruder's Protocol Emulation
ELECTRONIC WARFARE
Module Rating. If the intruder is attempting to jam the targeted
network, the rigger makes his test against the ECM Rating of the
intruder's device. (For more information on the protocol emulation module, see New Toys, p. 98.)
Both the intruder and the targeted rigger may use Task Pool
dice for these tests.
If the targeted rigger wins, the network's channels remain
open and clear. If the intruder wins, he inflicts damage in the form
of signal degradation on the network. This degradation is recorded on the network's Signal Monitor, in the same way character
damage is recorded on a character's Condition Monitor. Each success on the opposed test produces one box of signal degradation
on the targeted network's Signal Monitor.
The specific operation attempted-meaconing, intrusion,
jamming or interference-determines which channel of the network experiences the degradation. As the degradation level of a
channel increases, target number modifiers are applied to all tests
for actions controlled by the degraded channel. When all the
boxes of a channel's Signal Monitor are filled, the intruder effectively shuts out the remote control deck and can assume control
of operations performed by that channel.

MEACONING
In a meaconing attack, an intruder attempts to degrade the
targeted deck's command or system channel integrity and introduce false system signals into the targeted network to degrade
the Pilot Ratings of the network's drones.
To perform a meaconing attack, an intruder must have a
remote control deck equipped with a protocol emulation module.
The intruder and the targeted rigger then make a MIJI Test as
described above.
Degradation modifiers generated by a successful meaconing
attack apply to Driving Tests, Gunnery Tests and tests for other
physical actions made with a drone's Pilot Rating, as well as
IVIS Tests. They do not apply to Comprehension Tests made
drones trying to understand commands from the targeted rigs
nor to drones directly controlled by a rigger.
Trixie is providing rigger cover for her shadowrunner team as they exit a corporate compound. When several security drones suddenly attack them, Trixie decides
to use her remote control deck to make a meaconing
attack against the security network and reduce the
drones' capabilities.
The first thing she needs to do is make a Signal
Interception Test. Trixie has a Rating 6 remote control
deck (Flux Rating 8), while the corporate remote control
network uses a Rating 3 remote control deck (Flux Rating
5). Trixie is in range, so she rolls 6 dice (her deck's rating) against a Target Number 6 (the corp network's rating of 3 + 3). She adds three Task Pool dice and generates 1 success. The gamemaster determines that Trixie
intercepts the system channel, which is all she wanted to
accomplish for her meaconing attack.
Trixie then rolls 8 dice (her deck's Flux Rating)
against a Target Number 3 (the corp network's rating) for
her half of the opposed MIJI Test. The gamemaster, making the test for the corp rigger, rolls 5 dice (the corp rigger's Flux Rating) against a Target Number 6 (Trixie's
deck rating).
Trixie's test generated 5 successes, while the corp
network generated only 1. That gives Trixie a Success
Margin of 4, so the gamemaster marks off 4 boxes on
the corp network's system channel, which results in
Moderate degradation. The corp drones now receive a
+2 modifier to any actions they take against the shadowrunners.
INTRUSION
In an intrusion attack, the would-be intruder attempts to
false information into the targeted remote control network.
information could be a false target for indirect fire on the sys
channel, bogus intelligence on the command channel, or eve
forged simsense clip on the simsense channel.
To attempt an intrusion, the intruder must possess a rem
control deck and a protocol emulation module (for generating
false objects). Intrusion may be directed at a network's syst
command or simsense channel.
If the intruder prevails in the MIJI Test, he creates the app
priate bogus object on the targeted network's appropriate di
nel. The targeted rigger will believe the object is real unless
rolls at least 2 successes on a Perception (3) Test. Apply
appropriate degradation modifiers.
* successful Perception Test enables the targeted rigge
recognize the object as bogus, but his drones will continue
regard it as real until he dispels the illusion by blocking the in
sion with ECCM (see Electronic Countermeasures, p. 31).
If desired, an intruder may create a more convincing computer-generated bogus object before making his intru
+3TN *
attempt. The intruder must have a computer and spend 1D6 + 1
hours to do so. The intruder makes an Open Success Test with his
Computer Skill (or Non-Matrix Programming Specialization). Use
the test result as the target number for the targeted rigger's
Perception Test.
Josie Cruise (Computer 3) is flying her team in on
her helicopter Angelfire. The team is making its way to
an isolated Cross Technologies laboratory in Tenino, just
outside the Seattle metroplex limits. Josie is bringing her
team in from the north, so she decides to make an intrusion against the lab security network's system channel
and generate a false radar contact to the south to distract
the lab's air-patrol drones. Josie makes a successful
Signal Interception Test, so she manages to intercept the
system channel.
Josie was expecting the drones, so before the run
she spent some time on her computer generating images
of enemy drones flying just above the treetops. She
makes her Open Computer Test and generates a result of
8.
The opposed MIJI Test pits Josie and her onboard
remote control deck (Rating 5, Flux 8) against the lab's
remote-control security system (Rating 4, Flux 6). Josie
rolls 8 dice against a Target Number 4, while the
gamemaster rolls 6 dice against a Target Number 5. Josie
generates 5 successes, while the lab network generates
3. so Josie wins the test by 2 net successes.
Consequently, the lab's patrol drones fly off to the south,
leaving no one to intercept Angelfire as it approaches
from the north.
Additionally, the gamemaster marks off 2 system
channel boxes on the lab network's Signal Monitor. That
results in Light degradation. As a result, the lab's rigger
must generate 2 successes on a Perception Test against
* base Target Number 8 (the result of Josie's Computer
Test) to recognize that the enemy drones are not real. A
+1 target modifier for Light degradation applies to the
test as well.
JAMMING
In a jamming attack, the intruder uses electronic countermeasures (ECM) to flood the targeted network's channels with
electronic noise-crude, but effective. The intruder must possess
ECM in addition to a remote control deck to make a jamming
attack.
If the intruder succeeds in the MIJI Test, his ECM floods one
of the targeted network's channels with electronic noise and
degrades its signal quality. The intruder decides which channel is
targeted; the effects of the jamming vary with each channel.
Command Channel
Command channel jamming causes degradation to command channel signals and adds degradation target modifiers to
drone Comprehension Tests (see Issuing Commands, p. 66) and
MIS Tests. If all 10 boxes on the command channel Signal Monitor
ELECTRONIC WARFARE
are filled, the drones are cut off from the network. They either
carry out the last command given to them or maintain a holding
pattern where they are. taking action only in self-defense.
Simsense Channel
Simsense channel jamming causes degradation to simsense
channel signals and adds degradation target modifiers to all
Perception Tests and Manual Gunnery Tests made by the rigger
through the drone.
If a rigger is remotely rigging a drone through the deck,
degradation modifiers on the simsense channel affect the rigger's
target numbers and penalize Initiative in the same way as standard damage modifiers. If a rigger is jumped into a drone or RPV
when the carrier signal is lost (meaning that all 10 boxes are filled
on the simsense channel Signal Monitor) for that drone, the rigger
also suffers dump shock (see Dump Shock, p. 64).
System Channel
System channel jamming disrupts a network's indirect fire
coordination and affects the performance of its BattleTac Fire
Direction Data Manager system (New Toys, p. 97). Degradation
modifiers from the system channel Signal Monitor apply to
Indirect Fire Gunnery Tests made with the network (see Indirect
Fire, p. 60).
INTERFERENCE
In an interference attack, the intruder attempts to override
the targeted network with his own signals. If the attempt succeeds, the intruder literally hijacks the network from the targeted
rigger's control.
To make an interference attempt, the intruder must possess a
remote control deck with a protocol emulation module.
Interference affects the targeted network's system channel only; it
has no effect on the command or simsense channels.
The interference MIJI Test works a bit differently than other
MIJI Tests. Specifically, the intruder's own system channel suffers
degradation if he loses the test.
In the Combat Phase following the first MIJI Test, either the
intruder or the defending rigger may spend a Complex Action to
make an interference attack or counterattack and trigger another
MIJI Test. The players may make subsequent attacks and counterattacks until one of them manages to inflict 10 boxes worth of
degradation on his opponent's system channel, or until a rigger
exits the system. Whichever player achieves the required amount
of damage first-or stays in the system after his opponent has
exited-takes control of the opponent's entire network. The loser
is shut out of the network and suffers dump shock (see Dump
Shock, p. 64).
M.C. Jammer is using his remote control deck
(Rating 5, Flux 7) to make an interference attack after a
successful Signal Interception against an Aztechnology
remote control network (Rating 6, Flux 4).
For the opposed MIJI Test, Jammer's player rolls 7
dice against a Target Number 6. The gamemaster rolls 4
dice against a Target Number 5. Jammer generates 1
success, while the gamemaster gets none. The
gamemaster fills in 1 degradation box on the Azzie's
system channel Signal Monitor.
During the next Combat Phase, the Aztechnology
rigger spends a Complex Action to counter the interference attempt. Jammer generates no successes on the
opposed MIJI Test this time, but the gamemaster scores
* successes for the Azzie rigger. Jammer fills in 2 degradation boxes on his system channel Signal Monitor.
After two more interference tests, the Aztechnology
rigger has 8 degradation boxes filled on his system channel Signal Monitor, while Jammer has 6 boxes filled on
his own monitor. Jammer makes another interference
attack, and both sides roll dice for the MIJI Test.
Jammer's player rolls 4 successes, while the gamemaster
gets none. That fills the remaining degradation boxes on
the system channel of the Azzie rigger's Signal Monitor,
so the Azzie rigger is dumped from his system. Jammer
takes control of the network and immediately commands its drones to attack the Aztechnology guards.
REGENERATING MIJI DEGRADATION
Riggers may use ECCM to "heal" signal degradation cause
by MIJI attacks and restore channel integrity.
To do so, the rigger must spend a Complex Action and ma
an ECCM Test against a target number equal to the intruder
device rating (either the intruder's deck or ECM rating, whiche
is higher) plus 3. Task Pool dice may be used on the test. For ev
* successes generated, reduce the degradation on the selec
channel by 1 box on the channel's Signal Monitor. Riggers m
regenerate only one channel at a time.
RE-CONNECTING LOST CARRIERS
When a remote control deck loses a channel because of M
degradation, it loses the channel's carrier signal. To access
channel again, the deck must re-connect the carrier signal
that channel.
Before attempting to re-connect a lost carrier signal, the
ger must first make an ECCM Test to regenerate any signal deg
dation and clear boxes filled on the Signal Monitor. At least
box must be clear before the rigger can attempt to re-connect
carrier signal.
Then the rigger makes a Control Systems Concentration
Test. If any degradation still exists on the channel, apply appro
ate degradation modifiers. Any damage modifiers for Physical
Stun damage suffered by the rigger apply as well. If the number
successes exceeds the number of filled degradation boxes on
channel's Signal Monitor, the re-connection attempt succeeds.

THE DUELISTS
* Sysop: You are in the War Stories room.
* Sounds like one helluva run, Jo.

* Josie Cruise
(pop/fwsshhh/gluglugluglug) Bought and poured, Jo-girl. Spill.
* Hellcab
* I'll trust you for one in the meatworld (fool that I am ... ). Okay. I was in Calfree last spring,
part of a team pulling a job on Yamatetsu. The corp had a hush-hush R&D compound up in
the Northern Crescent, not far from Blue Lake. Our Johnson thought they were up to something
biogenetically questionable (to put it nicely), and wanted us to get two kinds of proof: data
and a sample. Get in, snatch the goodies and get out again-my specialty.
So we headed out from Redding, got as near to the compound as we could by off-roader, then bailed and started hoofing. I'm not going to bore you with the rigger's-eye-view of the
ride up; half the folks on this board know what that's like, and anyways nothing happened. The
fun stuff all came later.
Our Johnson was amazingly well-informed about the place she'd sent us to hit, so we had
* pretty fair idea of where its defensive perimeter was. Yamatetsu had built the place in a little hollow between two hills-half inside the northernmost hill, to be exact. So we hunkered
down just shy of the top of the southmost hill, and I called up a couple of Condors to go have
* look-see.
You gotta love a Condor LDSD-23. Especially when it answers to a cranial remote deck. I
got to try out almost all my new toys on this run ... but I'm getting ahead of myself. Anyways,
for those few of you who don't know, the Condor's damned near
the ultimate stealth drone. It soars up on its little balloon and
sleazes right by a whole mess of sensors and radar, and not one of
them sniffs a thing. My remote deck let me see the world through
the drone's eyes, giving me as clear a picture of the compound's
perimeter defenses as if I'd walked straight up to the fence and
stuck my nose through it. Better, actually. The naked meat eye
doesn't give you thermo or infrared unless you're the right
metatype, and the metahuman nose can't chemsniff half as well
as the chemical sensors my Condor was packing.
The Condor showed me about what I'd've expected from a
hush-hush R&D compound-security was tight enough to safeguard the important drek inside, but nowhere near impossible. In
* place like the Northern Crescent, if you're setting up secret shop
and don't want to attract attention, you really can't afford to
dress up the outside of your research playground with every single
bell and whistle ever thunk up by Ares Macrotech and KnightErrant and other purveyors of paranoiac pacifiers. You have to
pick and choose, and layer your defenses. So I knew that getting
the team through the perimeter was only going to be half the battle. Once I'd managed that, I'd have to take over the building's
systems if I could-which meant going head-to-head with the
security rigger we'd been told was there, probably. I was looking
forward to it; things'd been kind of slow lately.
But first things first. The compound had a fence around the
three sides that weren't under the hill, with tall skinny pillars spaced
intermittently across it that I recognized as sensor posts. Motion
and infrared, most likely. Through the fence I could also see Ferrets
and Dobermans and even a couple of Guardians crawling along,
patroling the perimeter a lot more tirelessly and efficiently than
meat guards would've done. (Cheaper, too; a drone doesn't
need pay or health benefits and never takes personal time.) There
were also gun emplacements, on the two fence corners and lined
up across the roofline of the building. Sentry guns; I could tell by
the shape. Not the mobile kind on a track, though. Likely they'd
reserved those and the Sentry Ils for inside.
So I had my work cut out for me. I had to take out the sensor
posts, drones and Sentries all in one shot, so the rest of the team
could get up to the fence and through it without getting cut down
by a hail of lead. Also without being spotted. The sec-rigger would
know something was going down the minute I started to muck
with his system, especially considering the level of mucking that
was clearly going to be necessary-but the longer we could keep
the opposition from knowing exactly what they were up against,
the more time we'd buy for ourselves. And our job wouldn't take
us that long.
* called my eye-in-the-sky back and whistled up three more
drones. These had special jobs to do. Two of them were remoteadapted Artemises loaded with Jabberwockies, primed and
ready to fire. The third drone, which I sent in first, was my favorite
new toy: a Hedgehog signal interceptor, the very latest in seeingeye techno-beasts.
* Where in the name of the Great Ghost did you get a
Hedgehog ?! I thought the Azzies put a tight lock on distribution.
They went to a lot of trouble to develop that puppy; they sure
drek don't want street scum like us getting ahold of them. Who
you do, sell your soul to Old Scratch or something?
* Nissan Barb
Fell off the back of a t-bird, my fixer said. When somebody it
offers me a new piece of wizbang tech, I don't ask too m
questions. The important thing is, I got it, and I used it when I ne
ed it. Now don't interrupt my story; I'm on a roll here, 'kay?
The Hedgehog's a terrific piece of equipment. No rigger
can afford one should be without it, I don't care who you have
frag over or go to bed with. What this pup does, it tells you the
nal strength, protocols and encryption that a system is using
other words, the Hedgehog gave me the key to the compour
entire electronic security system just by reading the kinds of sig
flowing through those sensor posts. Giving me the shape ands
and taste of it, so to speak. (Not literally-but sometimes it's
to put what a rigger gets from a drone into words that ordin
people can understand.) All this stuff was vital information the
make the second half of my job-taking over the building
tem-that much quicker and easier.
Its job done, the Hedgehog crawled back. I shut it down
told the Artemises to fire their payload in ten seconds, then
them soaring toward the fence. And braced myself against
hillside so I wouldn't fall over, because I knew I'd get it when
Jabberwockies hit. A Jabberwocky is a jammer missile, which
perses transponders instead of a warhead. The transponder
nals frag up sensors, remote-control transmissions, you name
* fifty-yard or wider radius around the point of impact. So
ever disruption they caused, the Artemises they rode on would
nailed by it too. And since I was talking to the Artemises via red
deck, I knew I'd feel the backlash until I broke the link. But
meantime, all those sensors and perimeter drones and ever
seeing-eyes on the Sentry guns'd be blind and deaf and a
Which meant no security rigger was going to spot my team
ting through the fence and inside.
* Jeez. Why not just walk up to the front gate and shout hello
take out such a huge chunk of a rigged building's securi
tems, the rigger's gonna know the place is under attack. No
can you pass that off as a malfunction, or a hair-trigger
tripped by a high wind.
* Silent Running
* You missed a paragraph somewhere, didn't you? My
knew fragging well we were tipping corpsec off-but as la
they didn't know how big the threat was or exactly where
coming from, all they could do was chase their tails. We figu
be in and gone before they twigged enough to matter. A
were right.
* counted down in my head, then watched the work
black and go dizzy for a few seconds until I closed off the lin
the Artemises. I felt the rest of the team run by me, over the h
down. While the mage tended to the magical barriers an
sams chopped through the wire, I crawled backward just en
THE DUELISTS
to be completely out of range of Jabberwocky spillover, then
called up the rest of my drone network. Wandjinas with
Vanquishers mounted on them, these were; fast and deadly, just
the thing for taking out perimeter drones. And I had to do that,
both to keep myself safe once I started monkeying with the sensor
port's datalines and also to keep the drones from bothering my
buds on their way back out. The Jabberwocky jamming'd only
keep the drones blind and deaf for so long; once it started to wear
aff, all those Ferrets and Dobermans and Guardians with their little
turet guns would pose quite the nasty problem. Unless my
Wandjinas took care of them first.
It's a weird, weird feeling, seeing through the eyes of half a
dozen drones at once. Kind of like what I imagine bug eyes must
be like-all those facets showing you overlapping pictures. Except
that In my case, the pictures were different instead of the same
Image from different angles. To run a network like that through a
cranial remote deck-or any kind of wiring, for that matteryou've got to be good at multi-tasking. If you can't concentrate
on a dozen things at one time before breakfast, then don't even
try this stuff. You'll just make yourself sick trying to track everything,
and somebody else'll have to risk her hoop bailing you out of trouble. I don't have a problem with it; but then, I was the kind of kid
who liked looking at those crazy optical-illusion prints with the
upside-down staircases and stuff. I sent my Wandjinas around the
edges of the Jabberwockies' area of effect-couldn't send them
through it, or they'd be as blind as the sec-drones they were hunting-and waited for a clear target.
Then came the first sign of trouble. A pair of Condors
appeared, floating high and distant over the top of the compound.
Nuyen to noodles they were outside Jabberwocky range. They
weren't mine, so I knew they could only have come from one
source. The sec-rigger'd figured out that Something Big was up, and
had sent a couple of spies to find out what the frag was going on.
Well, I'd expected that. Not quite so soon, though; when I
Inaly got to tangling mano a mano with this guy, he was going to
be good. The enemy Condors weren't armed, so I ignored them
and got on with the primary task: nailing the daylights out of the
binded perimeter drones, some of which were still spinning
around in crazed circles. At first my Wandjinas made short work of
hem. After awhile, though, I saw some of the ones that'd stopped
dead starting to move-sluggishly, but with purpose. They were
getting out of the Wandjinas' line of fire, and a couple of
Guardians were even starting to swing their turrets back and forth.
Bod news for me-either the Jabberwocky effect was wearing off
or the sec-rigger was using a little ECCM to overcome the
Jabberwocky interference. Either way, it meant I didn't have
much time. I had to take over the building system before the
perimeter drones recovered, or I'd be their sitting duck.
* slung my duffel bag over my shoulder and ran up to the
nearest sensor post. The access panel was easy to spot; I blew the
bock on it with a short strip of acid solder, then pulled a decryption
module out of the duffel. Tech-heads like me use this little handheld meter doohickey to analyze and decrypt CCSS protocols. My
Hedgehog had already told me the system was encrypted, which
let me bypass the usual step of plugging in a protocol emulation
THE DUELIST
module and using it to figure out what was there. Took lots less
time this way, which was vital on this particular run.
* found the junction box and carefully opened the cover plate,
exposing the optic cables and electrical wires inside. Then I took out
my microtronics kit and delicately spliced my own leads into the system. As I started to connect the free ends of the splice into the
decrypt module, I felt a bullet punch me in the side and flatten itself
against my armor. The sec-rigger had managed to get at least some
of his toys working again. I had to take care of them before jacking
into the building system, or they'd take care of me. Lucky thing I'd
brought along a signal amplifier.
The output from the signal booster let me call the Wandjinas
in closer, within the range of the fading Jabberwocky interference. Thank the Ghost in the Machine for those boosters, and for
the Battletac IVIS system some bright tech so recently came up
with. Makes a combat-drone network sooo much easier to deal
with ... and leaves part of a rigger's mind free to take on another
job, like connecting illicit wiretaps and turning on a decrypt module. The 'jinas took out a Ferret and a Guardian that were far too
close for comfort. Now, I thought, and jacked in.
Overriding a security rig is a tough job. Unlike decking, you
can't rely on a clever bag of tricks to outwit any IC or other deckers you happen across. Instead, it's a pure battle of wills between
you and the sec-rigger. The toughest mind wins; the loser usually
ends up brain-fried or dead.

* Just for the record, decking into a system is NOT easy. And I resent any implication to the contrary.
* E-slipper
* Didn't mean to rile you, E. I didn't say decking was easy. But it is different than the way a rigger taps into a system. I just wanted to get that point across.
And now back to our feature presentation

* flood of images and voices surrounded me, as if I'd invaded someone else's brain (which, in a way, I had). I built a mental wall around myself as fast as I could, then formed a fist of pure willpower and struck out hard at the source of the flood. I felt an echo of dizzy pain as the blow connected-then a wallop, much
more immediate and powerful enough to send my virtual self
sprawling on my hoop. The sec-rigger was fighting back-and as
I'd guessed, he was no slouch in the battle-of-wills department. I
could feel the shape and weight of his virtual body, saw the two
of us locked together in a wrestling hold. One or the other would
have to give, and I was determined it wouldn't be me.
Distantly, as if my meat body belonged to someone else, I felt
the impact of more bullets against my heavy armor. I ordered my
Wandjinas to redouble their assault. A few seconds later I felt the
sec-rigger reel away from me, and I knew that one of my drones
had blown up one of his. Impressive that he'd managed to hang
in; half the time, a direct hit on a drone you're controlling will dump you right out of the system. It isn't only deckers who have to
worry about dump shock.
The next minute, that worry hit me over the head with all
subtlety of a tire iron. A Guardian got off a lucky shot that took
one of my Wandjinas, and the resulting nasty feedback damn
near made me black out from pain. But I couldn't afford to bio

of them fired. My little encryption trick had slowed the sec-rigg
response time dramatically while he tried to sort out just what
frag I'd done. Now I had time to shake off the not-quite-dun
shock and sneak up on the fragger.

Then his collapse speeded up. He was trying to wriggle ou

THE SECURITY RIGGER
Security riggers use closed-circuit simsense systems (CCSS) to control the security systems of entire buildings or facilities via remote technology. The closed-circuit system gives the
rigger control of all drones patrolling that site and enables him to automatically sense any event that the site's security sensors detect.
ACTIVE SECURITY RIGGERS
When a security rigger jacks into a CCSS and becomes "active," he is said to "assume the
body." This mode enables the rigger to visualize a three-dimensional map of the security system under his control, experience the system's sensor input and status as physical sensations,
and control the system through neurological impulses.
The rigger experiences local radio traffic picked up by the system's sensors as auditory
sensations. All CCSS systems use scanning receivers to monitor various friendly frequencies
and intercept potentially hostile radio transmissions. (CCSSs are commonly equipped with
decryption systems that have ratings equal to the system's Security Level.)
Normally, the system's security devices-drones, weapon ports, security doors, gas
vents, cameras and such-operate on "autopilot" when they are not under the rigger's active
control. If a device detects an anomaly or an automatic alarm goes off, the security system's
main computer contacts the security rigger, using sensory stimuli to gain his attention.
If a security system also has mobile drones under its control, the rigger may command
them as if he was in the "captain's chair" mode and controlling drones via a standard remote
control network. The maximum number of drones a rigger can command is equal to the rating of the rigger's remote control deck.,
Individual sensor triggers, such as a CCSS-rigged door being opened and closed or
unidentified peisonnel moving through the corridor, register as tactile sensations on the rigger's skin. The trigger's degree of importance determines the intensity of the sensation.
Regular triggers, such as the opening of a door to a sensitive area, register as mere twitches
on the skin, while a red alert with full klaxons may come across like a burn from a hot iron. To
determine whether a rigger recognizes important sensations, the gamemaster makes a secret
SECURITY RIGGER
Perception Test for the rigger whenever a significant trigger occurs. If the test succeeds, the rigger notices the trigger. Target
numbers for the Perception Test appear in the Rigger Perception Tests Table. If the alarm or sensors have been triggered, the security rigger automatically knows someone is there; no Perception Test is required.

When security riggers "jump" into particular components or
component groups of a CCSS, their audio/visual perceptions shift
into real-time perceptions of the vicinity immediately surrounding
the component, to a maximum of any single room less than 100
square meters and any corridor less than 25 meters long.
However, they retain awareness of the overall security system
through their tactile senses. Security riggers can jump into a drone
or into the groups of active security measures and countermeasures in a particular site location, such as a room or a corridor. In
the latter case, the rigger would take command of doors, climate
control, gun ports and the like within that area.
Note that riggers can perceive events only in the area covered by their CCSS. For example, a corporation might use several
closed-circuit systems to cover different parts of a facility. If a
rigged system covers only part of a facility, the rigger knows
which sections the rigged system does not cover and will not
know what is going on there.
ACTIONS IN A CCSS
Riggers may perform the following actions in a closed-circuit simsense system.
FREE ACTIONS
Activate/Deactivate Sensors: The rigger may activate or
deactivate sensors for one drone. Activated sensors will be online
at the start of the next Combat Turn.
Arm/Disarm a Weapon System: The rigger may arm or disarm one weapon system mounted on a drone or fixed weapon
port.
Delay Action: Per standard combat rules.
Call up an Overall Status Report: The rigger may monitor
the overall status of the security system.
Observe: The rigger may observe through any single drone,
* single room's sensors, or the sensors in a section of corridor. This
is the same as the standard Free Action Observe (p. 81, SRII).
Speak a Word: A rigger may broadcast a message via in
com to a room, a group of rooms, a section of corridor or
entire facility. This action follows standard combat rules (p.
SRII).
Suppress Automatic Alarms: The rigger may suppress
automatic alarm within the limits described in the previous colu
SIMPLE ACTIONS
Observe in Detail: The rigger may observe in detail (p.
SRII) through any single drone, room or section of corridor.
Jump into a Primary Drone: The rigger takes direct control
* single drone. (See Operative Modes, p. 65.)
Monitor Radio Traffic: The rigger may monitor radio co
munications on a single radio frequency.
COMPLEX ACTIONS
Control a Room: The rigger may take direct control of
weapon systems, security doors or other mechanical security
tems in a single room or a section of corridor. Rigger bonuses
all dice pools apply in this mode. (See Rigger Bonuses
CCSS.)
Fire a Weapon System: The rigger may fire an arm
weapon mounted on a drone or a weapon port. Riggers can
their Combat Pool only with drones or rooms they are control
directly. (See Rigger Bonuses in a CCSS.)
Issue a Command: The rigger may issue a command to
drone or a group of drones. The maximum number of drone
rigger can command is equal to the rating of the rigger's rem
control deck. (See Issuing Commands, p. 66.)
Operate a Drone: While jumped into a drone, the rigger
operate it as if she was driving it and use her Control Pool and
ger bonuses. (See Drones, p. 65.)
Turn On/Turn Off a Device: While directly controlling
room or corridor section, the rigger may turn on or off of
unspecified devices such as gas vents, sprinkler systems
lights. The rigger can also adjust the setting of variable-sett
devices such as thermostats and fans.
RIGGER BONUSES IN A CCSS
Security riggers automatically gain the Initiative bonuses co
ferred by the vehicle control rig, as well as other cyberw
described in The Rigger (pp. 16-18). Additionally, riggers m
use their Task Pools to defeat encryption and adjust to system protocols. However, when battling a security rigger, an intruding
rigger can use no dice pools except for his Karma Pool. Like NPC riggers fighting to retain control of a CCSS system can
draw on Threat/Professional Rating dice to augment their succe tests.
When riggers "assume the body," they do not have access any of their dice pools except the Karma Pool. Riggers gain access to their dice pools when they jump into a drone, room corridor, however.
THE SECURITY VALUE
Rigged security systems have varying levels of technologies capability (or difficulty, depending on how you look at it), as we
THE SECURITY RIGGER
45 varying levels of vigilance. (Anything from ultra-paranoia to
"Shadowrunners? What are shadowrunners?") These two characteristics are measured by a system's Technical Rating and Vigilance Code. The rating and code collectively form the system's Security Value.
The Technical Rating is a numerical value, from 1 to 10, which
Indicates the technological sophistication of the system. A
Technical Rating 1 represents an antiquated, near-obsolete system
that hasn't changed much since CCSS first came out. A Technical
Rating 10 represents a modern, cutting-edge system fielded with
state-of-the-art components.
The Vigilance Code indicates the overall watchfulness and
effectiveness of the security system. A facility can have the latest
and greatest security equipment, but it really doesn't mean much
If the company doesn't back it up with a thought-out security
plan, proficiently, trained security riggers, adequate technician
staffing and a proactive maintenance schedule. These and other
Intangible factors determine the system's Vigilance Code.
The Vigilance Code is expressed as a color-Blue, Green,
Amber or Red. Each color corresponds to the number of success6 a rigger must achieve during each step when accessing the
security system. Note that the Vigilance Code does not apply durIng rigger combat or after a rigger has taken control of a rigged
security system.
ACCESSING A SECURITY SYSTEM
Unless a rigger can battle her way through legions of guards
to access the security room where the security rigger operates
Ipossible, but not very likely), she will have to wrest control of the
security system from her opponent by accessing the network.
Unlike remote control networks, which relay information via
udlo transmissions, CCSS security networks communicate via
hardwired fiber-optic communication lines and underground or
embedded power cables. Therefore, CCSS networks are not vulnerable to MIJI attacks. To wrest control of a CCSS network away
from a security rigger, an intruding rigger must tap into the hardwired network and defeat the controlling rigger in rigger combat.
This process is divided into five steps, each a Complex Action:
1. Find a hardwire access point
2. Tap into a dataline
3. Defeat encryption
4. Adjust to system protocols
5. Defeat controlling rigger in rigger combat
To perform these steps, the intruder needs the following gear:
* remote control deck
* rigger protocol emulation module
* dataline tap (if necessary)
* rigger decryption module
STEP 1: FIND A HARDWIRE ACCESS POINT
The rigger must find some point in the system to which he
can hardwire a dataline tap (p. 243, SRII) or an RC deck. Most
rigged systems are not accessible from outside, so the rigger
VIGILANCE CODE CRITERIA TABLE

Description
Low vigilance. A corporate rigger from the motor pool doubles as a security rigger on an on-call basis only. Drones and defensive systems use nonlethal weapons and ammunition.
Moderate vigilance. The company employs a dedicated security rigger,
but he works on an on-call basis. Use of deadly force by drones and automated defense systems is authorized only during a state of alert called by
* (meta)human guard.
High vigilance. Full-time security riggers are jacked into the network 24
hours per day. The system is authorized to use deadly force, even if there
is no active alert. All network communications are encrypted.
Maximum vigilance. Security system and personnel are on constant,
active alert. All network communications are encrypted.
THE SECURITY RIGGER
will likely have to enter a protected area of the site to find such
* point.
Any fixed device connected to the CCSS network (such as a
camera, security door or gun port) can provide a valid hardwire
access point. However, a dataline tap is required to access such
points. Very rarely, CCSS systems have open slave ports scattered
throughout the site to enable roving security riggers to connect
RC decks to the network. Of course, intruders can also connect RC
decks to such points without the need for dataline taps. However,
open slave ports are heavily disguised and not usually placed in
easily accessible areas.
STEP 2: TAP INTO A DATALINE
To tap into a dataline, an intruder rolls a number of dice equal
to the dataline tap's rating plus his Electronics Skill. Task Pool dice
may be used for this test. The test is made against a target number equal to the system's Technical Rating. The intruder manages
to tap into the line if his test successes equal or exceed the successes listed for the system's Vigilance Code in the Vigilance Code
Criteria Table, p. 79.
STEP 3: DEFEAT ENCRYPTION
Many high-security systems encrypt their remote signals
and/or hardwires. If an outside rigger runs into encryption, he can
use a decryption module (see New Toys, p. 98) and make a
Decryption Test to decrypt the system's communications. The test
uses a number of dice equal to the decryption module's rating
plus the rigger's Intelligence. Any remaining Task Pool dice may
be used for this test. The test target number is the system's
Technical Rating. The intruder manages to decrypt the system's
communications if his test successes equal or exceed the successes listed for the system's Vigilance Code in the Vigilance Code
Criteria Table. If he fails, the security system goes on alert.
STEP 4: ADJUST TO SYSTEM PROTOCOLS
Not all rigged systems use the same protocols. Therefore, a
rigger intent on crashing a rigged security system must find out
beforehand what protocols the targeted security system uses.
Once the team rigger has this knowledge, she can use the protocol emulation module installed on her RC deck.
To do so, the rigger must make a test using a number of dice
equal to the protocol emulation module's rating plus her
Intelligence. Any remaining Task Pool dice may be used for this test.
The target number is the system's Technical Rating. The intruder
adjusts to the protocols if her test successes equal or exceed the
successes listed for the system's Vigilance Code in the Vigilance
Code Criteria Table. If she fails, the security system goes on alert.
STEP 5: RIGGER COMBAT
Once the outside rigger has completed the preceding steps,
he must fight the security rigger for control of the system. Because
rigged systems operate through hardware rather than software,
no hardening, defensive programs or intrusion countermeasures
exist. The two riggers use hardware to attack each other and inflict
real damage on one another. Rigger combat is conducted according to the following sequence:
Initiative
Each rigger rolls his rigged Initiative per the standard rules
The rigger with the highest result acts first. This roll can occur
part of the normal Combat Turn sequence. As in standard comba
* rigger acts during every tenth phase of the Combat Turn.
Attack/Disengage
The rigger who won the Initiative may choose to attack disengage. Attacking requires a Complex Action.
If the rigger attacks, the opponent makes an opposed Willpower Test. The rigger who initiated the action may use Control Pool dice. However, the number of dice used may exceed the attacker's Willpower.
The rigger who generates greater net successes on the tes
does (Willpower)L Stun damage to his or her opponent. Increase
the Damage Level by 1 for every 2 successes generated. The losing rigger makes a Body Test to resist the damage, augmented b
his or her Control Pool if the rigger desires. However, the number
of dice used may not exceed the rigger's Body Rating.
If either rigger decides to disengage, he or she jacks out
the system and surrenders control to the other rigger
Disengaging is a Free Action; re-entering the system requires
Complex Action.
Ending Combat
Combat proceeds until one of the two riggers disengages
passes out. If the intruder manages to overcome the security rigger, the intruder can manipulate the rigged system and/or drone
at will.
Additionally, the intruder gains access to all of the informe
tion that had been available to the defeated rigger. (See Actie
Security Riggers, p. 77; Actions in a CCSS, p. 78; and Riga
Bonuses in a CCSS, p. 78.)
DECKING A RIGGED SYSTEM
It is possible to deck into a rigged CCSS system, but a deci
er will never be able to control the system as efficiently as a nig
ger does (riggers interface directly into rigged systems, while
deckers must modify the user interface and operating system w
programs).
To deck a rigged system, a decker needs a cyberdeck ourf
ted with a rigger protocol emulation module (New Toys, p. 9%
and the software to run it. The decker performs steps 1-3
accessing a rigged system per standard rules (see Accessing
Security System, p. 79).
Combat between a decker and a rigger in a rigged system fo
lows the rigger combat rules, but the following restrictions app
to the decker:
* No Matrix programs may be used.
* The decker receives a +2 modifier on all tests.
* The decker's Initiative is at -2, and he gains no dice from the
deck's Response Increase.
* The decker has a Control Pool equal to one-half (rounde
up) of his emulation utility's rating.
* The decker takes damage as if from non-lethal black IC. (Se
p. 49, Virtual Realities 2.0.)
ADVANCED VEHICLE RULES
The following advanced rules are for Shadowrun players who want to add more realism
and additional levels of complexity (and math!) to running their rigger character. This section
offers more options for game play that cover both the everyday and extraordinary situations
characters may encounter when running the shadows. Because many of these options require
substantial number-crunching and character upkeep, players and gamemasters should review
these rules and choose only those that will enhance their game enough to balance out the
extra work required.
This section includes rules for fuel grade and consumption, rules for maintenance and
overhead during missions, quality factors (how well or poorly a vehicle is built), vehicle subsystem damage, additional gunnery rules covering a vehicle's electronic footprint, more
detailed remote control rules, and additional options for electronic warfare.
VARIABLE FUEL CONSUMPTION
* vehicle's Economy Rating measures how much fuel a vehicle consumes when traveling
at its standard Speed Rating. The Economy Rating is expressed as kilometers traveled per units
of fuel consumed.
If a vehicle is traveling at faster than its Speed Rating or is engaged in vehicle combat, it
consumes fuel more rapidly than during normal operations. In this case, fuel consumption is
expressed as a modified Economy Rating, as shown on the Economy Rating Table, p. 82.
RUNNING OUT OF GAS
If a vehicle runs out of fuel, it loses speed each turn at a rate equal to its Acceleration
Rating multiplied by 2. When the vehicle's speed reaches 0, it grinds to a halt. To determine

Zak is running a contraband shipment in his t-bird,
the Gray Ghost, from the Pueblo Corporate Council into
the CAS sector of the Denver Front Range Free Zone.
Unfortunately, on the last leg of his run, he cuts the altitude a little too closely and rips the underside of his fuel
tank, leaking fuel across the Rocky Mountains. As Zak
begins his final approach into the CAS sector at 1,000
meters per turn, the Gray Ghost's engine sputters and
dies, having consumed its last drop of fuel.
The Gray Ghost has an Acceleration Rate of 100, so
it loses speed each turn at a rate of 200 meters per turn.
That means the t-bird will remain airborne for only 5
more turns. The t-bird will travel 7,500 meters before it
comes to rest, as calculated with the coasting-distance
formula:
(.75 x 1,0002) + 100 = 7,500
Unfortunately, that will put the t-bird down over
some very rough badlands. A little farther past the badlands, however, lies a stretch of flat grassland, so Zak
tries to coax some more distance out of the Gray Ghost.
Zak has a Vector Thrust Skill 6, and he allocates 3
Control Pool dice to the Vehicle Test. The Gray Ghost has
* Handling Rating of 4. To simplify calculation, we'll
assume all other modifiers cancel each other out, so the
target number for the Success Test is 4. Zak's test generates 5 successes. The t-bird's Acceleration (100) multiplied by 5 equals 500, so Zak manages to make the Gray
Ghost coast for 8,000 meters before it stops, rather than
7,500.
AIRCRAFT MANEUVERS
The base Economy Rating for fixed-wing aircraft assumes that
the aircraft is making a normal takeoff or landing. When performing shortened or vertical landings or takeoffs (STOL, VSTOL, or
VTOL operations), aircraft consume more fuel than normal. During
* STOL takeoff, for example, an aircraft burns 20 percent of its initial fuel supply. A plane that takes off carrying cargo that exceeds
its Load Rating also consumes extra fuel. To determine how much
of an aircraft's initial fuel supply remains after an aircraft performs
one of these maneuvers, multiply the craft's initial fuel capacity
the appropriate multiplier on the Flight Maneuvers Table.
These fuel-consumption rules do not apply to helicop
zeppelins or LAVs.

Wu Pi, a "free entrepreneur" in the Hong Kong
Corporate Enclave, is delivering a shipment of chips from
the remote district of Tsuen Wan to prospective clients in
Vladivostok, Russia. Wu's Embraer-Dassault Mistral can
perform very short takeoffs and landings (VSTOL), and
that's a good thing, because Wu needs to take off from
* small plateau nestled between some very steep mountains. He's got about 150 meters of runway-just
enough for a VSTOL takeoff.
The Mistral has a standard fuel capacity of 2,000
liters, so the VSTOL takeoff will leave it with 1,600 liters
of fuel (2,000 x .8). The Mistral has an Economy Rating
of 2 km per liter, so Wu Pi will be able to travel 3,200
kilometers after taking off.

Let's get back to the Gray Ghost. As a t-bird, the
Ghost has about as much aerodynamic lift as a flying
brick and has a Stall Speed of 600 meters/turn. Its initial
speed was 1,000 meters per turn, and the t-bird is losing speed at a rate of 200 meters per turn, so Zak must
make a Crash Test two turns after running out of fuel.

"optempto," rules to calculate a
rigger's maintenance, fuel and
other overhead costs.
In military logistics, optempo is used to estimate the
accrued costs for maintenance,
fuel and overhead for a vehicle
based on its mileage during a
given period. The more mileage
* vehicle accumulates (from
deployments to hot spots, training exercises, and routine dayto-day use), the more fuel it
burns, and the more wear-andtear it accumulates. Conversely, a
vehicle that spends most of its
time sitting in the motor pool
consumes virtually no fuel and
requires far less maintenance
than an active vehicle.
CALCULATING OPTEMPO
To use optempo rules to
determine a vehicle's monthly
Maintenance Cost, first determine the listed base price of the
vehicle and all its modifications
using the Vehicle List and the
information in Vehicle Customization, p. 118 (not what the character actually paid). Divide that
number by 20,000, rounding the
value off to the nearest tenth.
The result is the per-kilometer
optempo rate of the vehicle.
To calculate the optempo
cost for a particular adventure,
multiply the total number of kilometers traveled by a vehicle during the adventure by the optempo rate. The final result is the
optempo cost for that vehicle for
that adventure.
Gamemasters can also creother fuel grades if they wish. To determine the effects of other
grades on the vehicle's Maintenance Cost and Economy
Ling, first determine the Acceleration increase or decrease the
provides. As a rule of thumb, custom fuel grades should not
grease or decrease Acceleration by more than 5.
OPTEMPO RULES
The Maintenance and Overhead rules (p. 18) assume that the
ger is operating his vehicle under the circumstances of a "typishadowrun (breaking into a reinforced corporate compound

COMBINING OPTEMPO AND REGULAR MAINTENANCE
Gamemasters may choose to combine the standard maintenance and overhead rules with the optempo rules using one of
the following options.
Splitting the Cost
To "split the cost," reduce both a vehicle's monthly overhead
rate and optempo mileage rate by half. The character pays half the
normal monthly maintenance rate on the vehicle, whether or not
he uses it during the month, and pays the optempo cost based on
the kilometers driven in that month.
ICED VEHICLE RULE
Frequently Used Vehicles
In this option, apply the optempo cost to vehicles that a character uses on a regular basis (for example, on every adventure).
Use the standard overhead rate for vehicles that the character
rarely uses (no more than once a month).
Significant Mileage
In the significant mileage option, optempo applies only to
vehicles and drones that exceed a preset mileage threshold during an adventure. The gamemaster sets the mileage threshold,
but may use the following suggestions as a rule of thumb: 200
kilometers per adventure for regular vehicles and 50 kilometers
per adventure for drones.
Vehicles that do not exceed the threshold can be maintained
by paying the standard Maintenance Cost.
QUALITY FACTORS
What Edges and Flaws are to Shadowrun characters, Quality
Factors are to vehicles. They represent intangible factors in a vehicle's manufacturing process, such as attention to detail, process
controls and professional workmanship, that affect a vehicle's purchase cost, performance, durability and Maintenance Cost.
Quality Factors that improve performance also increase the purchase price of a vehicle. Other factors reduce the purchase price
but diminish a vehicle's performance.
Players select Quality Factors during the vehicle design
process (see Vehicle Design and Customization, p. 108). The
Quality Factor modifier is applied to the vehicle's Mark-Up
Multiplier when the player calculates the final vehicle cost (see
Determine Final Vehicle Cost, p. 114). Apply any appropriate
special design multipliers (such as for drones or security-grade
vehicles) after adding or subtracting any Quality Factor modifiers.
* vehicle cannot take a Quality Factor with a negative modifier if
that modifier would reduce the Mark-Up Multiplier below . 1.
In the interest of game balance, no vehicle should be
designed using more than two Quality Factors.
The following entries describe available Quality Factors and
their Mark-Up modifiers.
Master Workmanship
Modifier: +.10 per level (maximum 3 levels)
* vehicle with the Master Workmanship Factor is produced
with loving attention to detail and craftsmanship. Because every
part of the vehicle is expertly crafted and assembled, the vehicle
runs better and suffers less damage from normal wear and tear,
and so has much lower maintenance costs than a comparable
vehicle of its type and price range.
For every level of Master Workmanship, reduce the vehicle's
Maintenance Cost by 10 percent (multiply the cost by .9). See
Maintenance and Overhead, p. 18, for more information on
vehicle maintenance costs.
Lemon
Modifier: -. 15 per level (maximum 3 levels)
* Lemon is a poorly built and shoddily designed vehicle that
costs more to maintain than it's worth.
For every level of Lemon, increase the Maintenance Cost of
the vehicle by 20 percent (multiply the cost by 1.2). See
Maintenance and Overhead, p. 18, for more information
vehicle maintenance costs.
Ruggedness
Modifier: +.50 per level (maximum 2 levels)
Ruggedness indicates that the vehicle is solidly built and
withstand an excessive amount of punishment from heavy
and abuse.
For every level of Ruggedness, a vehicle gains a -1 ta
modifier on Stress Tests (see Stress, p. 25).
Fragility
Modifier: -. 50 per level (maximum 2 levels)
* vehicle with Fragility is sensitive to overuse and br
down easily.
For every level of Fragility, a vehicle receives a +1 tar
modifier on Stress Tests (see Stress, p. 25).
Streamlined Layout
Modifier: +.25
* vehicle with Streamlined Layout has a well-desig
engine and chassis layout, which makes working on the ve
easier.
Characters working on a vehicle with Streamlined la
receive a -1 target modifier to all Build/Repair Tests.
Complex Chassis
Modifier: -. 30
* vehicle with a Complex Chassis has a poorly desig
engine layout that makes work on the vehicle difficult.
Characters working on a vehicle with a Complex Ch
receive a +2 target modifier to all Build/Repair Tests.
Custom Built
Modifier: -. 20
Custom Built vehicles have very special designs and fr
works. Consequently, modifications added later as vehicle
tomizations are more difficult to install. Double the parts cost
base time for all vehicle modifications installed during vehicle
tomization on Custom Built vehicles.
Prototype Model/Used Vehicle
Modifier: -. 60
* Prototype Model vehicle is an experimental design bu
evaluation and debugging. As such, it has a number of hidden
prises that won't be discovered until the vehicle is put throug
paces. Similarly, a used vehicle may have hidden flaws that
show up upon initial inspection or trial runs.
* Prototype Model/Used Vehicle starts out with 1D6 h
Stress Points. These Stress Points are not revealed until S
comes into play (either by the character pushing the limits
vehicle or botching a Success Test under the Stress Rule of
Gamemasters may reveal all of these hidden Stress Points all
first opportunity or dole them out over the course of an adver
or campaign. Once revealed, these Stress Points are added
vehicle's Stress Point total and may be reduced normally.
OVANCED VEHICLE ROLO
2.
fety Certified
Modifier: +.15
* Safety Certified vehicle incorporates additional features and
leguards in a vehicle's design to protect passengers in the event
ifa crash or collision.
Any passenger or driver riding in a Safety Certified vehicle
eceives a -1 target modifier when making tests to resist Collision
pamage. This modifier does not apply to vehicles resisting vehide damage or passengers resisting damage from weapon attacks.
Passenger Trap
Modifier: -. 15
* vehicle with the Passenger Trap Quality Factor has substanhurd passenger safety measures because the manufacturer has cut
corners to reduce the manufacturing cost of the vehicle.
Any passenger or driver in a Passenger Trap receives a +1 taret modifier on Resistance Tests made for Collision Damage.
This modifier does not apply to vehicles resisting vehicle
fumage or passengers resisting damage from weapon attacks.
VEHICLE SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE
Any time a vehicle sustains Moderate or greater damage
from a single source, one or more major subsystems may be damaged. To determine if subsystem damage occurs, the controlling
player rolls 1D6. Subtract 4 from the roll result if the vehicle sustained Moderate damage, 3 if the vehicle sustained Serious damage, and 2 for Deadly damage. Divide the modified result by 2,
rounding up. The final result is the number of potential vehicle
subsystems that may have taken damage.
To determine which subsystem is damaged, roll 1D6 and
consult Table 1, or simply choose a category from Table 1. Next,
consult the corresponding table and roll the appropriate number
of dice (or simply choose) to determine the particular subsystem
that is damaged. If the damaged vehicle is not equipped with the
modification or feature that results from the dice roll, consider it a
"no subsystem hit" for that particular result, or the gamemaster
may roll again. Finally, roll 1D6 and consult Table 8 to determine
the extent of subsystem damage. Refer to the Subsystem
Damage Notes for explanations of specific damage results.
Systems not listed in the notes appear elsewhere in this book.
Design options cannot take damage.

SUBSYSTEM DAMAGE NOTES
Rigger Control Box: The attack disrupts the rigger control
hardware installed in the vehicle and triggers an ASIST backlash.
The rigger must make a Damage Resistance Test against physical
damage. The damage Power Level is equal to the Power of the
vehicle's attack (after Armor reductions), and the Damage Code is
the result rolled on Table 8.
Handling: The attack damages the primary vehicle control
mechanisms. Increase the Handling of the vehicle by 1 for Light
damage, 2 for Moderate damage and 3 for Serious damage. If the
Handling sustains Deadly damage, the vehicle automatically
crashes.
Turret: The attack damages the servo-mechanism contr
the vehicle turret (if the vehicle has more than one turre
gamemaster may select which is damaged). Weapons fired
that turret suffer a Damage Modifier based on the results of
8. If the turret suffers Deadly damage, it is rendered inop
and frozen in place.
Target Acquisition System: The attack damages key
or electronic components relating to target-acquisition fun
Missiles, sensor-enhanced weapons and other smart weapo
fer a Damage Modifier based on the results of Table 8. If the
get-acquisition system suffers Deadly damage, the vehicle
lock onto a target and is unable to fire smart weapons. "D
ADVANCED VEHICLE RULES
weapons, such as rockets, cannons and firearms, are not affected.
The base cost for repairing the target-acquisition system is
one-half of the Parts Cost of the sensor system.
Engine Hit: The attack damages the engine, which in turn
reduces the vehicle's Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings. For
Light damage, multiply all Ratings by .9 and round down to calculate the new ratings. For Moderate damage, multiply
Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings by .7 and round down to
calculate the new ratings. For Serious damage, multiply
Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings by .4 and round down to
calculate the new ratings. If the engine suffers Deadly damage,
the vehicle loses power and decelerates at a rate equal to twice
is Acceleration, and the driver must make a Crash Test.
The base cost for repairing the engine is equal to 40 percent
of the vehicle's original cost plus any nuyen spent for engine customization (multiply the cost by .6).
Fuel Tank: The attack causes a leak in the vehicle's fuel system. For Light damage, calculate the loss rate by multiplying the
bel remaining by .01. The result is the amount of fuel that leaks
Auch turn. For Moderate damage, calculate the loss rate by multipying the fuel remaining by .05. For Serious damage, calculate
the loss rate by multiplying the fuel remaining by .1. If the fuel
ank sustains Deadly damage, it ruptures and the driver must
make a Crash Test. (Pyromaniac gamemasters may also check to
see if the destruction of the fuel tank results in an electrical fire or
bel explosion.)
The base cost for repairing the fuel tank is the vehicle's orighal cost multiplied by .9.
Passenger Compartment: The attack on the vehicle generdes shrapnel in the passenger compartment. Passengers must
make Damage Resistance Tests against physical damage. The
damage Power Level is equal to half the Power of the attack
against the vehicle (after armor reductions), and the Damage
Code is the result rolled on Table 8.
Aggravated Body Damage: The attack seriously weakens the
infrastructure of the vehicle. For Light damage, reduce the vehide's Body by 1 (except Body 1 vehicles, which suffer no loss). For
Moderate damage, reduce the vehicle's Body to one-half its
value, rounded up. For Serious damage, reduce the vehicle's
lody to one-third its original value, rounded up. Deadly damage
* the vehicle's Body destroys the vehicle, and it automatically
crashes.
The base cost for repairing the vehicle's Body is equal to the
chicle's original cost multiplied by .6.
Armor-Defeating Hit: The attack reduces the effectiveness of
te vehicle's armor. Light damage reduces the Armor Rating by 1.
Moderate damage reduces Armor by 3, Serious damage reduces
Armor by 6, and Deadly damage reduces the Armor Rating by 10.
Armor points lost in this manner are gone for good and can be
recovered only by replacing the armor.
Note that this rule is separate from the Armor Degradation
rules (p. 75, Fields of Fire). At the gamemaster's discretion, both
sets of rules may apply.
REPAIRING SUBSYSTEMS
When repairing modifications and accessories, use the stancard vehicle-repair procedure with the following exceptions.
To determine the cost of repair parts, first multiply the number of damage boxes by .05. Then multiply the result by the Parts
Cost of the modification or accessory.
The target number for the Repair Test is based on the level of
damage (L, M, S, or D) per standard rules. The base time for repair
is equal to the base time for installing the modification or accessory.
See the Vehicle Design and Customization (p. 118) for more
information about modification and accessory Parts Costs and
base times.
ADVANCED GUNNERY RULES
The following optional rules are designed to enhance the "realism" of shooting weapons at or from vehicles.
FOOTPRINT
The discharge of intense, raw electrical power from a vehicle's transmitters shines like a beacon on the electromagnetic
spectrum. Consequently, vehicles with strong transmitters can be
easily targeted by sensor-enhanced weapons.
The Footprint Rating reflects this increased "visibility." The
Footprint Rating is subtracted from the target number on tests
made against a vehicle or device's Signature. To determine a
vehicle's Footprint, add the Flux Ratings of all its transmitters
(radios, remote-control decks, sensors, ECM), divide the result by
10 and round to the nearest whole number.
Josie Cruise is conducting reconnaissance from her
van, Rough Rider. She is simultaneously operating a
drone via a remote control deck (Flux 8) and a shortwave radio (Flux 6) to keep in touch with her teammates.
That gives her a Footprint Rating of 1, calculated as follows:
[(8 + 6) + 10] = 1.4, rounded to
nearest whole number = 1
The van's standard Signature is 4, so tests made
against its Signature would use a Target Number 3.
Reducing Footprint
* rigger can attempt to reduce her vehicle's Footprint Rating
by making an Electronic Warfare Test against a target number
equal to the Footprint Rating + 4. A number of Task Pool dice may
be used in this test up to the character's skill/concentration rating
level. For each success, reduce the vehicle's total Flux by 1, then
re-calculate the Footprint Rating.
Each attempt to reduce Footprint requires a Complex Action.
Riggers may make multiple attempts, and the effects of each
attempt are cumulative. However, increase the Electronic Warfare
Test target number by 2 on each additional attempt beyond the
first.
Any time an Electronic Warfare Test generates a result of all
1s, double the vehicle's total Flux and re-calculate the Footprint
accordingly.
Josie Cruise wants to reduce Rough Rider's Footprint
Rating of 1, so she uses a Complex Action and makes an
Electronic Warfare Test. She has Electronics 3, so she
uses 3 dice for the test. The target number is 5 (Footprint
* plus 4).
The test generates 3 successes, which reduces
Rough Rider's total Flux from 10 to 7. Seven divided by
ten and rounded to the nearest whole number yields a 1.
however, so the Footprint Rating remains the same.
Josie then uses another Complex Action and makes
another Electronic Warfare Test. Again her test generates
* successes, so now the total Flux drops from 7 to 4.
Four divided by 10 equals 0.4, which drops to 0 when
rounded to the nearest whole number. Thus, Josie has
completely eliminated Rough Rider's Footprint.
BREAKING MISSILE-TARGET LOCK
To lock onto a target and fire a missile at it, an attacking vehicle must first detect the target vehicle with a sensor-based
Perception Test (see Missile Combat, p. 59). Therefore, a target
that manages to break contact with an attacker's sensors can
cause missile attacks against it to miss.
To break a target lock, the character controlling the target vehicle must make a Hide Action before the missile strikes at the
end of the Combat Turn in which it is fired. (Remember that don
so requires a Complex Action.) If the Driving Test for the action generates a number of successes greater than or equal to the missile's Intelligence, the character breaks the target lock, and missile misses.
If the Hide Action Test generates a number of successes lo
than the missile's Intelligence Rating, the character doesn't shale
off the missile. The character may make another attempt (assum
ing he has another Complex Action left before the end of
Combat Turn), but increase by 2 the number of successes requiem
to break the target lock for each additional attempt.
ADVANCED VEHICLE ROLOIENDED-RANGE MISSILES
Some anti-air missiles and advanced surface missiles have
ges of 5 to 10 kilometers and greater. As a result, several turns
* pass before such a missile reaches its target. The Extendedge Missile rule provides an alternate means for tracking miscombat for such missiles.
This rule applies to any missile with an extended range
ter than 2 kilometers. Under this rule, the gamemaster treats
Ich missiles as vehicles operating with one goal: to close in on
* designated target (Accelerate) and then collide with it (Ram).
Accelerating/Braking, p. 45, and Ramming, p. 47, in
cle Combat for details.)
Use the missile's Intelligence for the Driving Tests required
these actions. All missiles have a Handling of 4, and their
ative is equal to the missile's Intelligence plus 2D6. Anti-surmissiles have a fixed speed of 1,000 meters per turn, and
Fair missiles have a fixed speed of 5,000 meters per turn.
DVANCED REMOTE CONTROL RULES
The basic remote control rules in the Drones section provide
imple, comprehensive system for running drones. Players who
ut more complex drone rules can spice up their rigging reperles with the following rules.
-PROGRAMMED DRONE COMMANDS
Phrasing comprehensible commands for drones can consume
able Combat Actions, and drones may misunderstand or mispret commands. Entering pre-programmed commands into a
lem's remote control deck can solve both of these problems.
If a rigger pre-programs the various commands required for a
dicular maneuver, he can then utter a single, short command
his RC deck will send out the pre-programmed commands and
omatically direct the drones to perform the action. For example,
ligger might give the command "Home," and the rigger's car,
nected via the remote-control network, would automatically
* to the rigger's position by following pre-programmed cominds from the deck. Alternately, a rigger could say "Pearl Harbor
th." and five aerial attack drones would fly in a V-formation due
th, attacking any people or vehicles they see.
To use pre-programmed commands, a remote-control deck
ist be equipped with Storage Memory as an accessory. Pre-proinmed maneuvers can be as simple or as difficult as the rigger
sires, but the following restrictions apply:
1. A pre-programmed command can only cover a single,
ecific task. For example, if a rigger wants to have a group of
ones fly in a formation in a certain direction, then change
use, she must pre-program two separate commands, one for
ch leg of the journey. Further, commands must state the specifdetails of the drone's task, leaving nothing vague or opended. For example, if a rigger pre-programs drones to fly in foration, she must specify the type of formation (including the disce between drones) the direction of travel, the distance to be
veled and the speed.
2. The complexity of the command, as determined by the
memaster using the Skill Success Table in SRII (p. 68), cannot
greater than the remote control deck rating.
To enter a pre-programmed command into a remote-control
deck, a rigger must make a Non-Matrix Programming Test during
her preparation time before the run. The gamemaster sets the test
target number, based on the command's complexity and the target numbers listed in the Skill Success Table (p. 68, SRII). The
gamemaster should tell the player the target number before the
player makes the test and give the player the option of reducing
the command's complexity to lower the target number. Keep
track of the number of successes achieved.
Every pre-programmed command takes up memory in the
deck's storage. Calculate a command's size with the following formula:
([Command's Complexity Target Number]2 x 100) + Number of
non-Matrix Programming Test successes
* Memory Requirement in Mp
Calculate the time required to program the command with
the following formula:
Target Number + Number of non-Matrix Programming Test successes = hours needed to program
During a run, a rigger can activate a pre-programmed command simply by using a Free Action. The remote control deck
then automatically directs the drones to act in accordance with
the pre-programmed commands.
BACK-UP CHANNELS
Because the data-processing capability of a remote control
deck is divided over three separate radio channels-the command channel, system channel and simsense channel-a rigger
can reserve one of those channels as a "back-up" in case one of
the other two channels goes down due to electronic warfare. If a
channel has suffered degradation from MIJI, the rigger can choose
to close down that channel and transfer the functions of the channel onto another one.
If a channel is serving as a back-up for a second channel, all
actions performed on both channels suffer a +2 modifier. And
because the volume of transmissions on the channels is higher, an
intruder receives a -1 modifier when attempting to locate that
channel (see Signal Interception, p. 68).
* rigger cannot move all three channels onto one frequency.
Otto Matick is using a remote control network to
perform some scouting and fire support, when a jammer
locates his command channel and starts jamming it. Otto
decides to transfer the functions of the command channel to the system channel.
As long as Otto uses the system channel as a backup channel for the command channel, he receives a +2
target modifier when using issuing commands to drones
(normally transmitted via the command channel) and
directing indirect fire (normally transmitted via the system channel). Furthermore, if the jammer tries to locate
Otto's system channel, he receives a -1 modifier to his
target number.
THE SERVER SYSTEM FOR CRDS
Normally, a cranial remote deck (CRD) has very low transmitting power, which forces a rigger to haul around power amplifiers,
either on a bulky backpack or as part of a cyberlimb (taking up preQUANCED VEHICLE RUL
cious space that could be used for cyberguns, spurs and so on).
Alternatively, a rigger may choose to configure his CRD as a
super-subscriber to a conventional remote control deck.
In this option, the CRD reduces the number of drones the normal deck can control by one (since the CRD counts as one of the
subscribers) and gives control of the remote control network to
the CRD. The normal deck then becomes a "server" that provides
auxiliary support to the CRD. The effective rating for the network
is the rating of the CRD or the rating of the standard deck,
whichever is lower. Options and accessories (such as ECCM, protocol emulation modules, BattleTac systems and the like) that are
incorporated in either deck are both available. (Players should
place the majority of remote control accessories on their server
deck and as few as necessary on their CRDs, to save on Essence
and monetary costs.)
The Range of a remote control server system is based on the
Flux of the server deck. However, remember that the center of
effect is the server, not the CRD. If the rigger wanders outside of
the server's range, the CRD loses contact with the remote control
network, and the rigger is dumped out of the system.
ADVANCED ELECTRONIC
WARFARE RULES
These advanced rules for electronic warfare are to be used for
MIJI attempts against remote control networks (see MIJI, p. 69).
RANGE AND PARTIAL MIJI ATTACKS
Normally, a remote control network is susceptible to MIJI
only when its remote control deck is within the range of the
intruder's electronic device. However, even if the target remote
control deck is outside the intruding device's range, the intruder
can still make a MIJI attack against any of the network's drones
that are inside the intruding device's range.
In such cases, resolve electronic warfare per standard rules.
However, only those drones inside the intruding device's range
are affected. If a drone leaves the intruding device's range, it is
free from the effects of MIJI.
If a rigger has jumped into a drone within the range of the
intruding device, the rigger is vulnerable to the effects of dump
shock if the intruder dumps the rigger through a successful jamming or interference attempt.
MIJI ON MULTIPLE CHANNELS
If an intruder has successfully intercepted two or all three channels of a remote control system, he can try to make a simultaneous
MIJI blitz on all intercepted channels. When making a multiplechannel MIJI attack, the intruder makes a normal MIJI Test, but
applies a +3 target modifier for each additional channel the intruder is trying to blitz. In other words, an intruder receives a +3 target
modifier to the MIJI Test if attempting to use MIJI on two channels
simultaneously, and a +6 modifier to the MIJI Test if attempting to
use MIJI on all three channels of a remote control network.
An intruder can make only one type of MIJI attack when
ing a multiple MIJI attempt.
BARRAGE JAMMING
Barrage jamming is a jamming technique that jams all
frequency bands. When using barrage jamming, a jamme
not need to make an Interception Test and jams all ch
(including normal radio) at the same time. On the other
because the jammer is spreading his electromagnetic
across a wide range of frequencies, he has a sharply re
range and, more important, his own device/vehicle be
more vulnerable to detection by enemy sensor systems and
weapons.
When employing barrage jamming, the jammer autom
ly jams all radio and radio-telephone communications and
signal degradation on all of his opponent's Signal Monito
every 3 points of Flux used in barrage jamming, 1 box of
degradation on all of the opponent's Signal Monitors are fil
To determine the effective range of barrage jamming,
all standard ranges by 20. In other words, the range for a b
jammer is equal to 500 meters, plus the barrage jammer
multiplied by 200.
Additionally, barrage jamming reduces the Signature
jammer. For every 2 points of Flux used in barrage jam
reduce the jammer's Signature by 1. A jammer's Signature
fall below 2, but any excess Signature reductions offset any
ifiers that increase the Signature or Signature-based target
bers.
The tactic of barrage jamming does not work with me
ing, intrusion or interference.
HOT MIKE JAMMING
"Hot mike" is military slang, referring to situations in w
radio transmitter overrides all other signals on a frequency
venting other individuals from talking on that frequency and
tively jamming it. This usually results from a faulty microphe
loose connection, but a similar effect occurs when a spe
rude enough to interrupt another person's transmission.
someone interrupts another person's transmission by ove
the signal, soldiers say that the interrupter "stepped on" the mission.)
In Shadowrun, "hot mike" jamming is an improvised m
of jamming that uses standard transmission equipment, so
radios or remote control decks, in lieu of ECM. "Hot mike
ming works on both standard radio communications (see
Equipment, p. 184 in SRII) and remote control deck tran
sions. However, when using "hot mike" jamming against
control decks, the jammer receives a +2 target modifier
MIJI Tests, because the set-up of a remote control networ
vides partial protection against accidental transmissions.

This section describes new weapons, drones and other accessories guaranteed to make
the most jaded rigger character drool. Specific uses for many of these toys have been
described in earlier chapters of this book. Rules for designing and modifying vehicles using this
equipment appear in the Vehicle Design and Customization chapter, beginning on page 108.
The toys in this section are organized into groups by type, covering Weapons, Cyberware,
Remote Control Accessories, and Drones and Robots. Each item includes a short description
of the toy's creation and use in the Shadowrun world, followed by specific game information
and rules for use in the game. The game statistics for each piece of equipment appear in a
table at the bottom of each page.
Some equipment in this chapter represents new versions of equipment published in previous Shadowrun sourcebooks. At the gamemaster's discretion, the current versions of these
pieces of equipment may remain available to his player characters, though he may choose to
reduce the cost and Availability target number for his campaign. The new, revised versions of
this equipment should be considered the state of the art for that equipment, and the
gamemaster should set the cost and Availability at a level suitable for equipment and innovations new to the market.
ARES VENGEANCE & VANQUISHER MINIGUNS
The Vengeance and Vanquisher series of miniguns are the
heavier cousins of the popular Vindicator minigun (p. 58, Street
Samurai Catalog or p. 279, SRII) and use the Vindicator's rotating-barrel design. The CAS army recently chose to equip its
Avenger VII motorized air-defense vehicle with Vanquishers.
Game Effects
Like the Vindicator, both the Vengeance and Vanquisher
require 3 seconds (1 Combat Turn) of start-up time to get the barrels rotating at firing speed. Due to their high rate of fire, both the
Vengeance and Vanquisher have a minimum rate of fire of 6
rounds per Combat Phase. They also have a maximum autofire
rate of 15 rounds per phase, instead of the standard 10 rounds per
Combat Phase. The Vengeance and Vanquisher follow the doubleunmodified recoil rules for heavy weapons (p. 89, SRII), but
mounting the miniguns on a vehicle hardpoint (see Fixed
Mounts, p. 131) cancels out the special recoil modifier.
Vengeance and Vanquisher miniguns can make use of gyroscopic stabilization, but they cannot accept gas-vent recoil compensation. Likewise, they can accept top-mounted weapon accessories but they cannot carry barrel or under-barrel weapon accessories. Vengeance and Vanquisher miniguns can be mounted on
vehicle weapon mounts (see Vehicle Weapon Mounts, p. 131),
but they cannot be mounted on ordinary bipods or tripods.
Because of their heavy mass and punishing recoil, Vengeance
and Vanquisher miniguns are not man-portable.
ARES VIGILANT & VICTORY AUTOCANNONS
The Vigilant and Victory autocannons are vehicle-mounted,
autofire versions of the standard, single-shot assault cannons.
These extremely popular heavy-suppression weapons commonly
are mounted on all but the lightest armored personnel cam
(APCs) and infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs).
Game Effects
Both the Vigilant and Victory are capable of firing in sing
shot (SS) and fully automatic (FA) modes. When firing in full-au
matic mode, both cannons fire a minimum burst of 6 rounds
have a maximum rate of fire of 12 rounds per phase.
The Vigilant and Victory autocannons can be mounted o
on fixed hardpoints or turrets. Because they are heavy weapo
they both negate the half-recoil modifier for hardpoints (see FI
Mounts, p. 131). Vigilant and Victory autocannons can acc
vehicle weapons accessories but no other weapon accessories
The Vigilant and Victory are not man-portable weapons.

Vogeljäger uses a launcher equipped with a Level 2 sensor unit. The
man-portable sensor functions just like normal vehicle sensors,
except that it has a +4 modifier for detecting objects on the ground.
When firing a Vogeljäger against a ground target, the attacker receives a +4 modifier to his Gunnery Test and the missile only
nflicts 8D damage.
This missile has a range of 50 meters to 10 kilometers.
SAAB-SAAKER AIM-11R AIR-TO-AIR MISSILE
The "R" model is the latest in Saab-Saaker's AIM-11 series of
ar-to-air missiles. Like its predecessors, the AIM-11R is a shortrange air interceptor weapon designed to be used with air-supefority fighters such as the Federated Boeing Eagle or the dozens
of Eurofighter variants in existence around the world.
Game Effects
The Saab-Saaker AIM-11R may only be mounted on aircraft.
When firing it against ground targets, the attacker receives a +4
modifier to his Gunnery Test and the missile only inflicts 8D damage. This missile has a range of 150 meters to 15 kilometers.
Sales of AIM-11Rs are tightly controlled. The gamemaster
can set any Availability Rating he desires, though we recommend
* target number of at least 20.
MITSUBISHI-GM OUTLAW VEHICLE MISSILE SYSTEM
The Outlaw vehicle missile system from Mitsubishi-GM is the
successor to the original Bandit AGM system. Mitsubishi-GM will
discontinue production of the Bandit beginning in the fourth quarler of 2058.
The Outlaw represents a radical restructuring of the Bandit
system. Due to popular demand, the Outlaw features multi-platform capability and can be fired from air, ground and nautical
vehicles. In addition, the electronics of the missile incorporate the
tew dual-fire mode technology. This feature enables the user to
set the weapon on continuous target lock for improved strike
accuracy, or on fire-and-forget shooting mode for quick engagements during evasive maneuvers.
But the most significant design change is the ordnance itself,
which comes in three block versions. Block I Outlaw uses
Improved conventional munitions (ICM), which disperse microbombs when the missile is flying directly overhead its designated
target or impact point. The compound detonations of the bombs
do significant damage to all targets within the missile's area of
effect, making ICM more effective against area targets than standard explosives.
Block IA Outlaw improves on the ICM concept with dual-purpose improved conventional munitions (DP-ICM). Instead of
spherical micro-bombs, DP-ICM uses shaped charge explosives,
oriented downwards by a training cloth streamer. The shapedcharged munitions give the bombs more penetrating power, making them effective against soft-skinned vehicles and light armor.
Block II Outlaw is an anti-armor missile designed to attack
medium and heavy armor. On acquiring its target, Block II
Outlaw flies directly overhead and fires its warhead into the
vehicle from above, where armor is generally weakest. Block II
Outlaw is also capable of direct fire when the target is concealed
by overhead cover.
Game Effects
All versions of this missile have a range of 50 meters to 10
kilometers.
Block I Outlaw (ICM) functions as a special high-explosive
missile. Instead of inflicting blast damage that diminishes in Power
farther from the center of the explosion, ICM inflicts the same
damage code on all targets within a fixed radius from the target
point. The target and all characters, vehicles and other objects
within a 10-meter radius must resist 14D explosive damage. This
damage affects only objects within a 10-meter radius around the
target. Vehicles automatically stage the damage down by one
step to Serious, per the vehicle damage reduction rules (see
Vehicle Damage from Weapons, p. 53).
Block IA Outlaw (DP-ICM) has the same effects as Block I,
except that the shaped-charged munitions negate vehicle damage reduction. Vehicles must resist against 14D vehicle damage,
but the vehicle gets the full benefit of its Armor Rating (this is an
exception to the anti-vehicle munitions rule (see Vehicle Damage
from Weapons).
Block II Outlaw behaves as a standard anti-vehicle missile
and does 20D damage to the target alone. It is an armor-piercing,
anti-vehicle weapon, so vehicle armor is only half as effective, and
the vehicle does not reduce the Damage Code by 1 level (see
Vehicle Damage from Weapons).
The top-attack capability of Block Il is a special effect and
does not affect game play.
TEXTRON "TRAPDOOR" SMART MINES
The Trapdoor is the latest generation of wide-area munitions
(WAMs) designed to counter an enemy force's mobility. Using
seismic, acoustic, magnetic anomaly and various other types of
sensors, the Trapdoor passively scans for hostile vehicles. Once
the mine detects a target, it validates the target based on criteria
pre-programmed into its internal control electronics. If the target
is confirmed as friendly, the Trapdoor stands down.
If the Trapdoor identifies the target as hostile, however, the
mine launches a single submunition over the target. The submuConceal

nition acquires the target and fires an explosively formed
penetrator (EFP) through the top of the target, destroying it.
Not only does this make the Trapdoor an effective anti-tank
mine, but its "top-attack" capability makes the Trapdoor
equally effective in downing helicopters and LAVs flying at
an altitude of less than 100 meters.
In addition to static placement, the Trapdoor may be
deployed via rocket-artillery self-contained anti-armor mine
systems (RASCAM). The RASCAM is compatible with both
standard vehicle rocket launchers and the Outlaw VMS system (p. 93).
Game Effects
The Trapdoor smart mine is a stationary weapon system
that consists of three parts: a Rating 4 sensor, a Rating 2
Pilot, and three submunitions.
The Trapdoor uses its sensor to search for targets within its 500-meter scanning range. When it finds a target, the
Pilot determines whether or not that target is friendly, based
on pre-programmed criteria. The criteria can be anything its
user wishes, within the limits of what the mine can comprehend.
During programming, the mine makes a Comprehension Test
against the user's criteria (see Issuing Commands, p. 66). The
gamemaster should tell the player the target number for the test
and give him the option to downgrade the criteria. Programming
* Trapdoor mine requires one Complex Action.
If the target is hostile, the mine launches one submunition
into the air. Make a Sensor-Enhanced Gunnery Test (see SensorEnhanced Gunnery, p. 58), using the mine's Pilot Rating in place
of the Gunnery Skill. The submunition has a Damage Code of 14D
and is an anti-vehicle, armor-piercing submunition (which means
that the vehicle does not reduce the Damage Level by 1 and can
use only half of its Armor Rating, rounded down, to reduce the
submunition's Power).
Trapdoors may be deployed manually or via a RASCAM rocket. A RASCAM rocket holds eight mines. When placing mines,
make an Indirect Fire Test (p. 60). The location determined by the
test (after accounting for scatter direction and distance) is the center of effect. The mines deploy in an octagonal pattern for 50
meters around the center of effect.
LORAL-VOUGHT "ZAPPER"
STATIC DISCHARGE ROCKETS
The "Zapper" static-discharge rocket is a specialized weapon
used against drones. Rather than a high-explosive warhead, the
zapper carries an electrically charged dielectric, encased in alternating layers of conductive metal and ceramic insulation. On impact,
the warhead acts as a giant capacitor and discharges a massive
electrical surge into the drone, causing its circuitry to burn out.
One controversial side-effect of
the zapper is that, as it burns out the simsense circuitry in
drone, it creates a backlash of garbled ASIST signals and spike
affect the controlling rigger. These ASIST backlashes often ca
convulsions and fatal strokes or aneurysms in riggers. The Uni
Nations is currently debating whether to include zappers amo
the list of banned "cruelty" weapons, alongside land mines, blin
ing lasers and chemical-biological weapons.
Game Effects
Zapper warheads behave as normal anti-vehicle rockets, w
one exception. In addition to damaging the vehicle, the electr
discharge also creates a disruptive simsense signal that affects
gers and other characters controlling the vehicle cybernetical
either by being jacked into the vehicle or directly controlling
through a remote control deck.
If the rocket does damage to the drone, the rigger m

LORAL-VOUGHT "JABBERWOCKY"
AMMER MUNITIONS
The Jabberwocky adds a new twist to the phrase
electronic warfare." Instead of an explosive warlead, the Jabberwocky disperses electronic
lansponders that jam sensors, voice radio and digitransmission systems. Jamming transponders
my be set to activate on dispersal, after a pre-set
the delay or upon detection of transmission signals
within the area of effect.
Game Effects
Jammer rockets and missiles behave as standard rockets or missiles until impact. On impact, the
missile scatters jamming transponders that may jam
sensors (as ECM), radio communications, or remotecontrol transmissions (the type is pre-determined
when purchasing the munition and cannot be
Hanged after the fact). Anti-sensor jammers act as
level 4 ECM (see Electronic Countermeasures, p.
31). while anti-remote jammers act as Level 4 jammers (see Jamming, p. 71).
The transponders affect a circular area with a
radius equal to 50 meters plus 3D6 times half the
umber of successes generated on the Gunnery Test,
punded up (50 + [3D6 x (Gunnery Test successes +
18. The transponders have a Flux of 6 for resolving electronic warbure results, but they do not affect transmissions outside the area
of effect. Jamming from Jabberwocky transponders affects all
ansmissions of the transponder's type, whether friend or foe.
Abberwocky munitions may be fired only from vehicle weapon
mounts. See p. 107 for firing ranges.
LORAL-VOUGHT "SILENCER" ADVANCED
ANTI-RADIATION MUNITIONS (AARM)
Loral-Vought's Silencer series of munitions are an advanced
version of the high-speed anti-radiation missiles (HARMs) of the
previous century. Officially designated as advanced anti-radiation
unitions (AARMs), Silencers lock onto the emissions of sensor
stems as well as anti-sensor ECM.
Came Effects
AARMs behave according to the missile combat rules on
age 59, with one exception. Rather than using the opposing
O
MJ
vehicle's Signature as a target number, the AARM target number
is equal to 12 divided by the highest active Flux Rating from the
target vehicle's Sensors or ECM (rounded down). The target number cannot drop below 1. AARMs are vehicle missiles and can be
fired from vehicle weapon mounts only. The Silencer has a range
of 50 meters to 12 kilometers.
CYBERWARE
CRANIAL REMOTE DECKS
Cranial remote decks (CRDs) represent a long-awaited revolution in rigger technology. Incorporating some of the computer
and microtronic advances used in cranial cyberdecks for the past
six years, the rigger carries the miniaturized cranial remote deck
in his head, freeing the rigger from a fixed station and giving him
mobility within his network's area of coverage. CRDs also use ESCMitre's modular hardware architecture, providing CRDs with the
operational flexibility of desktop systems.

Game Effects
Using a cranial remote deck (CRD) is the same as using a normal remote control deck, except that cranial remote decks have a
Flux Rating of 0, due to their small size. If a rigger wishes to
increase a CRD's transmission power, he must connect the CRD to
an external signal amplifier. CRD power boosters and signal amplifiers can be mounted on backpacks, and a few of them can even
be incorporated into cyberlimbs.
The table on page 96 provides statistics for the cranial remote
deck, as well as all deck accessories also available in CRD form
(see Remote Control Accessories, p. 97). Riggers with CRDs may
use headware memory (p. 247, SRII) for the same purposes as
remote control storage memory.

BATTLETACT IVIS
The success
of
the
BattleTac™ system has resulted
in two new variants now available for remote control systems:
BattleTac IVIS and BattleTac
FDDM. IVIS stands for InterVehicle Information System and
enhances the data-sharing capabilities between the remote
control deck and drones. By
improving information-sharing,
these systems enable drones to
execute more complex and
sophisticated tactics to accomplish their assigned tasks.
Game Effects
In game terms, BattleTac
IVIS does one of two things: it
provides extra dice for a drone's
Comprehension Test, or it creates a dice pool, known as the
IVIS Pool, that can be used for
tests made by drones. To use the IVIS system, the remote control
deck or CRD must carry the master unit as an accessory. In addition, only drones whose pilots have been modified to interact
with BattleTac IVIS receive the benefits of this system. For more

drones that cannot "see" the target to fire on it.
Game Effects
The BattleTac FDDM system allows one drone to fire its
weapons at a target detected by another. The remote control deck

REMOTE CONTROL ENCRYPTION MODULE (RCEM)
Though remote control decks hop from frequency to frequency to maintain signal security, signals are still occasionally
intercepted. To guard against this, the remote control encryption
module provides an added layer of communications security by
encoding and decoding the digital signals in a secure routine.
However, because of the special digital nature of MSST protocol,
normal crypto circuit routines (p. 77, Street Samurai Catalog) are
incompatible with remote control decks.
Remote control encryption module encryption routines comply
with both government (the NSA) and corporate (ITCC) regulations.
Game Effects
The remote control encryption module (RCEM) encodes and
decodes remote control signal transmissions, making them indecipherable to intruders who intercept a remote control channel.
Only rigger decryption modules (see below) can break the
encryption of RCEMs. Data codebreakers (p. 243, SRII) and
Scramble Breaker HDs (p. 81, Street Samurai Catalog) are ineffective against RCEM encryptions, because the RCEM uses entirely different encryption routines.
Remote control encryption modules are available in ratings of
* through 10. For more information on using RCEMs, see Signal
Interception, page 68.
RIGGER DECRYPTION MODULE
The rigger decryption module is a diagnostic tool used by
security riggers. This module's firmware contains sophisticated
cryptographic routines that enable a user to test the encryption of
his rigged security systems and drones. The external version of
this module is mounted in-line between the rigger's system-control-rig dataport and the system undergoing diagnostics. Remote
systems require the internal model, which must be installed

REMOTE CONTROL ECCM
ECCM, or electronic counter-countermeasures, use no

control transmissions. ECCM defends the integrity of a re
control network from outside noise, whether due to exo
solar activity or wanton jamming by a hostile intruder.

lectronic warfare. Signal amplifiers are
deful accessories that boost the electrougnetic power available for transmison, increasing a remote control deck's
ective range and making it less vulnerle.
* Effects
Signal amplifiers increase a remote
ontrol deck's Flux Rating, which
creases the effective range of a remote

deck is equipped with an intercom.
* rigger can also connect multiple
screens to a remote control deck so that
each screen displays a single drone's
point of view. The maximum number of
screens that may be connected to a
remote control deck is equal to the
deck's rating.
REMOTE CONTROL
ORAGE MEMORY
Storage memory is just as important for remote control decks
it is for cyberdecks. Without storage memory, how could a rigrecord the images being received from the drones under her
ontrol? It is a foolish rigger who deploys her drones without stormemory to record the results.
TCHER JACKS
The success of cyberdeck hitcher jacks prompted the
velopment of hitcher jacks for remote control decks. These
cessories enable a second individual to plug into a rigger's
etwork, providing a second set of eyes to watch the operation
id increase awareness of the remote control operation.
ame Effects
Hitcher jacks for remote control decks work the same way as
bey do for cyberdecks. They allow other characters to perceive
verything the rigger sees and does. If the rigger is in captain'shair mode, so is the observer; if the rigger is directly controlling
drone, the observer perceives only the signals from that drone.
Itcher jacks also allow an observer to communicate with the riger, but they do not provide the observer with any control over
operation.
INTERCOM SPEAKER
An often overlooked accessory to any remote control network is a two-way intercom. This minor yet important device facilitates communication between the rigger and onlookers.
Additionally, the speaker has a port that enables any voice radio
to be connected to the intercom.
Game Effects
The intercom speaker allows two-way communication
between the rigger and people within close proximity to the
remote control deck. Without an intercom speaker, a rigger has to
focus attention on her meat body to speak with her own vocal
cords. (Doing so requires a Complex Action and imposes a +8
modifier to all actions taken while the rigger is speaking.)
AUTOSOFTS
Autosofts are expert systems that augment the decisionmaking capabilities of drones in limited areas of knowledge.
Autosofts add their rating to the Pilot Rating of the drone when
the drone performs an action that falls under the autosoft's area of
expertise. Currently, two autosoft programs are available: TAPS
Sharpshooter and IPA ClearSight.

TAPS Sharpshooter Autosoft
TAPS stands for target-acquisition processing system.
The TAPS Sharpshooter is a target acquisition and gunnery
expert program that enables drones to fire more accurately.
This accessory allows a rigger to mass more effective firepower without the need for direct involvement in every step
of the attack.
Game Effects
TAPS Sharpshooter adds its rating to the drone's Pilot
Rating for all Gunnery Tests made with the drone. This
autosoft may not be used while a rigger is directly controlling
the drone. The TAPS Sharpshooter is available in Ratings 1-5.
IPA ClearSight Autosoft
ClearSight IPA makes use of the latest imagery-analysis
expert systems available from the intelligence community.
This accessory allows a rigger to identify a fuzzy image in
mid-run-rather than later suffering the consequences of
ignorance.
Game Effects
IPA ClearSight adds its rating to the drone's Pilot Rating
for Perception Tests made with the drone. Additionally, a rigger can use it in conjunction with her own Intelligence for
general Perception Tests. In this case, the ClearSight Rating
may not exceed the rigger's Intelligence Rating.
IPA ClearSight may not be used for any combat-related
Success Tests. The IPA Clearsight is available in Ratings 1-5.
DRONES AND ROBOTS
AEROQUIP "REDBALL EXPRESS"
LONG-RANGE RESUPPLY DRONE
The "Redball Express" is a large drone designed for transporting supplies and equipment. Under contract to the CAS army,
Aeroquip designed the Redball Express as a means of delivering
ammunition, electronics and other supplies in small quantities to
CAS special forces troopers deep behind enemy lines.
The Redball Express is an unmanned aerial vehicle with twin
tilt-wing jet engines. The tilt-wings allow it to perform standard
take-offs from a friendly launch site (thus conserving fuel) and perform near-vertical landings in tactical areas, where landing space
is at a premium.
AERODESIGN SYSTEMS CONDOR
LDSD-23 & CONDOR II LDSD-41

ARES ARMS SENTRY II
An improved version of the original Sentry system, the Sentry
Il incorporates the latest in drone technology advances. Features
include an MSST transceiver, which allows the Sentry II to interface
with any remote control network. Additionally, the system's
remote control adaptor enables the Sentry Il to take advantage of
BattleTac IVIS, which can multiply the firepower of the system
when more than one Sentry II system is used.
Game Effects
The Sentry II is a portable automated weapons stand that
behaves like a drone. Because it is immobile, the Sentry II "drone"
has a Speed of 0 and uses standard combat rules rather than vehicle combat rules.
AZTECHNOLOGY HEDGEHOG SIGNAL INTERCEPTOR
The Hedgehog signal interceptor drone is a signal-intercept
and precision-emitter location system that intercepts and identifies opposing command, control, communications and intelligence (C31) transmitters. Leap-ahead technology exploits communications intelligence and signal intelligence to provide the user
with vital electronic information about his opponent. In addition,
the low profile offered by the small drone allows deep penetration into otherwise secure areas.
Game Effects
The ability to intercept enemy voice and data transmissions
via electronic intelligence, or ELINT, during a pre-run recon and
real-time during ops can give the rigger and his team a significant
advantage over the opposition.
Exploiting signal intelligence can tell you if your enemy is
using encryption, what kind of protocols they use for data transmissions, signal strength and so on. If signal intelligence is handled correctly, a rigger can determine the location of the other
side's central command center, the kind of sensor systems they
are using, where they do and do not scan frequently, whether
they use drones and CCSS and so on.

CITROËN BROUILLARD SMOKE GENERATOR
The Brouillard provides continuous, wide-area smoke cov
age. Unlike the so-called vehicle smoke generator system offer
by Ares Arms, the Brouillard uses an electric burner instead d
smoke-grenade dispenser, which enables the Brouillard to operate for up to an hour without refueling. Additionally, the gene
tor includes a special infrared screening module, which disser
nates graphite particles within the smoke, providing up to
minutes of infrared smoke screening.
Game Effects
When stationary, the Brouillard produces a cloud of smo
with a diameter of 150 meters and a height of 10 meters. W
moving, the smoke billows from the generator in a conic dispe
sal pattern, forming a 100 by 250 by 10 meter trailing do
Anything inside the cloud is obscured by heavy smoke (use

TOYOTA MK-GUYVER SEARCH AND RESCUE ROBOT
The MK-Guyver is the first drone to take advantage of new
robotic self-learning technology. Its ability to adjust its programming in response to unexpected circumstances makes it a topnotch performer for search and rescue in perilous environments.
The MK-Guyver moves by means of tracks, but it also possesses auxiliary legs for movement over rough and uneven terrain. It has two mechanical arms with modular fittings and an
acetylene blowtorch for cutting through rubble or barriers.
Game Effects
Because the MK-Guyver has two methods of movement, it
has two Speed and Acceleration ratings. The first number indicates its Speed and Acceleration when using tracks. The second
number indicates its ratings when using mechanical legs.
Remember that a drone obeys standard combat rules instead of
vehicle combat rules when propelled by mechanical legs (see
Mechanical Legs, p. 35).

VEHICLE DESIGN & CUSTOMIZATION
Like a magician's spells, a rigger's vehicles and drones give the rigger power in the third
millennium. And in the same way a custom spell can make a name for a magician, a unique
vehicle can set a rigger apart from all other joystick jockeys.
This section provides rules for designing and modifying vehicles in Shadowrun. The first
two subsections, Vehicle Design and Vehicle Design Options, cover the design of new vehicles. The third subsection, Vehicle Customization, covers the modification, upgrade and customization of existing production models.
The vehicle design and customization rules provided in this chapter supersede all previously published vehicle-construction rules. All vehicles that have appeared in previous
Shadowrun publications have been re-constructed according to the new vehicle design system and their ratings recalculated accordingly. These revised ratings appear in the Vehicle List
(p. 148). See Converting Existing Vehicles (p. 147) for guidelines on converting vehicle statistics from the old system to the current one.
VEHICLE DESIGN
Like a well-designed character, a well-designed vehicle demands some thought and creativity on the part of the player designing the machine. The point of vehicle design is not simply to cram the most armor, fastest engine and heaviest weapons into the cheapest vehicle
frame. The point is to create a vehicle with special features and capabilities that best serve and
enhance the character's own unique needs and personality.
The design process begins with the selection of a vehicle chassis and power plant, which
together form the base for the vehicle's Design Point Value. The Design Point Value is the total
sum of all the Design Points added to the vehicle. As additional improvements, enhancements, modifications and accessories are selected, more Design Points are added to the vehicle's Design Point Value. At the end of the process, the gamemaster multiplies the Design
Point Value by the Mark-Up Factor to determine the final price of the vehicle.

The design process can be divided into the following steps:
1. Select a Chassis
2. Select a Power Plant
3. Add Design Options
4. Add Vehicle Modifications
5. Determine Final Vehicle Cost
STEP 1: SELECT A CHASSIS
The chassis is a template that determines what type of vehide is being constructed (bike, car, airplane and so on), as well as
the vehicle's specific subtype (subcompact or sedan, ultralight or
airliner and so on).
Besides the vehicle type, the chassis selected determines the
starting values for certain Vehicle Ratings, namely Handling, Body,
Armor, Autonav or Pilot, Sensor and Cargo Factor (CF). The chas's also determines the starting seating arrangement, the arrangement of entry points, the set-up and breakdown time for drones,
the landing and takeoff profiles for aircraft, and any other accessories and options that are already available for the chassis. The
Chassis Table (p. 169) lists the different types of chassis available
and the starting Vehicle Ratings for each.
The Body Rating of a chassis is fixed; it cannot be improved
tor reduced. Other Vehicle Ratings may be improved by adding
design options and vehicle modifications that enhance those ratIngs. Doing so increases the Design Point Value of the vehicle and
subsequently increases the final price.
Ratings may also be decreased if the player or gamemaster
desires. For example, a player may wish to decrease the Armor or
OF Rating of his rigger's custom vehicle below the starting value
horder to create the fastest possible racing car. A player may also
remove standard chassis components such as doors or seats.
However, such "downgrades" do not decrease the Design Point
Value or final price of the vehicle.
Chassis fall into one of eight categories, based on the Vehicle
Skill needed to operate them: bikes, cars, fixed-wing aircraft, hovErcraft, motorboats/sailboats, rotor craft, vectored-thrust craft and
pecial vehicles.
Bikes
Bikes include two, three, and certain four-wheeled openlopped vehicles that a driver operates by sitting on top of the
vehicle. Bikes cannot have Autonav Ratings greater than 2 unless
they are modified for rigger adaptation. Bikes are divided into the
following subtypes.
Scooters: Scooters are short-range city commuter vehicles.
They do not offer spectacular performance, but they are fairly cheap.
Racing Bikes: Racing bikes are designed to achieve and suslain high speeds.
Off-Road Bikes: Off-road motorcycles are designed for traVersing rough terrain and have better-than-standard off-road
Handling Ratings (at the expense of on-road Handling).
Choppers: Choppers are heavy motorcycles designed for
long-distance cruising.
All-Terrain Vehicles: All-terrain vehicles (ATVs) are three- or
bur-wheeled versions of the off-road bike. ATVs are easier to handle
off-road, but they sacrifice on-road Handling Rating as well as speed.
Cars
Cars include all manner of ground vehicles, including wheeled
and tracked vehicles. Cars are divided into the following subtypes.
Commuters/Subcompacts: Subcompacts are small, inexpensive cars designed primarily for commuting within a city. Most
are one- or two-seaters and have very little cargo space.
Sedans: Sedans are medium-sized, four-seat cars. This subtype includes everything from family Ford Americars to luxury
Toyota Elites.
Sports Cars: These two-seat cars are designed for moving at
extremely high speeds.
Limousines: Limousines are extended-length luxury cars,
such as the Mitsubishi Nightsky, designed for carrying extra passengers, amenities and accessories.
Pickups: Pickups include light trucks that weigh less than
1.25 tons (1,250 kilograms), such as sport-utility vans, 4WDs,
jeeps and Hummers.
Vans: Vans are trucks that weigh between 1.25 and 2.5 tons.
RVs: All-terrain recreational vehicles (RVs) weigh in between
1.25 and 2.5 tons and are designed for long-range travel. RVs come
equipped with living and sleeping amenities as a standard option.
Sand Buggies: Sand buggies are light, open-air four-wheeled
vehicles designed for off-road use. Although similar to ATVs in
structure and design, sand buggies can carry more passengers (up
to four) and more cargo. Most sand buggies use open tube-frame
chassis, but they often carry attachable canvas or plastic overhead
and side panels for protection against the elements.
Medium Transports: Medium transports are freight-haulers
that weigh between 2.5 and 5 tons.
Heavy Transports: Heavy transports are heavy-duty freight
trucks that weigh in at 5 to 10 tons.
Tractors: Tractors usually weigh as much as heavy transports
but they have no internal cargo capacity. Tractors are designed to
pull one or more trailers and can haul as much as 18 tons of cargo.
Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs): APCs are 15- to 30-ton
armored ground vehicles designed for carrying troops into combat. (For an example of an APC, see the Devil Rat, p. 64 of Fields
of Fire.) Though often mistaken for tanks, APCs are vulnerable to
anti-vehicle missiles and can carry only the smallest of heavy
weapons. APCs may use either tracks or wheels for propulsion.
Crawlers: Crawlers are unmanned drones designed for
exclusive control by a remote control deck. Crawlers may move
via tracks or wheels; few differences exist between the two types.
All crawlers (and all drone chassis) come with a remote control
interface and rigger adaptation as standard options.
Crawler chassis come in three sizes: micro, small and large.
Micro-sized crawlers range in size anywhere from six to nine inches long and are light enough to be carried in the palm of a person's hand. Small crawlers may be as small as a toaster or as large
as a large dog. Large crawlers are roughly comparable in size to a
motorcycle or a human lying prone on the ground.
Remote Patrol Vehicles (RPVs): RPVs are armored ground
drones, designed to patrol and defend an area against unwanted
intruders. RPVs may be tracked or wheeled. Most are roughly the
size of a large dog, though some are as large as an average human.
Fixed-Wing Aircraft
Fixed-wing aircraft are airborne vehicles that use aerodynamic lift (as opposed to directed air pressure or vectored thrust) to
stay aloft. This category does not include helicopters, tilt-wing or
jump-jet aircraft. Piloting a fixed-wing aircraft requires the
Winged Planes Skill. Fixed-wing aircraft are divided into the following subtypes.
Ultralights: An ultralight is a very small, single-pilot aircraft.
Although the term originally referred to open-air hang gliders
powered by an internal-combustion engine, any single-passenger
aircraft, regardless of structure, is considered an ultralight for
design purposes.
Single-Engine Aircraft: A single-engine aircraft possesses
only one propulsion engine (either propeller or turbine).
Twin-Engine Aircraft: A twin-engine aircraft is a middleweight airplane with two propulsion engines, either propeller
or turbine. Examples include regional or commuter aircraft that fly
between small airports and larger ones serving major airline companies.
Airliner: An airliner is a heavy-duty aircraft, such as those
operated by major air carriers. Airliners are capable of transcontinental or even intercontinental flight and rely on two, three, four
or occasionally five heavy propeller or turbofan engines.
Airliners fall short of high-speed civil transports (HSCTs) in
terms of speed, range and capacity. However, standard riggers
lack the skills and resources to design, modify or buy HSCTs and
their larger cousins, suborbitals and semiballistics.
Jet Fighters: Jet fighters are supersonic combat aircraft controlled by one or two pilots. Jet fighters have a lifting capability of
several tons, most of which is used for carrying heavy bombs and
long-range missiles. Jet fighters never carry more than the lightest
armor, to preserve their maneuverability and ordnance-carrying
capacity.
Fixed-Wing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs): UAVs are
drone aircraft. Fixed-wing UAVs come in three sizes: small, medium and large. Small fixed-wing UAVs are approximately the size
of toy model aircraft. Medium-sized UAVs have fuselages comparable in size to a dwarf or a small human. Large UAVs have fuselages as big as trolls, and some of the larger ones can actually
carry metahumans.
Hovercraft
Also referred to as air-cushion vehicles or ACVs, hovercraft
float centimeters above the ground or water on a cushion of pressurized air . Maneuverable on both land and sea, they make excellent amphibious vehicles. However, ACVs are not seaworthy without modification and will sink if powered down over water. ACVs
are divided into the following subtypes.
Small Hovercraft: Small hovercraft are roughly comparable in
size to pickups or sport utility vans and are used primarily as
recreation or pleasure craft.
Medium Hovercraft: Medium hovercraft are approximately
as large as vans or lightweight medium transports. Medium hovercraft are used as amphibious recreation vehicles, light cargo and
passenger carriers, and even security vehicles.
Heavy Hovercraft: Heavy hovercraft are comparable in size to
medium or heavy transports and can haul large numbers of passengers or large freight loads. The Confederated States Marine
Corps uses armored heavy hovercraft as rapid-assault and screening vehicles during amphibious combat operations.
Skimmers: Skimmers are drone hovercraft. They come in two
sizes, small and large, which are comparable in size to small and
large crawlers.
Motorboats/Sailboats
Though motorboats and sailboats require different skills to
handle, both use similar hull designs and are thus grouped
together for design purposes. The Motorboat/Sailboat category
covers only those boats with an overall length of less than 1
feet (40 meters). Standard rigger characters lack the skills a
resources to design, modify or buy larger boats and ship
Motorboats and sailboats are divided into the following subtyp
Skiffs: A skiff is a small boat under 20 feet (6 meters) long
Water Scooters: Water scooters, sometimes called jet s
are waterborne versions of motorcycles. They are exclusiv
motor-powered for design purposes.
Speedboats: Speedboats are high-speed boats, such as
cigarette racing boat. Some not-so-powerful versions also ex
for daytripping. Speedboats generally measure between 24 a
40 feet long.
Sport Cruisers: Sport cruisers are medium-sized boats, go
erally used as pleasure boats by the wealthy. Sport cruisers ge
erally measure between 20 and 60 feet (4 and 20 meters) long
Yachts: Yachts are large boats with an overall length grea
than 60 feet (20 meters), but less than 120 feet (40 meters). M
of them are the toys of the well-to-do. All yachts come with ba
living amenities.
Mini-subs: Mini-subs are submersible boats capable of tra
eling underwater. They are 15 meters or less in length and
dive to a maximum depth of 450 feet (150 meters). Larger a
deeper-diving submarines are beyond the scope of this sourd
book and are not covered in these rules.
Rotor Craft
Rotor craft generate vertical lift by propelling air downwar
creating a localized updraft that lifts the aircraft. This catego
includes helicopters and tilt-wing aircraft. Rotor craft are divid
into the following subtypes.
Autogyros: Autogyros are single-passenger ultra-light he
copters, such as the Ares Wasp or Yellowjacket. Though they
significant Body and Armor Ratings and engine performance, th
are very versatile.
Utility Helicopters: Utility helicopters are medium-siz
multipurpose helicopters, such as the Hughes WK-2 Stallion.
Cargo Helicopters: Cargo helicopters are large helicopt
designed for carrying heavy loads. The Ares Dragon is one exa
ple of a cargo helicopter.
Tilt-Wing Airplanes: Tilt-wing airplanes are fixed-wing
craft that can alter the incidence of their wings and perform vertical take-offs and landings. These craft have traveling ranges comparable to fixed-wing aircraft, yet they can hover and make vertical landings like helicopters. Almost all tilt-wing airplanes are propeller-driven.
Attack Helicopters: Attack helicopters are one- or two-pa
senger high-performance combat helicopters. Most militaries u
attack helicopters as missile carriers for close-air support
longer-range deep-strike missions. Consequently, they tend to
lightly armored. Because they are so specialized, attack he
copters are rarely used for any other role.
Rotary Wing UAVs: Rotary wing UAVs are drone helicopter
They come in three sizes: small, medium and large. Small rota
UAVs measure between 8 to 14 inches long (many can even
held in the palm of one's hand). Medium and large versions a
equal in size to fixed-wing UAVs.
Tilt-Wing UAVs: Tilt-wing UAVs are drone tilt-wing aircra
They come in two sizes, medium and large, which correspond
size to medium and large fixed-wing UAVs.
Vectored-Thrust Craft
Vectored-thrust craft use directed jets of turbojet and turbofan exhaust to generate force and overcome the pull of gravity.
Vehicles that fall into this category include low-altitude vehicles
(known commonly as "thunderbirds") and jump-jet fighters (such
as the current AV-8 Harrier). Vectored-thrust craft are divided into
the following subtypes.
Thunderbirds: Also known as low-altitude vehicles (LAVs) or
"t-birds," thunderbirds have no wings and rely entirely on jet propulsion to provide lift and thrust. Without adequate power, tbirds become flying (or more precisely, falling) bricks.
Consequently, thunderbirds generally have short
ranges and tremendous fuel requirements.
In most militaries, thunderbirds are used for
short-range close air support, as well as
armor support in terrain not suited to tank
maneuvers. In these applications, t-birds
are heavily armored and fitted with
machine guns and assault cannons in
place of rockets and missiles.
Jump-Jet Fighters: Jump-jet fighters are
similar to standard fixed-wing jet fighters
but have additional vertical vents for vertical landings and takeoffs and hovering.
(To date, the Federated Boeing Eagle is
the only published Shadowrun vehicle
that fits this description.)
Vectored-Thrust UAVs:
Vectored-thrust UAVs are drone tbirds. They come in three sizes: small,
medium and large. These sizes correspond to the sizes of fixed-wing UAVs.
Special Vehicles
Special vehicles are vehicles that do not fit
into existing vehicle categories. Controlling special vehicles normally requires a Special Skill, but
in most cases a character can default to a relevant
Vehicle Skill with a +2 target modifier (+1 if the character is a rigger and the vehicle is rigged). Special
vehicles are divided into the following subtypes.
Zeppelins: More commonly known as
"blimps," zeppelins are rigid-structure, lighterthan-air (LTA) dirigibles that use helium to provide
lift. Zeppelins are huge but fairly easy to bring down. Jet propeller engines propel most zeppelins, though some have been
outfitted with turbojets.
Mini-Blimps: Mini-blimps are miniature zeppelins. Their
capability for hovering indefinitely makes them especially wellsuited for reconnaissance and wide-area surveillance.
Walkers: Walkers are drones that use robotic legs for propulsion. (Legs can provide a distinct advantage over wheels or tracks
when crossing difficult terrain.) Walkers come in three sizesmicro, small and large-which correspond to crawler sizes.
Anthroforms: Anthroforms are specialized walker drones
with metahuman-shaped bodies. They can perform nearly any
physical task a metahuman can, and can do it with greater
strength, speed and agility than even a cybered metahuman.
However, anthroforms lack the intelligence, breadth of experience
and creative adaptation that metahumanity possesses, which is
why anthroforms have not replaced metahuman workers except
in high-risk hazard areas, such as nuclear power plants and ultraheavy industrial work areas.
Inspired by some of the adventures of Allied forces
in Operation Desert Storm, Steffi wants to re-create the
tactical beach buggy used by some of the U.S. light
infantry and special forces in that campaign. Steffi
decides to call this armed dune buggy the LockheedChenowth Light Strike Vehicle, a product created in joint partnership
between
the
defense giant
Lockheed and the British corporation Chenowth.
Scanning through the Chassis
Table (p. 169), Steffi finds the perfect chassis: the Sand Buggy. The
Sand Buggy has the following
stats: Handling 4/4, Body 3,
Armor 0, Cargo 4 (with a maximum of 15), Autonav 0, and
Sensor 0. It starts with four bucket seats, two in the front and
two in the back, and is an
open-entry vehicle. This chassis is worth 20 Design Points,
so the Design Point Value for
Steffi's new vehicle starts out
at 20.
Rich, on the other hand,
is a racing fan and wants his
rigger, named the Bratly Kid, to
own a Formula One race car. The
Bratly Kid is determined to own
the most amazing car in the sprawl. (Hey, it takes
all kinds.) The BK also recently grabbed the
brass ring-he got an honest-to-Dunkelzahn
big payday! Nuyen is not an object, and so
Rich can modify his rigger's vehicle to his
heart's content.
Looking through the chassis list, the closest thing
Rich can find to a Formula One car is the Sports Car
chassis. The Sports Car comes with two bucket seats and
two doors. Because Formula One racing cars have only
one seat and no doors, Rich decides to remove the doors
and the extra seat. However, he still has to pay the full
number of Design Points for the chassis.
Rich looks up Sports Car in the Chassis Table and
finds that the vehicle has the following stats: Handling
4/8, Body 3, Armor 0, Cargo 3 (with a Maximum of 18),
Autonav 0 and Sensor 0. In addition to its two bucket
seats and two doors, it also allows top entry. Rich only
wants the top entry. The Design Point Value for a sports
car is 110, and so Rich begins vehicle construction at
that amount.
2. SELECT POWER PLANT
* vehicle's power plant provides power to move the vehicle
and operate its accessories and modifications. The type of power
plant selected determines the starting and maximum values of the
vehicle's Speed, Acceleration, Load and Economy Ratings, as well
as the vehicle's initial Signature Rating and fuel tank size.
The Power Plant Table (p. 167) lists the different power plants
available, the chassis that may use each type of power plant, and
the starting and maximum values conferred by each power plant.
If a chassis type is not listed under a particular power plant, the
vehicle may not use that power plant.
All templates begin with the vehicle's Speed and Load at the
base minimum rating. Either rating may be increased with the
addition of extra Design Points to the vehicle's Design Point Value
(see Add Design Options). Players and gamemasters may also
reduce ratings below their starting values if desired, but doing so
will not decrease the Design Point Value of the vehicle.
Electric Motor
Direct-current, battery-powered electrical motors have high
Signature Ratings because they generate little heat compared to
other types of engines. However, their low power outputs produce low Speed and Load Ratings. The fuel consumption of electric motors is expressed as a Power Factor (PF).
Methane Engine
* methane engine is a combustion engine that uses methane
gas instead of gasoline as its fuel. Methane burns cleaner than
gasoline, which makes it a highly touted alternative in the NAN
and other environmentally friendly countries. Methane engines
provide lower overall performance and lower Signature Ratings
than gasoline engines, but they also have far greater fuel capacities. The fuel consumption of methane engines is expressed in
bars of air pressure. (For you technoheads out there, one bar is
slightly less than the pressure of the atmosphere at sea level14.5 psi or 105 newtons per square meter.)
Gasoline Engine
Even with the development of alternate fuel sources, petroleum-derived gasoline remains the primary fuel for most ground
and water vehicles and some aircraft. Some countries (such as the
NAN) and several metroplexes, however, may impose legal limits on the use of such vehicles within their respective jurisdictions
for environmental reasons. The fuel consumption of gasoline
engines is expressed in liters.
Diesel Engine
Diesel is another petroleum-based fuel used by many vehicles. Diesel has a lower flashpoint than gasoline, which tends to
limit the Speed Ratings of diesel-powered vehicles, but diesel
engines provide higher heat-conversion efficiency-which results
in a higher Load capability-than gasoline engines. The fuel consumption of diesel engines is expressed in liters.
Jet Propeller Engine
Jet propeller aircraft use propellers to blow air over their
wings, creating aerodynamic lift with forward thrust on the side.
Propeller aircraft are slower than jets (props can't break the sound
barrier, for instance), but they generally have higher Signatures,
better fuel economy and lower price tags than jet turbine engines.
Propeller engines consume jet fuel, which is measured in liters.
Tilt-wing aircraft are the only aircraft other than the FixedWing Aircraft category that use jet propeller engines.
Jet Turbine Engine
Jet turbine engines include turbojets, turbofans, ramjets-just
about anything short of a space rocket engine. Though more powerful than jet propeller engines, jet turbine engines have lower
Signatures, consume more fuel and are expensive to build and
maintain.
All rotor craft and vectored-thrust aircraft-except for tiltwing designs-use jet turbine engines.
Sails
Sails harness the power of the wind and may be used with
certain types of watercraft. Sailing is a tricky skill to master, how
ever, so sailcraft generally underperform in comparison to their
powered counterparts. However, sail-powered vessels have the
highest Signature Ratings, as well as unlimited "fuel mileage"-as
long as the wind is blowing, of course.
Steffi, deciding to keep things simple, determines
that the Light Strike Vehicle will have a gasoline engine.
Looking through the Power Plant Table (p. 167), Steffi
finds the following entry for the Sand Buggy chassis
under the Gasoline heading: Speed 90 (maximum 100),
Acceleration 6, (maximum 10), Load 40 kg (maximum
160 kg), Signature 2, Economy 8 km/liter (maximum 12
km/liter) and Fuel 40 liters.
* gasoline engine for a sand buggy is worth 25
Design Points, which increases the Design Point Value
for the new vehicle to 45 points.
Rich's choice is easy. Sports cars only come with
gasoline engines. Under the Sports Car entry, Rich finds
Speed 160 (maximum 270), Acceleration 10 (maximum 18), Load 40 (Maximum 200), Signature 2,
Economy 6 km/liter (maximum 10 km/liter) and Fuel 60
liters. The Design Point Value for a sports-car gasoline
engine is 65, pushing Rich's Design Point cost to 175.
3. ADD DESIGN OPTIONS
Design options are improvements, enhancements and acces
sories added to the vehicle by the manufacturer during the eng
neering and manufacturing processes. Design options are m
available to shadow mechanics on the street.
As a general rule, any feature or improvement that invol
internal restructuring of the vehicle is considered a design optic
Additionally, the gamemaster may re-designate any vehicle med
ification (see Add Vehicle Modifications, below) as a des
option if he wants to limit or restrict his players' access to
modification.
Some design options consume cargo space or add weight
the vehicle. These factors are listed under CF Consumed and Le
Reduction for each entry in Design Options and also und
Design Specifications for each entry in Vehicle Customization
118). If a vehicle incorporates an option that takes up CF or Low
reduce the appropriate rating by the amount of CF or Load
sumed. No vehicle can carry more design options than its
Load Rating allows.
VEHICLE DESIGN Ano
Steffi decides that her new Light Strike Vehicle
should have a better off-road Handling Rating, so she
decides to make a straight Handling improvement to
the vehicle's off-road Handling Rating, reducing it from
* to 3.
* straight Handling Improvement (p. 116) costs 25
points for every point subtracted from the vehicle's onroad or off-road Handling Rating. Therefore, the
Handling reduction increases the Light Strike Vehicle's
Design Point Value by 25 points, from 45 to 70.
Steffi also decides to increase the vehicle's
Acceleration Rating from 6 to 8. Improving the
Acceleration costs 25 Design Points per point of
increase, so this 2-point increase adds 50 more Design
Points to the strike vehicle's Design Point Value, raising
it to 120 points.
Anticipating some of the modifications she's planning to incorporate into the vehicle, Steffi decides to
increase the vehicle's Cargo and Load Ratings. She
decides to add 2 CF to the Cargo Rating and 30 kg to the
Load Rating for final ratings of Cargo 6 and Load 70. The
associated Design Point costs for each option are 10
Design Points for the Cargo increase and 3 points for the
Load increase. This increases the Design Point Value of
the Light Strike Vehicle by 13 points, from 120 to 133.
Meanwhile, all Rich thinks about is speed, speed
and more speed. First, Rich is going to break the bank
and get himself a vehicle made with smart materials.
This costs him 100 Design Points, but allows him to
increase the vehicle's maximum Speed and Acceleration
ratings by 15 percent (it also allows for an increase in
Load, but Rich doesn't care about that).
The smart materials increase the racing car's maximum speed to 311 and bump up the maximum
Acceleration to 21. For the record, the maximum Load
Rating rises to 230. The Design Point Value has gone up
to 275 points. The gamemaster also notes that the MarkUp Factor multiplier has just increased by .5 and the car's
Availability is 4.
Rich decides it's time to increase the Acceleration
and the Speed. Both upgrades cost 2 Design Points per
point of increase. Rich is going to max them both out, so
he increases Acceleration by 11 points (from the standard Sports Car maximum of 10 to the new maximum of
21). This costs him a total of 22 Design Points (11 x 2).
The Speed Rating increase goes from the standard maximum Speed of 160 to the new maximum Speed of 311,
* total increase of 151 points. This upgrade costs Rich
302 Design Points (151 x 2). The total Design Points for
both rating increases is 324, which brings Rich's revised
Design Point Value up to 599.
Next. Rich decides to increase his Load Rating
because some of the toys Rich wants will require more
power from the engine. Each 10-kg increase in Load
costs 1 Design Point. Rich decides to add more than he
thinks he will need, because you never know what you
may want to customize later. So Rich adds 100 kg to his
car's Load Rating for a total of 140 kg (well below the
maximum of 230). That increase costs him 10 Design
Points, raising his vehicle's Design Point Value to 609.
Finally, Rich realizes that speed without good handling means he'll be driving a death trap. Rich wants to
improve his on-road Handling (if he has to take this thing
off-road, he's already lost the race). He improves the
Handling to its maximum by reducing the standard
Sports Car Handling Rating from 4 to 2. That improvement costs 25 points per point of reduction, for a total of
50 Design Points. Adding this to the Design Point Value,
Rich gets a new total of 659.
4. ADD VEHICLE MODIFICATIONS
Unlike design options, vehicle modifications (mods for short)
are enhancements and accessories that can be installed in a new
vehicle by the manufacturer or added to an existing vehicle by a
rigger or shadow mechanic as vehicle customizations (see Vehicle
Customization, p. 118). Generally, vehicle mods installed during
the design process have fewer restrictions than those added during vehicle customization, but they also cost more.
When installing a vehicle mod during vehicle design, remember to use its Design Point cost only when calculating the final cost
of the vehicle. Do not use the modification's nuyen cost.
Some modifications consume cargo space or add weight to
the vehicle. These factors are listed under CF Consumed and Load
Reduction for each entry in Design Options and also under
Design Specifications for each entry in Vehicle Customization. If
* vehicle incorporates an option that takes up CF or Load, reduce
the appropriate rating by the amount of CF or Load consumed.
No vehicle can carry more modifications than its CF or Load
Rating allows.
Now it's time to add all the neat toys and flashy features to the Light Strike Vehicle. First, Steffi decides that
the buggy needs to have reinforced roll bars (p. 129,
because soldiers tend to be rough on their equipment.
Second, it will need a radio to keep in touch with headquarters, and installing a radio requires that the vehicle
have an electronics port (p. 139). Last, the vehicle needs
weapon mounts (it is a strike vehicle, after all). Steffi
decides that a ring mount (p. 134) and a passenger-side
pintle mount (p. 134) will do nicely.
Thumbing through Vehicle Customization (beginning on p. 118), Steffi looks up the modifications she
wants and jots down the associated costs. Roll Bars: 0
Design Points, 0 CF, 0 kg Load. Electronics Port: 10
Design Points plus the radio's cost (we'll ignore the radio
for now), 0.5 CF, 0 kg Load (actually the weight of the
radio, but we'll also ignore that for now). Ring mount: 10
Design Points, 1 CF, 25 kg Load. Pintle mount: 1 Design
Point, O CF, 0 kg Load. Total costs for all modifications: 21
Design Points, 1.5 CF (rounded up to 2) and 25 kg Load.
The CF and Load costs are subtracted from the
vehicle's Cargo and Load Ratings respectively, so the
Light Strike Vehicle now has a Cargo Rating of 4 and a
ANO CUSTOMIZATION
Load Rating of 45 kg. The 21 Design Points are added
to the vehicle's Design Point Value, bringing the total
up to 154 points.
Now let's see what Rich comes up with for modifications to his race car. He decides not to take the engine
customization-it carries far too great a risk of engine
failure for the benefits it provides and the amount it will
cost him (and he's putting more than enough nuyen into
this vehicle already). He does, however, choose nitrous
oxide injectors for that quick burst of getaway speed. He
also includes a datajack, rigger adaptation, basic sensors,
* crash cage and some high-performance tires. Cost is
not a problem for Rich; however, he may have trouble
with load and space. Design Points, Cargo Factor and
Load costs are as follows for the mods he's selected:
Rating 6 Nitrous Oxide Injectors: 330 Design Points
(55 Design Points per rating point; 55 x 6 = 330), 1.5 CF
and 15 kg Load.
Datajack Port: 25 Design Points, 10 kg Load.
Rigger Adapation: 35 Design Points.
Sensors, Level 2: 150 Design Points, 1 CF, 25 kg Load.
Crash Cage: 40 Design Points, 10 kg Load.
Rich adds up all his customizations. Total Design
Points = 580, Total CF = 2.5 (his vehicle's maximum is
3), and Total Load = 90 (leaving 50 kg for future customization).
Rich's final Design Point Value for his Formula One car
is 1,239. After finding that total, Rich calculates the cost of
the high-performance tires. This cost, expressed in nuyen
rather than Design Points, is 75¥x Body (3) each, for a total
of 900 nuyen. He's going to be paying a bundle for this
vehicle.
The Wandjina, produced by Commonwealth
Aerospace Systems of Australia, is a fixed-wing UAV
designed to provide close air support to ground troops.
For purposes of vehicle design, it uses the Fixed-Wing
UAV chassis (in the Fixed Wing Aircraft category) and is
* military-grade drone.
The base Mark-Up Factor for the Wandjina is 2.5.
Because it is military grade, a Special Design modifier
of 3 applies; multiplying the base Mark-Up Factor by 3
gives a total result of 7.5. Because the Wandjina is also
* drone, this result is then multiplied by a second
applicable Special Design modifier-0.1-for a final
result of 0.75.
Some Mark-Up Factors, modifiers and multipliers
expressed as ranges of numbers (such as 1 to 2.5). In these ca
the gamemaster may either roll dice to determine the exact v
or simply select a value within the range.
Gamemasters have the final say on the Mark-Up Factors df
vehicles and may increase or decrease Mark-Up Factors as
see fit. Also, gamemasters may round off the final nuyen cost
vehicle to the nearest 500 or thousand to keep the math sim
Satisfied with her vehicle's design, Steffi shows it
to the gamemaster, Diane, who checks it over.
Everything looks fine to her, so Diane computes the
final vehicle cost.
The Light Strike Vehicle has a Car chassis, so the
base Mark-Up Factor is 1. The vehicle has none of the
special features or unusual equipment listed on the
Mark-Up Factors Table, so none of those mark-up modifiers apply (lucky Steffi!). However, the weapon mounts
5. DETERMINE FINAL VEHICLE COST
After the gamemaster and/or player have finished designing the vehicle, the gamemaster multiplies the Design Point Value by the appropriate
Mark-Up Factor to determine the final cost for the
vehicle. He then multiplies that result by 100 to
translate the cost from points into nuyen.
Mark-Up Factors are listed in the Mark-Up
Factors Table. The Chassis Category lists the base
Mark-Up Factor for various vehicle chassis. The
Special Features/Unusual Equipment lists additional
Mark-Up Modifiers conferred by unusual features
(such as smart materials), unique designs or equipment for special purposes. Add these Mark-Up
Modifiers to the base Mark-Up Factor.
The Special Designs section lists multipliers
based on certain special design purposes. If any of
these apply, multiply the total Mark-Up Factor by
the appropriate multiplier. In some cases (such as a
security-grade drone), two or more of these specialdesign multipliers may apply. If this is the case, multiply the Mark-Up Factor by the first multiplier and
then multiply that result by the second multiplier.
Do not add the two multipliers together!

Steffi added classify the vehicle as either security-grade
or military-grade. Because the vehicle is unarmored and
sports relatively light weapons, Diane decides to call it a
security grade vehicle and to apply the lowest possible
security-grade multiplier, which is 2. 1 x 2 = 2, so the
final Mark-Up Factor is 2.
Now Diane multiplies the strike vehicle's Design
Point Value (154) by the Markup Factor. She gets a total
of 308 (154 x 2 = 308). To find this cost in nuyen, she
multiplies 308 by 100, for a total of 30,800 nuyen.
Though Diane could leave this number as is, she decides
to round it down to 30,500 nuyen.

Now let's move on to Rich. Rich is pretty darn
happy with his racing car, which he's named the Johnny
Player Special. He thought about adding a fixed mount,
but he didn't want the mark-up to go sky high ... plus,
he can always add it as a customization later.
Rich's base Mark-Up Factor is also 1, because a
Sports Car chassis definitely qualifies as a car. The smart
materials add a .5 mark-up modifier, for a Mark-Up
Factor of 1.5. Diane decides that none of the secondary
multipliers apply to the Johnny Player Special-it's not a
military or security vehicle, and the luxury classification
really doesn't do it justice. Because a Formula One race
car is still pretty unusual, however, she decides to modify the Mark-Up Factor by adding another 1.0, making
the total modifier 2.5.
Next, Diane multiplies the car's Design Point Value
(1,239) by the final Mark-Up Factor (2.5) for a total
Design Point Value of 3,097.5. Multiplying this result by
100 to convert it into nuyen makes the final cost of the
Johnny Player Special 309,750 nuyen. To simplify the
math, Diane rounds this cost up to 310,000¥ and tosses
in the high-performance tires for free (plus a keen car
deodorizer). Diane and Rich then write down the final

VEHICLE DESIGN OPTIONS
The design options in this section can only be selected during vehicle design. They are not available for vehicle customization. The description of each option explains the option's game
effects and uses the following categories.
Design Cost: The option's design cost is expressed in Design
Points. Some design options have a flat Design Point cost; otherwise, the cost of an option varies according to the selected level
of improvement.
Maximum Rating or Improvement: This category lists the
maximum rating or amount of improvement a vehicle can take in
the design option.
CF Consumed: This number is the Cargo Factor that the
design option takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep
track of the total Cargo Rating of the vehicle during design to
ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed for the chassis chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough CF in its Cargo
Rating to accommodate the design option, it cannot accept the
option. Note that installing options decreases the available cargo
space for storing goodies such as personal gear, luggage, loot and
dragon eggs.
Load Reduction: This listing is the number of kilograms from
the vehicle's Load Rating that the design option takes up. Players
and gamemasters should keep track of the total Load Rating of the
vehicle during design. to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum allowed for the power plant chosen. If the vehicle does not
have enough kilograms in its Load Rating to accommodate the
design option, it cannot accept the option. Note that installing
options decreases the available Load Rating for hauling personal
gear, luggage, assorted loot and the like.
ACCELERATION INCREASE
This option improves a vehicle's Acceleration Rating.
Acceleration may only be increased up to the listed maximum
Acceleration Rating for a given power plant on the Power Plant
Table, p. 167.

TAKEOFF/LANDING PROFILE
All fixed-wing aircraft chassis begin with a Standard takeoff
and landing profile (see the Runway Distances Table, p. 36).
However, players may add STOL or VSTOL capabilities to their
fixed-wing aircraft. STOL costs 250 Design Points; VSTOL costs
400 Design Points. Changing an aircraft's takeoff/landing profile
does not consume CF or reduce Load.
INCREASE FUEL TANK CAPACITY
The Design Point and CF costs of enlarging a vehicle's fuel
tank vary according to the type of engine used in the vehicle.
These costs are listed in the Fuel Tank Capacity Table. Increasing
the size of the fuel tank does not reduce the vehicle's Load Rating.
HANDLING IMPROVEMENT
Vehicle Handling Ratings can be reduced at a cost of 25
Design Points per 1-point reduction. (Lowering a vehicle's
Handling Rating improves the vehicle's handling.) A vehicle's
Handling Rating cannot be reduced to less than half of the chassis' original Handling Rating (rounded up) listed on the Chassis
Table (p. 169). For ground vehicles, Handling reductions must be
applied to the vehicle's on-road or off-road Handling Rating, not
both.

Handling (rounded up)
CF Consumed: 0
Load Reduction: 0 kg
HYDROFOIL CAPABILITY
Hydrofoil capability may be added to all motorboats (except for skiffs). When engaging hydrofoil
capability. the boat elevates on three large "skis"
that eliminate drag on the water, thus improving the
craft's Speed, Acceleration and Signature.
When a boat's hydrofoil is engaged, the vehicle's Speed and
Acceleration Ratings increase by 25 percent (to find the improved
rating, multiply the original rating by 1.25, then round down to
the nearest whole number). Additionally, the boat's Signature
increases by 1. However, the boat's Handling Rating increases by
* when the foils are down.

IMPROVED ECONOMY
The Economy of a vehicle may be improved at a cost of 5
Design Points for each 5-percent improvement (multiply the intial Economy Rating by 1.05 to determine a 5-percent increase).
The Economy Rating may not be increased beyond the maximum
Economy Rating listed in the Power Plant Table.

Rating during vehicle design, players and gamemasters are
advised to keep a tally of the vehicle's total Cargo Rating. Add the
CF consumption of all design options and vehicle modifications
selected, and subtract the total CF Consumed from the vehicle's
Cargo Rating to determine the final Cargo Rating for the vehicle.

LIVING AMENITIES
Living amenities consist of folding bunks, portable toilets,
mini-refrigerators and other features that enable one or more persons to live in the vehicle in relative comfort. Three levels of living amenities are available: basic, improved and high.
Basic living amenities include most of the living features of
someone living a Low Lifestyle. Improved living amenities are
more expensive and include living features from a Middle
Lifestyle. High living amenities are the most expensive and are
comparable to living a High Lifestyle.

To ensure that a vehicle does not exceed its maximum Load
Rating during vehicle design, players and gamemasters are
advised to keep a tally of the vehicle's total Load Rating. Add the

MEDICAL-TREATMENT GEAR
Medical-treatment gear consists of advanced diagnostic electronics, pressurized oxygen tanks and breathing masks, an array
of drugs more sophisticated than a standard medkit and all other
related gear found in a paramedic ambulance.
* character with access to medical-treatment gear receives
one additional die to her Biotech Skill when providing first aid (p.
115, SRII). Additionally, patients treated for Deadly damage with
medical treatment gear during the first hour after injury gain an
additional die on their Body Test for avoiding permanent damage
(p. 113, SRII).
Medical gear with one-patient capacity also increases the
vehicle's passenger seating capacity by 2.5 passengers. Gear with
two-passenger capacity increases the vehicle's passenger seating
capacity by 5 passengers, and so on. Normally, a paramedic occupies the extra passenger seat, but any character may occupy it.

SIGNATURE IMPROVEMENT
* vehicle's Signature may be improved by using alternative
nonmetallic materials in the vehicle's chassis or hull or by redesigning the vehicle's structural profile to reduce its radar crosssection and exhaust emissions.
The gamemaster may set limits for Signature improvement,
but as a general rule, 1 level of increase should be the maximum
allowed for vehicles available to the general public. Security vehicles should be limited to no more than 2 levels of increase, and
increases of 3 or more points should exist almost solely in the
domain of military contractors.

SMART MATERIALS
Smart materials are a revolutionary new state-of-the-art
enhancement available only as a manufacturer's design option.
Smart materials consist of layered piezoelectric compounds that
bend and warp when a certain electrical voltage is applied (more
cool techno jargon to toss around and impress your gaming mates).
If a vehicle is equipped with smart materials, reduce its
Handling by 1 and add a +1 modifier whenever the vehicle makes
* Stress Test (see Stress, p. 25).
Also, smart materials reduce a vehicle's weight and
increase the vehicle's maximum Speed, Acceleration and Load
Ratings by 15 percent. (Simply multiply the initial maximum
from the Power Plant Table, p. 167, by 1.15 and round up to
determine the new maximum.)
Note that smart materials do not automatically increase a
vehicle's Speed, Acceleration and Load Ratings-instead, they
raise the limits on those ratings. A player must pay for the Speed
Increase, Acceleration Increase and Load Increase design options
to actually increase the ratings.
Helicopters equipped with smart materials also increase their
Signature by 1, because a smart-material drive shaft eliminates the
rotor's mechanical actuators that cause the audible "eggbeater"
noise and increase the radar cross section.
Smart materials cost 100 Design Points, raise the vehicle's
Mark-Up Factor by 50 and increase by 4 the Availability of the
vehicle.

AND CUSTOMIZATION
STRUCTURAL AGILITY
This option is available only for vehicles that incorporate the
drive-by-wire modification (see Drive-by-Wire Systems. p. 124).
The computer controls of a drive-by-wire system allow designers
to push the development envelope by creating vehicles so
dynamically unstable that an unassisted (meta)human driver/pilot
cannot control them. However, the digital-control software can
make minute adjustments many times per microsecond, thus rendering the vehicle stable through the sheer quickness of the
microtronics.
Each level of Structural Agility provides a +1 bonus to the
character's Reaction Attribute when driving the vehicle. This
Reaction bonus also applies to a rigger's Control Pool, so it effectively raises the Control Pool by 1 when the character is rigging
the vehicle.
The maximum Structural Agility level equals the vehicle's
Drive-by-Wire level.
* vehicle must be fitted with a drive-by-wire system during
vehicle design to accommodate Structural Agility. This option
cannot be added if the vehicle is fitted with a drive-by-wire system during vehicle customization. Additionally, increases to a
vehicle's drive-by-wire system during vehicle customization do
not increase the levels of Structural Agility it may accept.
Design Cost: 150 points per level (plus the Drive-by-Wire
modification)
Maximum Rating: Number of levels purchased in the Drive-byWire modification
CF Consumed: 0
Load Reduction: 0 kg
VEHICLE CUSTOMIZATION
Vehicle customization may be performed after a vehicle has
been designed and manufactured. Unlike design, customization
requires a skilled mechanic and any required parts. That's rightno need for millions of nuyen or a team of overpaid engineersjust the right parts, the ingenious know-how of your friendly
neighborhood shadow mechanic and a little bit of time is all it
takes. During vehicle customization, the following types of modifications may be performed: engine, control systems and protective-systems modifications, Signature enhancers, weapon-mount
modifications, electronic-systems modifications, and miscellaneous modfications/accessories.
To customize a vehicle, the character first has to procure the
parts. The character can do this however he likes-through a fixer,
contacts, favors and so on. Use the rules for obtaining equipment,
including Availability and Street Index, published in SRII and the
Shadowrun Companion to resolve parts searches.
After obtaining the required parts, the character (or his
mechanic) must install the modification by making an Installation
Test with an appropriate Build/Repair Skill (or skills). The required
skill, Installation Test target number and required base time for
each modification are listed in the modification's description. To
find the actual time it takes to perform the modification, divide
the listed base time by the number of successes generated on the
Installation Test.
WORKING TIME
As stated in The Mechanic Contact (p. 19), mechanics generally work eight hours a day, five days a week-and they expect
to be paid for it! Any more time spent during a work day or work
week is overtime and will be charged as such.
If a player character elects to perform a modification himself,
he must deal with a different set of restrictions-namely, the
amount of time he can devote to the work.
As a rule of thumb (which gamemasters may alter), a character can spend up to six hours a day working on a vehicle and stil
have time available to meet with contacts, pursue legwork, pay
bills and so on. Any more time spent on customization prevents
the character from meeting social obligations (resulting in irate
landlords, torqued-off friends and significant others, and uncooperative contacts). In fact, if a character spends more than twelve
hours performing customization, he cuts into his bodily sustenance time and faces the consequences of sleep deprivation, malnutrition, lack of exercise and so on.
If using the training rules from the Shadowrun Companion,
keep in mind also that a training day consumes 4 hours a day in
study. A character who tries to juggle training and customization
has a lot of drek on his plate and will suffer the previously mentioned consequences.
WEIGHT AND SPACE RESTRICTIONS
Certain modifications consume cargo space or Load. Not only
does this cut into the amount of personnel or cargo a vehicle can
carry, but it also limits the modifications a vehicle can carry.
because the vehicle cannot exceed its Cargo or Load ratings.
If desired, riggers and their mechanics can scrape up some
extra CF by using up the vehicle's "leg room" and utility space. A
rigger can scrape up an extra 1.5 CF (rounded down) for every
passenger seat squeezed into the vehicle this way.
However, scraping up extra CF in this manner means that
equipment is shoved into areas normally reserved for elbow, les
or head room. This makes the vehicle less comfortable and imposes an additional +3 modifier to all Damage Resistance Tests that
the character must make to resist crash or collision damage
Furthermore, passengers must resist 4L Stun damage during
every round of vehicle combat because they bump and slam into
equipment during extreme maneuvering.
Finally, if and when a highway trooper pulls over a rigger fol,
uh, flying too low through the local speed zone, the cop is much
more likely to notice that the rigger's vehicle is "non-standard.
and may ask some rather pointed questions (for example, "Do you
understand your rights as I have read them to you?").
INCORPORATING MODIFICATIONS
DURING VEHICLE DESIGN
Any of the listed modifications may be installed during the
vehicle design process. In this case, no Installation Tests
required. The character simply pays the required Design Cost ant
reduces the vehicle's CF and Load by the CF and Load requirements listed in the modification descriptions.

Design Points. Generally, the cost of a modification varies according to the selected level of improvement, but some modifications
have a flat Design Point cost.
Maximum Rating or Improvement: This lists the maximum
rating or amount of improvement a vehicle can take in the modification.
CF Consumed: This listing is the CF that the modification
takes up. Players and gamemasters should keep track of the total
Cargo Rating of the vehicle to ensure that it does not exceed the
maximum for the chassis chosen. If the vehicle does not have
enough CF in its Cargo Rating to accommodate the modification,
it cannot accept the modification. Note that installing modifications may decrease available cargo space for storing goodies such
as personal gear, luggage, loot and dragon eggs.
Load Reduction: This lists the number of kilograms from the
vehicle's Load Rating that the modification takes up. Players and
gamemasters should keep track of the total Load Rating of the
vehicle to ensure that it does not exceed the maximum for the
power plant chosen. If the vehicle does not have enough kilograms in its Load Rating to accommodate the modification, it cannot accept the modification. Installing modifications may decrease
the available Load Rating for hauling personal gear, luggage,
assorted loot and the like.
ENGINE MODIFICATIONS
Engine modifications affect a vehicle's power-producing
tems. Some modifications improve the performance of the eng
and enhance Speed, Acceleration or Load. Others provides
ondary means of generating power to propel the vehicle.
Engine Customization
Engine customization involves a radical re-design of
existing engine to perform at levels well beyond normal. Eng
customization enables a vehicle to exceed the standard maxim
Acceleration, Speed or Load Ratings for that particular type
vehicle, but at the cost of bypassing numerous performances
guards and thereby greatly increasing the risk of engine fail
during operation.
Engine customization is usually a vehicle modification,
gamemasters may also use it as a design option to reflect pro
type models that have not yet been fully tested. During the ve
cle design process, engine customization may increase a vehic
Speed Rating above the normal maximum specified on the Po
Plant Table (p. 167).
Engine customization is measured in levels. Each
increases either the Speed Rating by 30, Acceleration by 2
Load by (Body x 50) kilograms. Each rating must be raised se
rately-in other words, three separate customizations are need
to increase a vehicle's Speed, Acceleration and Load all by
increment (+30, +2 and + (Body x 50).
To determine the risk of a customized engine failing du
operation, the gamemaster makes a secret Build/Repair Test.

the vehicle. These Stress Points cannot be reduced unless a far
ry-standard engine replaces the customized engine.
Design Specifications
Design Cost: For the first level of customization, multiply
power plant's Design Point cost by 1.25 to determine the
tomization cost. For each additional level, add another .5 to
Design Point multiplier and repeat the calculation.

GridLink™ Power
The GridLink™ system provides power to electrical cars
through magnetic induction coils buried a few inches under the
pavement in cities. Low-friction runners along the vehicle's underbelly induce an electrical current from the magnetic field produced by the roadbed coils. This modification is available only to
ground vehicles, not including drones.
Vehicles equipped with GridLink™ need not worry about
power consumption while traveling in the better areas of a city
(Security Rating B or higher), so long as they stay under the local
speed limit. The GridLink™ system is designed to provide adequate power for vehicles at normal traffic speeds only. If vehicles
exceed the speed limit, GridLink™ cannot provide enough induction power, and so the vehicle must rely on its own power source.
Sometimes, especially in larger cities during rush hour, the
GridLink™ power grid overloads and crashes, leaving many
motorists stranded (or at least those who have not recharged their
onboard vehicle batteries lately).
GridLink™ users must pay a monthly usage charge based on
the general weight of their vehicles. For standard vehicles, this
charge amounts to a number of nuyen per month equal to the
vehicle's Body Rating, multiplied by 100. For motorcycles, the
amount is the cycle's Body multiplied by 25. For trucks and tractors, the figure is the vehicle's Body multiplied by 250.

Nitrous Oxide Injectors
Nitrous oxide injectors inject nitrous oxide into the air compressor of gasoline and diesel engines, providing a short boost to
power output. During vehicle combat, a driver may attempt to
use this device to assist in performing the Accelerating/Braking
action. When making an Accelerating/Braking Success Test, the
player rolls an additional number of dice equal to the level of the
injector.
Additionally, the player may use the device to increase his
vehicle's Speed to its standard Speed Rating multiplied by 2.5.
However, the vehicle will decelerate by its Acceleration Rate each
subsequent turn afterward, until the vehicle's speed falls below its
standard Speed Rating.
Nitrous oxide injectors contain a number of "charges" equal
to the injector's level per use (naturally, a driver can opt to use a
lower rating to conserve charges). Charges are stored in a pressurized gas cylinder, which can hold up to 20 charges.

SunCell™ Power
The SunCell™ system consists of externally mounted solar
cells that provide electrical power to the vehicle on a sunny day
at a rate equal to the vehicle's Body multiplied by 25 PF per hour.
The system's power output is reduced by half in cloudy weather
and reduced to zero at night or in heavily overcast weather.
Tractors using this modification must mount their SunCell™ panels on all trailers they are towing.
SunCell™ systems are compatible with electric-engine driven
vehicles. The accessory is not available for motorcycles.

CUSTOMIZATION
Turbocharging/Superconductive Drive
Turbocharging improves the speed and acceleration of a
methane, gasoline or diesel engine by using a turbine to compress
the air that enters the engine's carburetor. A similar modification,
called a "superconductive drive," provides electric engines with
the same performance boosts. For convenience, both modifications follow the same rules and are collectively referred to as "turbocharging.
Each level of turbocharging increases a vehicle's Speed by 15
and its Acceleration by 10, and reduces its Signature by 1. The
Economy of the vehicle also decreases. To caculate the reduced
Economy Rating, multiply the vehicle's initial Economy Rating by
.95. If adding turbocharging during vehicle design, apply the multiplier to the vehicle's Economy Rating after Economy effects of all
other design options have been applied.
Aircraft (except for electrically powered aircraft) cannot be
turbocharged, as their engines incorporate turbocharging as standard equipment.

CONTROL SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS
Control-system modifications affect the operation or handling
of the vehicle in one way or another. Some modifications enhance
ease of control and thus reduce the vehicle's Handling Rating.
Others, such as rigger adaptation or autonavigation systems, provide alternate or supplementary methods of controlling a vehicle.
Adjusted Controls
Standard manual vehicle controls (steering wheels, foot pedals, dashboards and so on) are arranged to accommodate
humans, elves and orks.
Dwarfs and trolls, because of their unusual sizes, have difficulty using such controls. Dwarf legs are too short to reach foot
pedals and most dashboard controls will be out of a dwarf's reach.
Likewise, trolls attempting to drive will experience difficulty when
attempting to manipulate standard-sized controls with their huge
hands and feet. Adjusted controls are modified to fit the
ergonomic needs of dwarfs and trolls and solve these problems.
If a dwarf or troll attempts to drive a vehicle with standard
controls, he receives +3 target modifiers on all driving-related
Success Tests. Likewise, if humans, elves or orks attempt to drive
vehicles with adjusted controls, they receive +3 target modifiers
on all driving-related Success Tests. Furthermore, dwarfs cannot
drive vehicles with controls adjusted for trolls, and vice versa.
Note that size does not matter when driving a rigged vehicle
using a datajack.
Adjusted controls are also available for any metahumans with
disabilities that prevent them from using standard controls.
Note that vehicles with adjusted controls may be harder to
come by, more expensive or simply unavailable in areas unfriendly to metahumans.

Autonavigation Systems
Autonavigation systems are available for most vehicles. The
effects of each basic type of system-Rating 1, Rating 2 and Rating
3-are described in the following entries.
The Autonav Rating also represents extra dice the rigger can
add to standard Driving Tests. In combat, however, the autonav
system works against the character because its safety-conscious
programming runs counter to vehicle combat. In this case, the
system's rating is added to test target numbers. See the The
Driving Test in Standard Vehicle Operations (p. 20) and the
Vehicle Combat section for more information on these effects.
Rating 2, Rating 3 and Rating 4 autonav systems are also
capable of controlling a vehicle without input from the driver. In
these cases, assume that the vehicle has the appropriate Vehicle
Control Skill at a rating equal to its Autonav Rating.
VEHICLE DESIGN AND CUS

Rating 1 Autonav
Rating 1 autonav consists of rudimentary collision detecbon/avoidance systems. It comes with Level 0 Sensors, which
consist primarily of ultrasound and basic radar systems that detect
the presence of other objects. However, the Rating 1 autonav system cannot control a vehicle by itself.
Rating 1 autonav is the only type of autonav that can be fitted
to a motorcycle that does not have rigger-control gear installed.

Rating 2 Autonav
Rating 2 autonav is capable of self-navigation
-LOSTON
and is equipped with radio transponders that can
communicate with a traffic-control grid system, such as
the the European ALI system. After receiving traffic data
from such systems, the autonav can suggest alternate routes to
* destination. Using a standard map chip (available for all major
urban areas, 25 nuyen each), a Rating 2 autonav system can also
follow any route mapped out along terrain not classified as rough.
Rough terrain (where off-road penalties apply) rapidly overwhelms the system's collision-avoidance software and all relevant
target numbers are doubled.

CAND CUSTOMIZATION
Contingency Maneuver Controls (CMCs)
Contingency maneuver controls (CMCs) consist of redundant
wiring, secondary circuit breakers and backup systems. CMCs
allow a vehicle to ignore, to a limited extent, the effects of vehicle damage on driving and control of the vehicle.
CMCs allow the vehicle to ignore the effects of a number of
boxes of vehicle damage equal to the rating of the CMC system.
For example, a vehicle with Rating 3 CMCs does not suffer any
damage modifiers when taking Light or Moderate vehicle damage. Once the damage passes the Moderate level, however, all
damage and Initiative modifiers apply per standard rules.
Note that even if a vehicle has Rating 9 CMCs, it will be
destroyed when it suffers damage at the Deadly level. CMCs keep
the vehicle running at peak performance instead of slowly
degrading performance as damage accumulates, up until the
point of destruction.
CMCs do not compensate for damage modifiers applied to
riggers suffering from Physical or Mental Damage.

Drive-by-Wire Systems
Drive-by-wire systems substitute advanced computer-controlled maneuvering systems for standard mechanical or basic
electronic steering controls.
Drive-by-wire systems are available at levels 1, 2 and 3. Each
level of drive-by-wire reduces a vehicle's Handling by 1.
Additionally, the system reduces a vehicle's overall weight and
provides a one-time increase to the vehicle's Acceleration, Speed
and Load Ratings.
To calculate the one-time increase, multiply the desired rating by .10. If desired, the multiplier can be split among two or
three ratings. For example, the player may increase the
Acceleration, Speed and Load Ratings by the following amounts:
Acceleration Rating x .03, Speed Rating x .03 and Load Rating x
.04. Or the player may increase the Acceleration Rating by the
drive-by-wire system's level multiplied by .06. and the Speed
Rating by the system's level multiplied by .04.
The multiplier increase is not cumulative per level of driveby-wire. A vehicle with a Rating 3 drive-by-wire system receives
the same .10 multiplier as a vehicle with a Rating 1 drive-bywire system.
To install a drive-by-wire system as a vehicle customization,
the rigger or mechanic must make three separate successful tests
an appropriate Vehicle B/R (4) Test, a Computer (4) Test, and an
Electronics (4) Test. Successes from all three tests may be used to
reduce the base time for the modification.

Off-Road Suspension
Off-road suspension improves off-road Handling at the
expense of on-road Handling, Speed and fuel consumption. This
modification is available only to wheeled ground vehicles and is
compatible with drive-by-wire systems.
Each level of off-road suspension reduces the vehicle's offroad Handling Rating by 1, while increasing the on-road Handling
Rating by 1. The installation of off-road suspension, regardless of
how many levels of improvement are made, reduces on-road
Speed by 15 and off-road Speed by 30. It also increases the vehicle's Economy by a varying amount, depending on the type of
vehicle (see Off-Road Suspension Table, below).
During vehicle design, levels of off-road suspension are not
subject to the limit of the chassis' original Handling Rating.
However, the modification cannot raise or lower the vehicle's ratings by more than 2.

Remote Pilot Advanced Programming
The advanced programming option is required if the character desires a Pilot Rating greater than 1.
* Level 1 Pilot is a simple system that does exactly what it's
told and is easily confused.
* Level 2 Pilot is an enhanced system with limited autonomy
and the ability to interpret commands with slight latitude. Level 2
Pilot programming is the highest-level pilot system that the public can buy without a security license.
* Level 3 Pilot is an advanced system and possesses roughly the same intelligence and comprehension level as an average
metahuman. Level 3 Pilots are generally found on the gray or
shadow markets.
Level 4 Pilot systems are security-grade drone pilots. Level 4
systems employ sophisticated expert systems and fuzzy-logic
controls that give a drone the equivalent tactical intelligence of a
well-trained company man.
Level 5 Pilots are military-grade drone pilots. Possessing the
latest advances in expert systems, fuzzy logic and neural-network
pattern recognition, Level 5 Pilots are the equal of battle-savvy
soldiers or pilots who've logged more than a thousand hours of
flight duty. Level 5 is also the highest known Pilot level in production (rumors abound of Level 6 or higher Pilots that employ
proto-artificial intelligence, but no proof-definitive or circumstantial-exists to back up these rumors).

PROTECTIVE SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS
Protective-system modifications help protect a vehicle and its
passengers. Protective systems include vehicle armor, crash
cages, EnviroSeal™ and life-support systems.
Standard Armor
Standard vehicle armor consists of hardened ceramic and
metallic panels that protect both vehicle and passengers from
attacks. Each level of armor increases the Armor Rating of the
vehicle by 1 point.
Armor adds weight as well. Each level of armor adds (Body
* Body x 5) kilograms to the vehicle, which are counted against
the vehicle's Load Rating. Vehicles cannot carry more armor than
their Load Ratings allow.
Armor also increases a vehicle's Handling Rating, because
maneuvering vehicles becomes more difficult as the vehicle's
weight increases. For every 6 points of Armor added, increase the
Handling of the vehicle by 1.

Concealed Armor
Even casual observers can easily discern standard armor on a
vehicle. Concealed armor is hidden in a vehicle's interior spaces
so that anyone attempting to detect it must make a Perception
Test. To determine the test target number, divide the Armor
Rating by 3, then subtract the result from 9 and round up.
Concealed armor reduces the interior cargo space; if a vehicle's available cargo space cannot accommodate the desired
Armor Rating, the character must either reduce the Armor Rating
or use standard armor.
Concealed armor is not compatible with standard armor.
(After all, what's the point of installing concealed armor, when
installing standard armor on top of it blatantly gives away the fact
that the vehicle is armored?)

Ablative Armor
Ablative armor consists of dozens or hundreds of small,
square, ceramic-metallic plates, roughly 10 centimeters long on
each side. When a projectile or explosion strikes a vehicle, some
of the ablative plates blow off the vehicle and deflect part of the
damaging energy of the attack.
Ablative armor adds twice its level to a vehicle's Armor
Rating, to a maximum equal to the vehicle's Body. When struck
by a weapon that has a Power greater than 3 times the total modified Armor Rating, reduce the ablative armor level by 1. Ablative
armor is not hardened and thus does not stage down the damage
code of attacks.
Installing or replacing ablative armor plates takes 6 hours and
does not require any Skill Test. Ablative armor is not available as
* design option, cannot be installed on aircraft and is not concealable.
Regardless of its level, ablative armor reduces the vehicle's
available Load by (Body x 100) kilograms. Ablative armor does
not consume CF. A vehicle with ablative armor is automatically
considered security- or military-grade.

EnviroSeal™ System
The EnviroSeal™ system provides a vehicle with gas-tight (or
watertight) seals. Note that opening windows, doors, or hatches
breaks the integrity of the seal for as long as the windows, doors
or hatches remain open. Note also that this system does not provide life support for a vehicle's occupants. For submersible operations, a vehicle's engine compartment must be sealed separately.
Light damage to a sealed vehicle breaches the seal.
Emergency slap-patches that can handle holes made by light
damage are available at a modest cost of 5 nuyen each. Of course
some contamination may penetrate even if the hole is sealed relatively quickly. Moderate vehicle damage or worse cannot be
sealed without work on the vehicle.
EnviroSeal™ is not available for motorcycles.
Cabin overpressurization: This additional option is available
with all EnviroSeal™ systems. A cabin-overpressurization system
uses air pumps to increase the air pressure inside a vehicle's
cabin, so that external contaminants are kept out of the vehicle
* window, door or hatch is opened or a light-damage breach
occurs. This option is commonly incorporated in emergency rescue, decontamination and reconnaissance vehicles designed for
use in hazardous, toxic or NBC (Nuclear/Biological/Chemical) contamination areas.
Cabin overpressurization does not work underwater or if the
vehicle sustains Moderate or greater damage.

Smart Armor Systems (SAS)
Smart, or "proactive," armor systems use small hexagonal
explosive cells, each approximately 5 centimeters in diameter and
10 centimeters high. A fine wire mesh of sensitive electrical circuitry is suspended approximately 1 meter away from the skin of
the vehicle. Whenever a projectile penetrates the wire mesh, the
penetration is relayed to a system computer that instantaneously
determines the size and impact location of the projectile, then
detonates a portion of the explosive cells to offset or deflect the
projectile's impact.
In game terms, whenever a projectile strikes his smartarmor-equipped vehicle, the player controlling the vehicle rolls 2
dice, adds the results together and compares that result to the
Activation Target Number. The first time a projectile strikes the
vehicle, the Activation Target Number is 3. For each successive hit
(regardless of whether or not it causes damage), increase the target number by 1. Note that a burst fire or full autofire attack
counts as one "hit" for these purposes.
If the roll result is greater than or equal to the Activation
Target Number, the smart armor reduces the damage code of all
attacks by one level. Standard reductions for standard munition
attacks against vehicles apply as well, so the damage codes of
standard bullets and explosives are reduced by two levels (D to
M, S to L, M or lower to no damage). Damage codes for anti-vehicle munitions are reduced by one level.
Dangerous Dave is a Desert Rat marine based at
the Twenty-Nine Palms Combat Center in the Mojave
Desert. Dave is driving the Murdilizer, a Ferrari
Appaloosa equipped with SAS, into a running gun battle with some Aztechnology-backed mercs attempting
to grab some telesma material from the Joshua Tree
National Monument.
During the first Combat Turn. the Murdilizer takes a
hit from a barrage of heavy machine gun fire (damage
10S, boosted up to 16D to account for full autofire). The
Appaloosa hasn't been hit yet, so Dave rolls 2D6 against
an Activation Target Number 3. The test generates a 5,
so the smart armor stages the damage down to 16S.
Additionally, the machine gun is not firing anti-vehicle
munitions, so the damage is staged down another level
to 16M (per standard vehicle damage rules, p. 53).
Consequently, Dave makes the Appaloosa's Resistance
Test against 16M damage (minus Armor modifiers).
During the next Combat Turn, an Aguilar attack helicopter pops up over a mesa and lobs a Block II Outlaw
AVM (damage 20D) at the Murdilizer. The Appaloosa
has already taken one hit, so the Activation Target
Number increases from 3 to 4. Dave rolls 2D6 but gets
only a 2. The SAS fails to function, and the AVM hits the
Appaloosa full on. To compound the bad luck, the
Outlaw is an anti-vehicle munition, so its damage code
is not staged down against vehicles. Dave must therefore make a Damage Resistance Test against 20D damage, with half the Murdilizer's Armor Rating applying
against the attack's Power. (Now you know why the
other jarheads call him "Dangerous Dave.")
After a vehicle's smart armor has taken a hit, the character
can replace the expended explosive cells. Doing so returns the
Activation Target Number to 3 for the next attack against the
vehicle. The repair takes approximately eight hours and requires
no Skill Test.
To install smart armor as a vehicle customization, the rigger
or mechanic must make three successful Skill Tests-a
Demolitions Build/Repair Test, an Electronics Test and a Computer
Test. Smart armor is not available for vehicles with Body Ratings
lower than 4, and it cannot be concealed.
If smart armor is incorporated during the vehicle design
process, the vehicle is considered military-grade.

SIGNATURE MODIFICATIONS
Signature modifications reduce or mask a vehicle's thermographic or radar profile and make detecting the vehicle more difficult for sensor systems.
Thermal Baffles
Thermal baffles are heat-blocking and absorbing materials
added to the chassis of a vehicle to reduce its thermal signature.
This makes detecting and locking on to the vehicle harder for
infrared sensors.
Thermal baffles are available only for vehicles with gasoline,
methane, diesel and jet engines. Like vehicle armor, thermal baffles are heavy materials. Each point of thermal baffle weighs (Body
* 50) kilograms, which counts against the vehicle's Load Rating.
Players also need to keep separate track of the total rating of
thermal masking on a vehicle, because that rating serves as a positive modifier on any Perception Tests made against the vehicle
that involve non-vehicle thermographic detection techniques.

Active Thermal Masking
Active thermal masking is a high-powered coolant system
that temporarily absorbs heat generated by the vehicle's power
plant. This modification is available only for customized gasoline,
methane, diesel and jet engines, except for motorcycle engines
(see Engine Modifications, p. 120). Each level of engine customization allows one level of active masking, and each level of
active masking increases the vehicle's Signature by 1.
During operation, the vehicle loses 15 meters per turn to its
Speed Rating for each level of masking activated, and the vehicle
cannot exceed its adjusted Speed Rating. The system runs for a
duration equal to (60 - [masking x 5]) minutes. Running the
coolant system longer than the indicated duration produces I
Stress Point per minute and forces the vehicle to make a Stress
Test each minute (see Stress, p. 25). Characters can switch off the
masking system before the end of the specified duration.
At the end of the duration, the masking system must shut
down for ten minutes to vent accumulated heat. During this period the vehicle Signature falls to 2, regardless of any other
Signature modifiers in effect.

Radar-Absorbent Materials (RAM)
Radar-absorbent materials consist of special coatings and
enamels that absorb radar signals and convert them into heat of
small magnetic fields. As a result, the vehicle reflects back very Ilttle radar energy, making it harder for sensors to detect and lod
on to it. Each level of RAM coating applied to a vehicle increases
its Signature by 1, up to a maximum improvement of +3.
RAM is extremely hard to obtain, even for licensed security
agencies. Normally, RAM is available to military agencies
Therefore, if players or gamemasters incorporate RAM as part of
vehicle during vehicle design, the vehicle is automatically consid
ered military grade.

VEHICLE WEAPON MOUNTS
Vehicle weapon mounts use the weight of the vehicle to stabilize the weapon against the vehicle's movement and to provide
some recoil resistance as well. Though ostensibly licensed only to
law enforcement, private security and military organizations, a
number of general-purpose vehicle-weapon mounts are available
on the shadow market. Certain weapons require certain special
mounts; those requirements are described in the appropriate
weapon descriptions.
* vehicle's Body Rating determines the number of hardpoints and firmpoints it can accommodate. In turn, the vehicle's
hardpoints and firmpoints determine the number of weapon
mounts the vehicle can accommodate. See Body Rating and
Weapon Mounts, p. 22.
Each hardpoint is worth 2 points and each firmpoint counts
for 1 point. The total point value of all the hardpoints and firmpoints on a vehicle cannot exceed the vehicle's Body Rating.
Heavy weapons (MMGs and larger) and vehicle weapons must be
mounted on hardpoints. LMGs and small arms (assault rifles and
smaller) can be mounted on firmpoints.
Motorcycles with medium or larger sidecars and sufficient
Body can accommodate 1 hardpoint. The hardpoint can only take
* forward-firing fixed weapon mount and must be in the sidecar
(see Sidecars, p. 146).
If players or gamemasters incorporate weapon mounts during vehicle design, the vehicle receives the additional Mark-Up
Factor multiplier for security- or military-grade vehicles.
Firearm Conversion Kits
* firearm conversion kit is required for mounting any personal firearm, from pistols to man-portable heavy weapons to
fixed mounts or turrets. Conversion kits are not required to mount
firearms on pintle or ring mounts.
To convert a firearm for mounting on a vehicle, the character
must make an appropriate Weapon B/R (4) Test. The base time is
12 hours. Additionally, the character needs a Weapons Kit (see p.
244, SRII) to make the conversion.
Any accessories, features or properties that are part of the
weapon are also available when it is mounted as a vehicle
weapon. However, external weapon accessories that are not part
of the weapon cannot be fitted onto the converted weapon, with
the exception of the smartgun system, which must be installed
internally (p. 241, SRII). Converted firearms do not consume CF
(though the mounts onto which they are fitted do).
Firearm conversion kits are not needed for weapons specifically designed to be mounted on vehicles, such as the water cannon from SRII, the Ares Firelance™ vehicle laser from Fields of
Fire, or any of the vehicle weapons from this sourcebook.
Fixed Mounts
* fixed mount is a hardpoint or firmpoint with a weapon permanently affixed to it. Fixed mounts fire in a fixed arc (no more
than 5 degrees to either side, up or down), so a driver "aims" the
fixed-mount weapon by moving his vehicle. Fixed mounts commonly face forward or to the rear; side-facing mounts tend to
interfere with a vehicle's handling. (Add the weapon's recoil to
the vehicle's normal Handling Rating when a side-facing mount is
fired. The driver must make a Driving Test against the increased
Handling Rating or crash. Double the recoil modifiers for hovercraft; triple them for watercraft).
Single fixed-mount weapons must be placed directly along
the vehicle's center line. Twin mounts may sit either side-by-side
along the center line or may be placed on the left and right fairings of the vehicle. If different weapons are mounted on fixed
mounts, both must sit side-by-side along the center line, to limit
recoil imbalance (which is really bad for vehicle handling).
Fixed mounts reduce recoil modifiers by half before applying recoil compensation from any accessories. Thus, they cancel
the double-recoil modifier for heavy weapons. Fixed mounts
may be remotely operated by a gunner or by the rigger jacked
into the vehicle.
Fixed mounts may be configured as external or internal
mounts. External fixed mounts are easily seen by casual observers
and are not protected by a vehicle's armor. Consequently, external mounts decrease a vehicle's Signature by 1.
Weapons on internal mounts are protected by the vehicle's
armor and receive the benefit of Concealability (except when firing), but do not decrease the vehicle's Signature. An observer
who makes a successful Perception (3) Test can spot an internal
weapon mount but will not immediately deduce what the mount
is used for. During vehicle combat, the controlling character must
spend a Complex Action to extend or stow a weapon on an internal mount. While a weapon is armed, it is not protected by the
vehicle's armor and it reduces the vehicle's Signature by 1.

Gunnery Recoil Adjusters
The gunnery recoil adjuster is a unique form of recoil compensation available for vehicle weapons. The adjuster consists of
high-precision micro-actuators that replace the weapon mount's
servo-motors. When the weapon is fired, the actuators lower the
weapon in minute increments to compensate for the effects of recoil.
In game terms, recoil adjusters work in the same way as standard recoil compensators do (see Recoil Compensation, p. 90,
SRII). Each level of recoil adjuster negates 1 point of recoil.
Gunnery recoil adjusters are available for fixed mounts and
turrets only. Recoil adjusters are not compatible with vehicle
gyro-stabilization, because the rotational momentum interferes
with the micro-actuators' minute adjustments.

VEHICLE DESIGN AND CUG
1
External Missile and Rocket Mounts
Because of their size, missiles and rockets use slightly different rules for fixed weapon mounts. Though every missile and
rocket firing system takes up one firmpoint, the number and types
of missiles or rockets carried in different systems vary, depending
on the size of the vehicle.
For ground vehicles, externally mounted missiles and rockets
sit on roof-rack mounts. Civilian vehicles armed in this manner
must also have roll bars for recoil stability. A vehicle may carry a
number of missiles or rockets equal to its Body Rating in this manner. Rockets and missiles mounted externally receive no protection from the vehicle's armor and they reduce the Signature of the
vehicle by 1, regardless of the number of missiles or rockets
mounted.
Aircraft and helicopters generally carry rockets and missiles
on pinions under their wings, fairings and fuselages. An aircraft
may carry a number of external mounts equal to its Body Rating.
Every two external mounts installed on an aircraft reduce its
Signature by 1. Each aircraft mount may carry up to 300 kilograms
of missiles or rockets.
In all cases, remember that a vehicle cannot carry more missiles or rockets than its Load Rating allows. And missiles-particularly anti-vehicle missiles-can be very heavy.
Internal Missile and Rocket Mounts
Internal rocket and missile mounts do not decrease a vehicle's
Signature and receive the benefit of the vehicle's armor protection.
An internal rocket or missile mount takes up one firmpoint.
However, the number of missiles or rockets a vehicle can carry is
limited by the vehicle's CF. For every 3 CF, a vehicle can carry 2
missiles or rockets. The mounting actuators consume an additional 2 CF.
To fire an internally stored rocket or missile, the driver must
open the weapon bay door and arm the rocket or missile. While
the missile is armed and ready to fire, the vehicle's Signature
decreases by 1, until the munition is fired or is stowed back in its
storage place. Arming or stowing a munition requires one
Complex Action.
In all cases, remember that a vehicle cannot carry more missiles
or rockets than its Load Rating will allow. An aircraft or helicopter can
carry a number of internal mounts equal to half its Body Rating.
Pintle Mounts
Pintle mounts, the simplest mounts available, consist of simple reinforced holes and swivels mounted into the side of a vehicle. Pintle mounts accept any firmpoint-sized weapon. Firing arcs
are generally 60 degrees to the left and right and 30 degrees up
and down (which allows the vehicle to engage low-flying aircraft
at a height of less than half the weapon's long-range value). Pintle
mounts count as one firmpoint.
To mount a weapon on or remove a weapon from a pintle
mount requires a Complex Action; if the vehicle is moving, it
also requires a Quickness (3) Test. Drone pilots and riggers
jacked into the vehicle cannot remotely control pintle mounts.
Weapons in a pintle mount receive the equivalent of 2 points of
recoil compensation.

Ring Mounts
Ring mounts are a step up from the basic pintle mount. Ring
mounts consist of a freely rotating ring set on the top of a vehicle,
with a tripod assembly attached to the ring; the gunner stands in
the middle of the ring to fire the weapon. The ring rotates in a full
circle, but its vertical traversing remains 30 degrees upwards or
downwards. Mounting or dismounting a weapon from a ring
mount requires a Complex Action, as well as a Quickness (3) Test
if the vehicle is moving.
TO CUSTOMIZATION
Ring mounts may only be mounted on hardtop vehicles or on
open-top or convertible vehicles equipped with roll bars. Ring
mounts installed on helicopters are actually door guns, which
require the gunner to open the door on one side to fire out (and
also exposes the pilot, crew and the rest of the helicopter interior
to incoming fire).
Ring mounts count as a hardpoint and can mount any manportable heavy weapon, as well as LMGs. Ring mounts cannot be
remotely controlled by a drone pilot or a rigger jacked into the
vehicle. Weapons on a ring mount receive the equivalent of 6
points of recoil compensation.

Smartlink Integration Kits
The smartlink integration kit is an interface that connects
smartgun-equipped weapons mounted in fixed mounts and turrets with gunners who are equipped with smartlink cyberware.
Without the integration kit, smartgun-equipped weapons mounted in fixed mounts or turrets do not gain the benefit of the
smartlink during Manual Gunnery Tests.
Remember that gunners must have smartlink cyberware to
take full advantage of the smartlink system. If the gunner using a
vehicle smartgun does not have smartlink cyberware, treat the
gunner as if he is wearing smartgoggles (see p. 90, SRII).
The gunner need not be jacked into the vehicle to take
advantage of the smartlink system. The smartlink integration kit
also contains palm-induction links for weapon controls.
Remember that smartlink modifiers do not apply to SensorEnhanced Gunnery or Missile Attack Tests.
The smartlink integration kit is not necessary for weapons
mounted on pintle or ring mounts.

Turrets
Turrets are motorized, armored ring mounts. Turrets provide
weapons with armor protection but also increase a vehicle's profile. Consequently, a turret reduces a vehicle's Signature by 1.
Civilian vehicles can mount turrets only if they are already
equipped with roll bars.
Turrets come in six sizes: mini, small, medium, large and
extra-large. Mini turrets, which are found on large drones and
pickup-sized trucks, take up one hardpoint and have a Weapon
Value of 2. Small turrets, found on most anti-riot vehicles, take up
two hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 3. Medium turrets,
installed mostly on heavy security vehicles or armored personnel
carriers, take up three hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 6.
Large turrets, which are found on light tanks or heavy gunships, take up four hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 8.
Extra-large turrets belong almost exclusively to heavy main battle
tanks, take up six hardpoints and have a Weapon Value of 10.
However, standard rigger characters do not have access to such
turrets and vehicles.
The weapon values of all weapons mounted on a turret
may not exceed the turret's weapon value, per the Weapon
Values Table.
All turrets have a 360-degree firing arc, with -10 degrees
depression and 45 degrees elevation. Some turrets also have
additional internal space that can accommodate ammunition bins,
smoke launchers, sensor systems, electronics packages and the
like. Mini turrets provide 1 CF of additional space, small turrets 2
CF, and medium turrets 4 CF and internal seating for two.
When firing turret-mounted weapons, reduce recoil modifiers by half before applying recoil compensation from any accessories. Consequently, turrets cancel the double-recoil modifier for
heavy weapons. Turrets are manually operated by a turret gunner.
Anti-Aircraft Turrets
Anti-aircraft capable turrets can elevate to a maximum angle
of 75 degrees, which allows weapons on them to fire at aircraft at
* height lower than 95 percent of the weapon's long-range value.
Multiply the design or parts cost for such turrets by 1.5 and
increase the standard CF Consumed by 1 CF. The turret's Load
Reduction remains the same.
Pop-Up Turrets
Pop-up turrets remain concealed from plain view until their
weapons are used. While they are concealed, the standard -1 penalty to the vehicle's Signature does not apply. To "pop up" this kind of

Remote Turrets
Remote turrets are weapons-only
mounts that the operator controls from
inside the passenger compartment via
remote sensors. A separate gunner or a rigger may operate a remote turret (military
vehicles often use two riggers, one controlling the vehicle and the other controlling the
turret).
Remote turrets are available in micro,
mini, small and medium sizes. Micro turrets,
normally installed on smaller drones, take up
* firmpoint and have a Weapon Value of 1.
Both anti-aircraft capability and pop-up options are available
for remote turrets. Pop-up micro-turrets have a Weapon Value of
* and take up 1 CF.
Large and extra-large remote turrets exist, but they are used
only on large warships, such as destroyers and cruisers, which are
out of the price range of most shadowrunners.

Vehicle Gyroscopic Stabilizers
Vehicle gyroscopic stabilizers are available for weapons
mounted in fixed mounts and turrets. As with normal weapon
gyros, every point of vehicle gyro-stabilization reduces the combined modifiers for recoil and movement (the latter applies only
to vehicles moving by means of mechanical legs).
There is, however, a drawback to gyro-stabilization. The rotational momentum generated by a gyroscope tends to interfere
with the maneuverability of a vehicle. If the total active gyroscopic stabilization rating is greater than the vehicle's Body, the vehicle receives a +1 modifier to its Handling for every point of gyrostabilization greater than the vehicle's Body.
Vehicle gyro-stabilization is not compatible with gunnery
recoil adjusters.

drones to execute even more complex and sophisticated tactics
to accomplish their assigned tasks.
The IVIS receiver module allows a remote-controlled vehicle
or drone to participate in the IVIS system. BattleTac IVIS can provide extra dice for the Comprehension Test or it can create an IVIS
Pool for vehicles or drones to use. Only remotely controlled vehicles or drones that have their Pilots modified to interact with
BattleTac IVIS receive the benefits of this system.

Electronic Countermeasures (ECM)
Electronic countermeasures include active devices such as
barrage radio jammers, infrared jammers, chaff and flare dispensers, and wave harmonic disrupters that confound sensor systems and jam the communications of opposing remote control
operations. See ECM (p. 31) for more information.
Though normally restricted to security and military agencies,
several low-level ECM systems are available on the public market.
These are sold primarily to celebrities and VIPs as a defense
against prying eyes armed with intrusive drones and sensors.

ECCM systems are generally more readily available than
ECM, because ECCM helps to counter the interference caused by
the increasing congestion of the radio spectrum in most metropolitan areas. Higher-level ECCM systems are available only
through licensed security firms or military organizations.

Electronic Deception (ED)
Electronic deception measures are devices that feed sensors
false information about the target's range, position, direction of
travel and so on. Electronic deception is more subtle and insidious than ECM; a sensor won't know it's being deceived until the
metahuman controller physically sees the target with his own
eyes or video feeds. For more information on the use of electronic deception, see Electronic Deception (p. 32).
ED systems are generally restricted to security and military
agencies and are almost impossible to come by on the streets.

Aircraft Drop Tanks
Drop tanks may be attached under an aircraft's wings or fuselage in lieu of rocket/missile mounts. For every two external
mounts sacrificed, a pair of drop tanks may be added. (Drop tanks
are installed in pairs to maintain aerodynamic balance.)
Each drop tank can hold 1,000 liters of fuel, so a pair of drop
tanks increases an aircraft's fuel supply by 2,000 liters. Installing
drop tanks on an aircraft decreases its Signature by 1. Each additional pair of drop tanks decreases the aircraft's Speed by 15, and
every two pairs of drop tanks increases the vehicle's Handling by
1. Mounting drop tanks on an aircraft takes ten minutes.
The pilot may jettison drop tanks if he spends a Complex
Action for that purpose. The aircraft's flight characteristics immediately return to their standard values. The cost of a pair of drop
tanks is 8,000¥. Drop tanks have a Body of 1 and 3 Armor Points.
Amphibious Operation Packages
Amphibious-operation packages are used to modify ground
vehicles for amphibious operations. If the vehicle has watertight
seals and life support, it can be used for underwater operations.
Three types of amphibious-operation packages are available:
Level 1. Level 2 and Level 3.

The Level 1 package uses the vehicle's wheels as the source
of motive power and enables a vehicle to travel through water at
* speed of 15 meters per turn. While operating in this manner, the
vehicle receives a +2 Handling modifier.
Note that surface operations may be performed by vehicles
with unsealed engines. To perform submarine operations, however, a vehicle must have a sealed power plant.

Anti-Theft Systems
Anti-theft systems come in all shapes and sizes and are rated
from 1 to 10. The system rating represents the number of dice
rolled in opposed tests made against intruders. The intruder uses
an appropriate skill (normally the Electronics (Maglocks)
Concentration) in the test.
If the intruder wins, he overrides the anti-theft system and
can enter and hot-wire the vehicle for operation. If the system
wins, the appropriate anti-theft action occurs, depending on what
the designer installed. Some common anti-theft actions are listed
below. The gamemaster and players should work together to
define the exact parameters of the system.
Automated Call: The vehicle makes an automatic call to Lone
Star, the PANICBUTTON system or a similar security service. The
vehicle must be equipped with a portable phone installed in an
electronics port.
Electric Shock: An electrical current ripples through the
outer shell of the vehicle, giving a nasty shock to the would-be
thief. The voltage level (and appropriate damage) varies, depending on the whim of the driver. As a general rule, a standard shock
system does the same damage as a Defiance Super Shock taser
(10S Stun). Lethal shocks (doing physical damage) are possible,
though they are illegal in most countries (not as if that's stopped
shadowrunners in the past, though).
* standard shock system costs an additional 2,000 nuyen, or
20 Design Points. Gamemasters are free to raise the price even
higher for an anti-theft system that gives lethal electric shocks.
Explosion: Characters who really hate vehicle thieves can set
up their anti-theft systems to blow up the vehicle with plastic
explosives (either Compound IV or Compound XII). As a general
rule, vehicles must be packed with enough plastic explosives to
deliver a Power equal to the square of their Body Ratings (see p.
242, SRII, for computing Power for plastic explosives). The explosion destroys the vehicle and inflicts explosive damage on the
would-be intruder-as well as on passengers, cargo and anyone
passing by.
For damage to the vehicle's passengers, cargo, and
bystanders in the immediate vicinity, reduce the damage Power
Level by the Vehicle's Body or Armor Rating, whichever is higher.
For a more powerful effect, the player installing the system can
make a Demolitions (4) Test during installation. If the test succeeds, reduce by half the Body or Armor Rating for this calculation. In any case, the damage Power Level drops by 1 for each
meter of distance from the vehicle.
"Nine-Fingers" Ned is trying to break into a
Mitsubishi Nightsky protected by an anti-theft system.
Unfortunately, he botches the attempt (how do you think
he got the tag "Nine-Fingers"?) and triggers the limousine's alarm system. The system detonates a charge of
Compound IV.
The Nightsky has a Body Rating 4, so the blast must
have a minimum Power equal to 42, or 16, to destroy
the vehicle (along with the would-be thief).
Unfortunately for Ned, the limousine's been packed with
* kilograms of Compound IV, which gives it a Power
Level of 18. (See the plastic explosive rules, p. 242 of
SRII, to determine the Power Level of plastic explosives.)
The Power Level is reduced by the vehicle's Body or
Armor, whichever is higher. In this case, that happens to
be the Nightsky's Body, so the explosion does 14D damage (18 - 4 = 14).
Predictably, Ned fails to resist the damage and gets
his brains splattered against a nearby wall (thus saving
the Nightsky's oyabun owner the trouble of doing the
job himself).
If the vehicle is packed with less than the minimum charge
required to destroy it, the explosion merely damages the vehicle.
If more than half but less than the full minimum is used, the blast
causes Serious Damage. If less than half is used, the blast causes
Moderate Damage. In either case, the explosion causes damage
to passengers, cargo and bystanders.

TANO CUSTOMIZATION
Bench Seats
Bench seats are popular in compact vehicles or other vehicles
in which space is at a premium. A single bench seat can accommodate one and a half human-sized passengers, or 225 kilograms. Two bench seats side by side can hold three passengers,
or 450 kilograms.
Removing a bench seat frees up 6 CF and increases the Load
Rating by 150 kilograms (the seat doesn't weigh 150 kilograms, but
the Load increase reflects the fact that the vehicle now carries fewer
passengers and thus has more power free for hauling cargo).
Bench seats may also be armored (see Bucket Seats), but
such armor protects against attacks from the rear only. Each point
of Armor costs 1,250 nuyen (during customization) or 12 Design
Points (in addition to the cost of the seats) when designing the
vehicle. Up to 2 points of Armor may be installed on a bench seat.
Bench seats are not available for motorcycles.
If an oversized metahuman attempts to sit in a standard seat,
he will crush the seat and mangle its padding. During vehicle
combat, that metahuman must resist 4L damage each turn.
Additionally, he gains a +2 modifier when making Resistance
Tests against collision damage (see Colliding with Objects, p.
52). Metahumans may use reinforced bench seats without penalty (see Reinforced Bench Seats, below).
Folding Bench Seats
Folding bench seats are common in vehicles such as limousines, to provide extra seating for lackeys and the like when needed, or in station wagons. Four CF are freed up for cargo (weighing
up to 150 kilograms) when a folding bench seat is folded.
Reinforced Bench Seats
Reinforced bench seats are designed to support the weight of
trolls and other large metahumans. A reinforced bench seat can
hold up to 300 kilograms.
When replacing a standard bench seat with a reinforced one,
the vehicle's current Load Rating must be able to accommodate
the additional weight of the reinforced seat.
Bucket Seats
* bucket seat holds a single person in greater comfort than a
standard bench seat. Removing a bucket seat frees up 6 CF and
increases a vehicle's Load Rating by 100 kg (the seat doesn't
weigh 100 kilograms, but the Load increase reflects the fact that
the vehicle now carries one less 100-kilogram passenger).
Bucket seats may be armored to provide, protection from
weapons fire. Each point of armor acts as ballistic or impact
armor against any rear or side attacks directed against the passenger while he is in the vehicle. Each point of armor costs
1,250 nuyen or 12 additional Design Points. Up to 2 points of
armor may be installed.
If an oversized metahuman attempts to sit in a standard seat,
he will crush the seat and mangle its padding. During vehicle
combat, that metahuman must resist 4L damage each turn.
Additionally, he gains a +2 modifier when making Resistance
Tests against collision damage (see Colliding with Objects, p.
52). Metahumans may use reinforced bucket seats without penalty (see Reinforced Bucket Seats, below).
Reinforced Bucket Seats
Reinforced bucket seats are designed to support the weight
of large orks, trolls and other large metahumans. A reinforced
bucket seat can hold up to 250 kilograms. Sturdier seats are also
available, but they cost an additional 100 nuyen for every additional 25 kilograms of support capacity.
When replacing a standard bucket seat with a reinforced one,
the vehicle's current Load Rating must be able to accommodate
the additional weight of the reinforced seat.
Ejection Bucket Seats
The ejection bucket seat is a standard or armored bucket
seat fitted with a small solid-fuel rocket and rudimentary stabilization systems. Ejection-activation controls may be included on
or near the seat (or elsewhere) at the time of installation. The seat
includes a para-sail that deploys on ejection and brings the chair
and occupant safely to the ground, assuming the occupant is
securely strapped in. The cost of the seat and the CF Consumed
include the necessary jettison-capable panels that allow the seat
to be fired clear.
Reinforced ejection bucket seats are also available for large
orks, trolls and other large metahumans. Double the appropriate
costs for reinforced ejection seats.

Existing Vehicles Adjusted for Metahumans
All of the vehicles listed in the Vehicle List (p. 148) are also
available in metahuman-adjusted variants, which replace all standard seats with reinforced seating. To calculate the cost of a reinforced-seat model, count the number of bench and bucket seats
in the vehicle. Multiply the number of seats by 1,200 nuyen and
add this amount to the cost of the vehicle. (Yes, this gives a higher cost than simply replacing the regular seats with the reinforced
seats. But remember that the manufacturer is also adjusting the
performance of the vehicle to compensate for the heavier-thannormal driver and passengers.)

Cranes
* crane is a hydraulic-powered mechanical boom capable of
lifting heavy loads. To use a crane, the vehicle must be stationary
and immobilized with the supplied chocks. Cranes are not available for vehicles with Body Ratings of O.
* crane has its own Load Rating, which denotes how many
kilograms of weight it can lift. The maximum Load Rating for a
crane is based on the vehicle's Body, as shown on the Crane
Capacity Table. If desired, players can install cranes with Load
Ratings lower than the maximum allowed for the vehicle.
If a vehicle uses its crane to pull or tow an object while moving (for example, a tow truck towing an automobile), the towing
maximum is determined by the vehicle's or crane's Load Rating,
whichever is lower.
For more information on lifting and towing, see Lifting and

Drone Racks
Drone racks are used to launch airborne drones from moving

Launching a drone from a drone rack requires two separate
actions, the first to activate the drone rack and the second to
launch the drone. The drone is then considered to be moving at
either the current speed of the vehicle or the drone's stall speed,
whichever is greater. Rotorcraft drones launched from stationary
vehicles launch in hover mode.
Recovering a launched drone requires a successful Handling
Test by the driver of the recovering vehicle and a Free Action. At
the same time, the drone's controller must make a Handling Test.
If either test fails, the drone has not been recovered. If both tests
fail, the drone crashes into the vehicle.
The drone rack also serves as an enclosed mini-hangar that
protects drones stored inside it. A drone rack has the same Armor
Rating as the vehicle on which it is mounted, but only one-half the
vehicle's Body (round down.)

Floatation Packages (Aircraft)
Any aircraft or helicopter may be fitted with floats for
amphibious operations. Adding floats to an aircraft increases the

Additionally, the floats reduce the aircraft's Speed by half. And of
course, an aircraft fitted with floats cannot touch down on land.
Floats also reduce the Speed Ratings of helicopters. To determine the reduced Speed of a float-equipped helicopter, multiply
the helicopter's initial Speed Rating by .9 and round down. The
product is the helicopter's new Speed Rating. Float-equipped
helicopters can still touch down on land, however.

Mechanical Arms
Articulated mechanical arms are not as strong as cranes, but
they possess superior dexterity. In fact, a mechanical arm can do
the same things a metahuman arm can and then some.
Every mechanical arm has a Strength Rating, which is equal
to the vehicle's Body Rating squared. (For example, an arm fitted
to a vehicle with a Body Rating 1 would have a starting Strength
of 1, an arm on a Body 2 vehicle would have a starting Strength
of 4, an arm on a Body 3 vehicle would have a starting Strength
of 9 and so on.) A mechanical arm can lift a number of kilograms
equal to its Strength Rating multiplied by 50.
An arm's Strength Rating may be increased by purchasing
additional Strength enhancement. Note that increasing the
Strength of an arm also increases its Load reduction, which limits
the amount of Strength enhancement a mechanical arm can take.
The Strength Rating of a limb can never increase beyond ten times
the Body Rating of the vehicle to which it is attached.
Mechanical arms can sport any accessory or feature available
on cyberarms except for the limb enhancements described in the Cybertechnology
sourcebook. A limb accessory for a
mechanical arm costs half as much as the
standard cyberarm version of the accessory, but has the same Availability and Street

Sidecars
Motorcycle sidecars come in three sizes: small, medium and
large. The Sidecar Table shows the costs and benefits of adding a
sidecar to a vehicle.
The cargo capacity for each sidecar does not include seating,
which must be taken out of the sidecar's CF capacity (for example,
* small sidecar can accommodate one bucket seat, but it takes up
all of the sidecar's CF). A motorcycle's Load Rating does not
change with the installation of a sidecar, so characters will have to
be careful not to overload the sidecar with excessive weight.
* sidecar reduces the cycle's Speed by 15, increases its
Handling Rating by the appropriate modifier and decreases its
Economy by 10 percent. (To calculate the new Economy, simply
multiply the initial Economy Rating by .9.) A sidecar has the same
Body Rating as the vehicle on which it is mounted. Sidecar armor
may be increased in accordance with the standard vehicle modification rules (p. 127).
Installing or removing a sidecar requires 15 minutes.
Spotlights
* spotlight projects a concentrated beam of light. It has an
effective range of 600 meters, with a beam diameter of 0.5 meters
at the point of origin and 5 meters at maximum range. The beam
diameter increases in proportion to the range, so the diameter of
the spotlight at 300 meters would be 300/600 x (0.5 + 5), or 2.75
meters.
In addition to standard white-light spotlights, spotlights are

Tires
* number of different tire types are available. All require a
standard tool kit to install. Spare tires take up a number of CF
equal to one-half the Body of the vehicle, rounded down.
All vehicles are fitted with appropriate tires at the time of
manufacture for no extra cost. Characters need only pay tire costs
if they request special tires during vehicle design or replace or
add tires as vehicle customizations.
Standard tires are regular, run-of-the-mill tires. For vehicles
using these tires, reduce by half (round down) the effects of any
suspension or Handling modifications. Cost = Body x 50¥ each.
Performance tires are required for use with improved suspension and drive-by-wire systems. They also negate the effects
of off-road or active suspensions in off-road mode. Cost = Body x
75¥ each.
Off-road tires are required for use with off-road suspensions
or active suspensions in off-road mode. With all other types of
suspensions, they behave as standard tires (i.e., they negate the
benefits of improved suspension and drive-by-wire improvements during on-road operation). Cost = Body x 125¥ each.
Dual-Purpose tires are designed for use with active suspensions, allowing vehicles to operate both off-road and on-road
without penalty. These tires act like standard tires with regard to
improved and high-speed suspensions. Assume that any vehicle
with improved suspension or a drive-by-wire system is also
equipped with dual-purpose tires. Cost = Body x 250¥ each.
Runflat versions of all the aforementioned tire types are
available. A runflat tire has the equivalent protection of an
armored vest (5/3). Cost = tire cost + 200¥ each.
Winches
Winches are attached to the bumpers of ground vehicles and
can pull and tow heavy loads.
* winch has its own Load Rating/weight capacity, which
determines how much weight the winch can pull, tow or lift. The
maximum Load Rating for a winch is based on the vehicle's Body,
as shown on the Winch Capacity Table. If desired, players can
select winches with Load Ratings lower than the maximum for
their vehicle's Body Ratings.
If a vehicle uses its winch to pull or tow an object while moving (for example, a tow truck towing an automobile), the towing
maximum is determined by the vehicle's or winch's Load Rating,
whichever is lower.
* vehicle can also use a winch to pull itself across normally
impassable terrain, such as up a vertical cliff face. The vehicle must
not be loaded over its Load Rating when doing so, however. The
winch pulls the vehicle at a speed of 1 meter per turn. The vehicle cannot perform any other actions while the winch is working.

GAMEMASTER APPROVAL OF VEHICLES
The revised vehicle design and customization rules were
designed to provide players with as much flexibility as possible
when creating vehicles. This flexibility gives players enormous
freedom to exercise their imaginations, but it also enables them
to misuse the system. To prevent such misuse, the gamemaster
has the right to approve, modify or disallow any new vehicle.
Ideally, vehicle design should be a cooperative process
between the player and the gamemaster, with a little give-andtake on both sides. If a player has a really creative, solid and wellWINCH CAPACITY TABLE

thought-out idea, the gamemaster should respect the player's
efforts and let him run with it. At the same time, the gamemaster
also has the responsibility to keep the game balanced, entertaining and challenging-and players should respect that.
If a player creates a vehicle that threatens the balance of the
game or gives an unfair advantage (either to the player character
or the NPCs), the gamemaster has several options. For example,
the gamemaster has the final say over the final vehicle cost, so by
sufficiently raising the cost he can limit the vehicle's use in the
game. Alternatively, the gamemaster can change any of the vehicle's ratings, features, design options and modifications, or even
veto proposed design options and vehicle modifications. And as
* last resort, the gamemaster can simply prohibit the player from
introducing the vehicle into the game.
CONVERTING EXISTING VEHICLES
The Rigger II sourcebook is a complete overhaul of the entire
vehicle system. It changes the elementary definitions of several
vehicle ratings, deletes a few old ratings and introduces several
new ratings. Consequently, no simple method exists for translating the game statistics of previously published or player-designed
vehicles to the new system.
The Vehicle List (p. 148) provides new game statistics for all
vehicles published in previous FASA products. The new statistics
re-create the original vehicles as faithfully as possible: they were
retrofitted to account for Design Points and Mark-Up Factors, but
the final vehicle prices may not precisely reflect a new vehicle
built using this system. The final vehicle prices for existing vehicles are, however, balanced in the game and balanced against the
prices of new vehicles built using the Vehicle Design and
Customization system. Gamemasters may adjust these prices up
or down to suit their own game, but the prices given here should
be considered the official costs of these vehicles.
As far as player-designed vehicles and "home-brew" inventions
are concerned, we recommend that players re-design these vehicles
using the vehicle-design rules in this section. When re-designing
vehicles, players should keep the following principles in mind.
First, Body Ratings are fixed and cannot be changed, either during vehicle design or vehicle customization. A vehicle's Body Rating
is linked to the vehicle's weight, and the rating system uses a scale
of 1 to 10 to cover vehicles ranging in size from a toaster-sized
drone to a sixty-ton main battle tank. Therefore, Body Ratings of
vehicles of the same type should never differ significantly.
Second, remember that Design Points are used to purchase
design options and modifications during the vehicle design
process. Once the character has purchased the vehicle (either during character creation or later in the adventure), additional modifications must be made as vehicle customizations and paid for
with nuyen. not Design Points. Also, the specifications of a modification may differ depending on whether the modification is
incorporated during vehicle design or installed later as a vehicle
customization. These specifications are noted in the descriptions
of each modification.
The final price of a vehicle is determined by multiplying the
Design Points by the Mark-Up Factor. Gamemasters are free to
"fudge" the Mark-Up Factor in either direction, in the interest of
adding variety to their games and preventing their campaigns
from degenerating into vehicle "powergaming."
