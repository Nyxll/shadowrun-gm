# Debug Telemetry System - COMPLETE ✅

## Overview
Comprehensive real-time telemetry system implemented for the Shadowrun GM game server, providing complete visibility into all system operations with color-coded events, filtering, search, and export capabilities.

## 🎉 Implementation Complete

### Phase 1: Server-Side Telemetry ✅
**File: `game-server.py`**

#### 6 Telemetry Helper Functions Added:
1. **`send_telemetry()`** - Base telemetry with INFO/WARNING/ERROR/DEBUG levels
2. **`send_mcp_telemetry()`** - MCP operation tracking (start/complete phases)
3. **`send_database_telemetry()`** - SQL query tracking with timing
4. **`send_api_telemetry()`** - HTTP endpoint tracking
5. **`send_error_telemetry()`** - Full error context with stack traces
6. **`send_ui_telemetry()`** - UI interaction tracking

#### WebSocket Handler Enhanced:
- ✅ Tool execution tracking with `send_mcp_telemetry()`
- ✅ Error handling with `send_error_telemetry()`
- ✅ UI events (character add/remove) with `send_ui_telemetry()`
- ✅ Performance timing for all operations
- ✅ Success/failure status tracking

### Phase 3: Client-Side UI ✅
**File: `www/app.js`**

#### Enhanced Telemetry Display:
- ✅ **20+ Event Types** with unique color coding
- ✅ **Event Level Badges** (ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
- ✅ **Component Labels** (WebSocket, Grok AI, MCP, Database, API, UI, System)
- ✅ **Filtering System** (all, errors, warnings, info)
- ✅ **Search Functionality** (real-time event search)
- ✅ **Auto-Scroll Toggle** (enable/disable auto-scroll)
- ✅ **Export Logs** (download telemetry as JSON)
- ✅ **Event Details Modal** (click any event for full details)
- ✅ **Memory Management** (keeps last 500 events)

## 🎨 UI Features

### Event Display
```javascript
// Each event shows:
- Timestamp (HH:MM:SS)
- Event name (color-coded)
- Level badge (ERROR/WARNING/INFO/DEBUG)
- Component label [WebSocket/Grok AI/MCP/etc]
- Key data (operation, duration, success, etc.)
```

### Filtering
```javascript
// Filter by level:
filterTelemetryEvents('all')      // Show all events
filterTelemetryEvents('errors')   // Show only errors
filterTelemetryEvents('warnings') // Show only warnings
filterTelemetryEvents('info')     // Show only info
```

### Search
```javascript
// Real-time search across all event data:
searchTelemetryEvents('get_character')  // Find character operations
searchTelemetryEvents('error')          // Find all errors
searchTelemetryEvents('Platinum')       // Find events mentioning Platinum
```

### Export
```javascript
// Export all telemetry to JSON file:
exportTelemetryLogs()
// Creates: shadowrun-telemetry-{timestamp}.json
```

### Event Details
```javascript
// Click any event to see full details in modal:
showEventDetails(index)
// Shows: timestamp, level, component, full data JSON
```

## 📈 Telemetry Data Format

```json
{
  "type": "telemetry",
  "event": "mcp_operation_complete",
  "level": "INFO",
  "data": {
    "operation": "get_character",
    "duration_ms": 125.45,
    "success": true,
    "payload_reduction": "52.3%"
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-30T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

# MCP Operation Tracking
await send_mcp_telemetry(websocket, "get_character", "start", {
    "arguments": {"character_name": "Platinum"}
})

# ... perform operation ...

await send_mcp_telemetry(websocket, "get_character", "complete", {
    "duration_ms": 125.45,
    "success": True,
    "payload_reduction": "52.3%"
})

# Error Tracking
try:
    result = await some_operation()
except Exception as e:
    await send_error_telemetry(websocket, e, "Operation context")
    raise

# UI Event Tracking
await send_ui_telemetry(websocket, "character_selected", "character-list", {
    "character": "Platinum",
    "total_characters": 3
})
```

### Client-Side (www/app.js)

// Events are automatically logged when received
// User can:
// - Filter by level (all/errors/warnings/info)
// - Search for specific events
// - Click events for details
// - Export logs to JSON
// - Toggle auto-scroll
```
