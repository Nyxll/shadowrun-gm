# Schema Reality Check

## The Problem
The `schema.sql` file (v3.0) represents a SIMPLIFIED/FUTURE schema, but the ACTUAL database is running a much more complex schema with:
- 99 total tables (not ~10)
- Full audit trail support on many tables
- Separate tables for spells, spirits, foci, contacts, vehicles, etc.
- JSONB fields for flexible data storage

## What I Got Wrong in CRUD Fixes

### ❌ character_vehicles
- **My change**: Removed audit fields
- **Reality**: Table HAS audit fields (created_by, modified_by, deleted_at, deleted_by)
- **Fix needed**: RESTORE audit field support in CRUD operations
- **Sensor data**: Should go in `modifications` JSONB field, not a separate column

### ❌ character_modifiers  
- **My change**: Kept audit fields (CORRECT)
- **Reality**: Table HAS full audit support
- **Status**: ✅ This was correct

### ✅ character_edges_flaws
- **My change**: Removed `cost` field
- **Reality**: Table has NO cost field
- **Status**: ✅ This was correct

### ✅ character_skills
- **My change**: Use base_rating + current_rating
- **Reality**: Table has both fields
- **Status**: ✅ This was correct

### ❌ character_spirits, character_foci, character_contacts
- **My change**: Removed audit fields
- **Reality**: Tables have NO audit fields
- **Status**: ✅ This was correct

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Work with Actual Schema (RECOMMENDED)
- Update schema.sql to match actual database
- Fix CRUD to match actual schema
- Keep all existing functionality
- **Pros**: Works with what exists, no data migration
- **Cons**: More complex schema to maintain

### Option 2: Migrate to Simplified Schema
- Apply schema.sql v3.0 to database
- Migrate all data to new structure
- Update all code to match
- **Pros**: Cleaner, simpler schema
- **Cons**: Risky migration, potential data loss, lots of work

## Immediate Actions Needed

1. ✅ Export actual schema (DONE - schema-actual.sql)
2. ⏳ Update schema.sql with actual schema
3. ⏳ Fix character_vehicles CRUD (restore audit fields)
4. ⏳ Document sensor data goes in modifications JSONB
5. ⏳ Verify all other CRUD operations match actual schema
6. ⏳ Update MCP operations
7. ⏳ Update orchestrator
8. ⏳ Update UI

## Decision Point
**User needs to decide**: Work with actual schema OR migrate to simplified schema?
