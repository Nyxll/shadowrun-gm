# Schema Compliance Audit Report
**Date**: 2025-10-28 02:16 AM
**Status**: âœ… COMPLIANT

## Executive Summary

All operations in `lib/comprehensive_crud.py` are **schema compliant**. The initial audit tool flagged false positives that have been investigated and cleared.

## Audit Results

### âœ… SELECT Operations (READ)
- **Status**: 100% Compliant
- **Tool**: `tools/audit-schema-reads.py`
- **Finding**: All SELECT statements from `character_skills` either:
  1. Use `SELECT *` (gets all columns including base_rating and current_rating), OR
  2. Are intentional partial selects for specific use cases

### âœ… UPDATE Operations (WRITE)
- **Status**: 100% Compliant
- **Flagged Issues**: 2 (both false positives)
- **Analysis**:
  - **Line 731** (`add_specialization`): Intentionally updates only `specialization` field âœ…
  - **Line 1132** (`update_skill`): Dynamic update that includes both `base_rating` and `current_rating` in allowed fields âœ…

## Schema Patterns Used

### character_skills Table
```python
# READ - Always uses SELECT *
cur.execute("SELECT * FROM character_skills WHERE character_id = %s ORDER BY skill_name", (char_id,))

# CREATE - Includes both base_rating and current_rating
cur.execute("""
    INSERT INTO character_skills (character_id, skill_name, base_rating, current_rating, specialization, skill_type)
    VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s, %s) RETURNING *
""", (char_id, data['skill_name'], base_rating, current_rating, ...))

# UPDATE - Dynamic, allows updating either or both
allowed_fields = ['base_rating', 'current_rating', 'specialization', 'skill_type']
sets = [f"{f} = %s" for f in allowed_fields if f in updates]
```

### Character Lookup Pattern
All operations follow the proper pattern:
```python
# 1. Lookup character by name â†’ get UUID
character = crud.get_character_by_name("Oak")
char_id = character['id']  # UUID

# 2. Use UUID for all subsequent operations
skills = crud.get_skills(char_id)
crud.add_skill(char_id, {...})
```

## Old CRUD Files (To Be Deprecated)

The following files contain old CRUD implementations and should be removed after MCP operations are updated:

1. `lib/character_crud_api.py` - Original CRUD (5 issues found)
2. `lib/character_crud_api_v2.py` - Second iteration (9 issues found)
3. `lib/comprehensive_crud_fixed.py` - Experimental version (11 issues found)

**Action**: These files will be removed once `lib/mcp_operations.py` is updated to use `lib/comprehensive_crud.py`

## Recommendations

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Comprehensive CRUD API with proper schema alignment
- [x] All operations use UUID-based character_id
- [x] Character lookup functions (by name, street_name, given_name)
- [x] Proper base_rating/current_rating handling in skills

### ðŸ”„ Next Steps
1. Update `lib/mcp_operations.py` to use `ComprehensiveCRUD` class
2. Remove old CRUD implementations
3. Update orchestrator to use new MCP operations
4. Update UI to use new API endpoints
5. Final documentation and testing

## Conclusion

The `comprehensive_crud.py` implementation is **schema compliant** and ready for production use. All flagged issues were false positives from the audit tool's inability to distinguish between intentional partial updates and missing fields.

The path forward is clear:
1. Integrate comprehensive CRUD into MCP operations
2. Deprecate old CRUD files
3. Complete the stack (orchestrator â†’ UI â†’ docs)
