## Overview
Comprehensive telemetry system implemented for the Shadowrun GM game server to provide complete visibility into all system operations in real-time.

## ‚úÖ Completed Work

### 1. Design & Planning
**Files Created:**

   - Includes arguments, results, timing data
   - Automatic success/failure detection

3. **`send_database_telemetry()`** - Database operation tracking
   - Tracks SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE queries
   - Includes table name and query duration
   - Performance monitoring ready

4. **`send_api_telemetry()`** - API endpoint tracking

### 3. WebSocket Handler Integration
**Enhanced telemetry in WebSocket endpoint:**

‚úÖ **Tool Execution Tracking**

- Includes full stack traces
- Provides context about failed operations

### 4. Event Types Supported

**WebSocket Events:**
- `websocket_connected` - Connection established

**MCP Operation Events:**
- `mcp_operation_start` - Operation initiated
- `mcp_operation_complete` - Operation finished (success/failure)

**Database Events:**
- `database_query` - SQL query executed (with timing)

**API Events:**
- `api_request` - HTTP request received
- `api_response` - HTTP response sent

**UI Events:**

- `character_removed` - Character removed from session

**System Events:**
- `request_complete` - Full request cycle complete
- `error_occurred` - Error with full context
