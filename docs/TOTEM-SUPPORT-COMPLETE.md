# Totem Support Implementation - COMPLETE

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Phase 11.1.2 of the spellcasting system is now complete with full totem modifier support.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 015)
- ✅ Created `totems` reference table with all 55 SR2 totems
- ✅ Added `totem` column to `characters` table
- ✅ Each totem includes:
  - `favored_categories` (TEXT[]): Spell categories that get +2 dice
  - `opposed_categories` (TEXT[]): Spell categories that get -2 dice
  - `bonus_dice` (default: 2)
  - `penalty_dice` (default: -2)
  - `spirit_type`, `description`

### 2. Spellcasting Engine Updates
- ✅ Implemented `get_totem_modifier()` method
  - Looks up character's totem
  - Checks if spell class is favored (+2) or opposed (-2)
  - Returns 0 for neutral categories
- ✅ Integrated totem modifiers into drain calculation
  - Favored spells: Drain reduced by 2
  - Opposed spells: Drain increased by 2
  - Applied in `calculate_drain()` method

### 3. Testing
- ✅ Created comprehensive totem modifier tests
- ✅ Tested with "Test Leviathan" character
  - Leviathan totem: Favors Manipulation (+2), Opposes Illusion (-2)
- ✅ All test cases pass:
  - Manipulation: +2 ✓
  - Illusion: -2 ✓
  - Health, Combat, Detection: 0 ✓

## Example Totems

### Oak (Favors Health)
```
Favored: ['Health']
Opposed: None
Bonus: +2 dice for Health spells
```

### Leviathan (Favors Manipulation, Opposes Illusion)
```
Favored: ['Manipulation']
Opposed: ['Illusion']
Bonus: +2 dice for Manipulation spells
Penalty: -2 dice for Illusion spells
```

### Cat (Favors Illusion, Opposes Combat)
```
Favored: ['Illusion']
Opposed: ['Combat']
Bonus: +2 dice for Illusion spells
Penalty: -2 dice for Combat spells
```

## How It Works

1. **Character has totem**: Oak has totem "Oak"
2. **Spell is cast**: Oak casts "Heal" (Health spell) at Force 6
3. **Totem lookup**: System finds Oak totem favors Health (+2)
4. **Drain calculation**: 
   - Base drain: (6/2)M = 3M
   - Totem modifier: -2 (favored)
   - Final drain: 1M (3 - 2 = 1)
5. **Resistance roll**: Roll Willpower vs TN 1

## Files Modified

- `migrations/015_add_totem_support.sql` - Applied
- `lib/spellcasting.py` - Updated with totem logic
- `tests/test-spellcasting-totem.py` - New comprehensive test

## Next Steps

Phase 11.1.3: Spell Effects & Sustained Spells
- Design active_effects tracking table
- Implement sustained spell mechanics
- Add spell effect calculations (armor, attribute mods, etc.)

## Notes

- All 55 SR2 totems are loaded and ready to use
- Totem modifiers apply to DRAIN, not casting success
- This follows SR2 rules exactly
- Test character "Test Leviathan" created for testing opposed categories
