    "content": "Ideally, characters should view magic in the Shadowrun universe as a mysterious, unpredictable force that exposes its users to great risk, as well as providing them with great power. However, as players have grown increasingly familiar with the magic rules over the past few years, characters no longer fear magic's random and unpredictable nature. In addition, some magician characters have amassed enormous powers that disrupt game balance and make the life of their teams much safer—and a lot less fun. The rules in this section are designed to remedy these problems by providing gamemasters with new ways to inject more unpredictability and danger into the use of magic, restrict the power of magician characters, and reduce the total amount of magic in their games.",

    "content": "Those players anxiously awaiting a dramatic, noticeable rise in the magic level of the universe should keep in mind that all Shadowrun magic depends on the level of mana, a natural force that rises and falls in a cycle that lasts thousands of years. Currently, the universe's mana level is simply not high enough to power specialty magic items other than foci. Some day the mana level may rise high enough to power such items and make possible other unimaginable magical feats. Of course, mana is a mysterious and unknown force, so no one can truly predict what course it will take. That said, various Shadowrun books such as Threats, Harlequin's Back and Awakenings contain subtle hints and clues about the ebb and flow of mana, and interested players will find continuing clues to coming changes in future Shadowrun releases.",

All too often, however, magician characters undergo initiation as soon as possible to reap the benefits it provides. In some campaigns, this may be acceptable and even desirable. Generally, however, a rash of 'rampant initiations' can ruin the balance of a game. Gamemasters can restrict initiations in several ways. Most simply, gamemasters can prohibit player characters from using the Force Points from their allocated Resources to create starting-character initiates.",
