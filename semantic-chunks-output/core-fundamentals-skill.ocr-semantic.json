Shadowrun skills are groups of closely related techniques and knowledge, not narrow, limiting areas of function. The game takes this approach in an attempt to keep down the number of statistics. If a character uses **Concentrations** and **Specializations**, he or she has increased capability in that specialized area, but at the cost of reduced ability in the rest of the functions covered by the general skill.",

    "content": "The rules make frequent reference to **Success Tests**. To make a Success Test for a skill, use the numerical rating of the skill named for the test as the number of six-sided dice to roll. Each individual die result that equals or exceeds the specified target number is a **success**. Usually one success is enough to indicate that the character has passed the test.\n\nThere are two kinds of tests. In a **success test**, the character is attempting to accomplish something without any interference. Roll the dice as described above; successes determine the effect of the skill’s use. Often, when one character is attempting to attack another character (or object), the target also makes a standard test and uses his or her successes to offset those the attacker rolled. Exactly how those successes are offset varies with the type of attack.\n\nIn an **opposed test**, two characters use the same skill, or an opposing skill, against one another, with only one of them able to actually succeed in the effort. Usually, the character generating the greater number of successes achieves his goal. Negotiation is a typical situation for this type of test.\n\nUsing the **Skill Success Table** as a guide, the Gamemaster determines the target number necessary for success. The rules usually specify a target number for specific skill uses. Circumstances and conditions (bad weather, stress, and so on) can change the target number.\n\nTests for Attributes are handled in the exact same manner as for skills, where the number of dice rolled is based on the Attribute Rating.\n\n---",

It is not necessary to trace the shortest path. Count the number of circles passed, with each circle increasing the target number by +2.\n\nWhen **defaulting to an Attribute**, go to the desired Attribute’s position on the web and trace a path from it to the listing for the desired skill. Again, each circle passed in tracing the path adds an additional +2 to the target number. (No one ever said it would be easy.)\n\nIt is only possible to trace a path in the direction of the arrows.

If the character is trying to build something new, he or she also needs theoretical knowledge to design the item, unless someone else provides a detailed blueprint for its construction. See Behind the Scenes for details on how to use Build and Repair Skills.\n\nConcentrations for Build/Repair Skills refer to types of equipment when they relate to named skills, and to the category of equipment when they apply to groups of skills. Thus, a Concentration in Armed Combat (B/R) works for Edged Weapons but not for other melee weapons, and a Concentration in Ground Vehicles (B/R) might be Bikes, but not include Car and Hovercraft.\n\nIf a Build/Repair Skill is available, it will be to the general skill, and separated by only one circle on the Skill Web.\n\n---",
