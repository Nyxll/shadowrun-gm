Non-aerodynamic models often offer a \"booby-trap\" setting that detonates by electric signal or pressure release. These models are shaped as spheres or cylinders. Aerodynamic models are rings or disks with superior range capabilities. Explosive grenades come in one of three types. Defensive grenades have the lowest radius of destruction, allowing the character to use the grenade as he presses forward. Offensive grenades have a higher fragmentation effect. Concussion grenades are intended to have little fragmentation effect at all, relying on the blast effect to stun or injure targets. 30¥ per grenade, regardless of type.\n* **Mini-grenades:** Mini-grenades are bullet-like projectiles designed for grenade launchers. They cannot be armed and thrown. Mini-grenades come in offensive, defensive, and concussion forms, delivering the same blast as their larger brothers. Mini-grenades cost 50¥ per grenade, regardless of type.\n* **Plastic Explosives:** Highly stable, moldable, and slightly sticky, these substances are ideal for certain jobs, such as blowing a hole in a wall. Compounds are usually color-tinted to indicate the level of current needed to detonate them, from the black of magnetic-field induction to the chalky white of 440-volt industrial explosive. Commercial (non-plastic) explosives cost 60¥ per kilogram. Compound IV plastic explosives cost 80¥ per kilo, and Compound 12 costs 200¥ per kilo. Timers (2 second to 2 hours) can be purchased for 100¥ each. Radio detonators (one-half kilometer range) cost 250¥. The Damage Code is (Rating)D per kilogram. Use the following formula for multiple kilograms: (Rating × √kilograms)D. The Power of the blast is reduced by the base Rating per meter. See Blast Effects, p. 97.\n\n---",

It can be equipped for direct data transmission, or it can store images for later recovery. **10,000¥**\n* **Spotter Drone:** This winged, stealth aircraft carries equipment similar to that of the surveillance drone. The spotter is designed for longer missions with increased loiter times. Recovery is more difficult, though, because the craft needs a runway or a catch net to avoid a crash on return. **15,000¥**\n* **Hunter:** This is a designation for armed versions of surveillance or spotter drones.
