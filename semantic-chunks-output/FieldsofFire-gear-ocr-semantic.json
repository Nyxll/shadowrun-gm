    "content": "For the times when a standard round doesn't cut it, pick up the Barret Model 121 heavy sniper rifle and its custom, armor-piercing ammo. The heaviest small-arms round available, Barret ammo works against both soft and hard targets. Don't let armor skin slow you down; punch through it and take down your target. The Model 121's integral silencer system combines with blow-back recoil compensation to give it precision balance in spite of its heavy caliber. Silent, deadly, and accurate, the Barret guarantees you one shot and one down.\n\n| Type | Conceal | Ammo | Mode | Damage | Weight | Availability | Cost | Street Index |\n| :----- | ------- | ---- | ---- | ------ | ------ | -----------: | ---: | -----------: |\n| Sniper | 14 (c) | Mode | SA | 14D | 10 | 5 | | |\nThis weapon offers the equivalent of 2 points of Recoil Reduction and has a +2 recoil modifier. It also comes with an integral Smartlink I system. Treat custom ammo as APDS rounds; the ammo costs 200¥ per box of 10, and has the same Availability and Street Index as the weapon. A player must make separate tests to acquire each box.\n\n> (Grade A+ bang-bang! This one's a frightening piece of work. An \"associate\" of mine uses the Model 121 extensively. I've backed her up on a couple of jobs; when she's fired at anything further away than a couple of meters, I've heard no gun noise whatso-ever. Scary.) -Hatchetman (03:20:45/10-05-54)\n> (You can use the Model 121 right out of the box; I had to use it that way once. I've upgraded mine to use Smartlink Il hardware and fire caseless ammo: no casings, no evidence. The Smartlink's rangefinder makes the long shot a breeze. One drawback, though; the weapon doesn't come apart easily. You have to carry it assembled, and the fraggin' thing is almost as long as I am tall.) -Nightmare (12:19:38/10-08-54)\n> (Have you ever seen one of the slugs it fires ?? I use them as paperweights.) -Toad (23:08:25/10-12-54)",

No upgrade can cure that!) -Wylie Eye (23:28:17/12-06-54)\n> (You didn't read the entry very carefully, did you, Wylie? This upgrade lets the Wasp bounce light pistol ammo and absorb the heavier stuff, and the Yellowjacket bounce pretty much everything that classifies as a non-heavy weapon. I'd think twice about playing with these Insects.) -Mooch (10:18:45/12-07-54)\n> (I carry an assault cannon.) -Wylie Eye (19:02:17/12-08-54)\n> (Oh, well, never mind.) -Mooch (11:02:18/12-09-54)",

Spew smoke on demand from an externally mounted canister that can be triggered from inside the vehicle. Huge, dense clouds cover the battlefield in no time!

For smoke rules, see p. 85.\n\n> (Heh-heh. Reminds me of the time I chased down a well equipped rebel force in Nicaragua. One of the Appaloosas we were after decided to blow some smoke. The scout was running at more than 100 KPH trailing this long, thin black line. Sensors or no sensors, we could have found the fools by that smoke.

    "content": "Looking for a little more armor protection for your vehicle? European Arm Works (EAW) has the answer in its new line of modular ablative armor. Designed to attach to the vehicle's exterior, ablative armor absorbs the kinetic energy of any blast. A hit blows the armor plates clear, but they save you from sudden death! Three different available levels let you choose the degree of protection you need! Not usable on aircraft.\n\n| Armor Level | Availability | Cost | Street Index |\n| ----------- | ------------ | ------:| ------------ |\n| 1 | 8/14 days | 700¥ | 2 |\n| 2 | 12/14 days | 1,600¥ | 2 |\n| 3 | 14/21 days | 2,500¥ | 2 |\nAblative armor adds twice its level to a vehicle's effective Armor Rating, to a maximum equal to its Body. When struck by an attack with a Power greater than 3 times the armor level, reduce the increase in the Armor Rating by -1. It takes 6 hours to install ablative armor, which cannot be concealed. Ablative armor is not Hardened.",
