The following rules allow players and gamemasters to create shapeshifter characters and provide guidelines and examples for creating additional metatypes. As always, gamemasters have the final say on whether or not to include these new character types in their games.",

As noted in the preceding section, shapeshifters receive various Attribute bonuses in both animal and human forms. To switch between forms, a shapeshifter must spend a Complex Action. The transformation from human to animal does not include any of the shapeshifter's equipment or clothing; clothing will be ripped and equipment may be damaged during the transformation if the character does not remove it first.\n\nWhen in animal form, a shapeshifter resembles a mundane member of its species; only its astral presence distinguishes it from a mundane animal. A shapeshifter in animal form can communicate with other members of its species, but cannot speak or use Social skills. Shapeshifter magicians in animal form can cast spells, but cannot use Centering skills or fulfill geasa that their beast-forms cannot perform. In animal form a shapechanger cannot use his or her physical adept powers. They are only usable in human form.",
