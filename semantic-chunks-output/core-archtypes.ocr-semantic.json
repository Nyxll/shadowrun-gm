I canceled the rocket team with a twitch of the old trigger muscle and roared my turtle past their sec teams and scrambled the reins before they could hit the main force. Got a nice bonus for that scrap. Good ratings on the first-run circuit, too. Old EBM2 appreciates quality workmanship. Just wanted you to understand what kind of quality you're talking to here.",

We must now take up the mantle again. The shamans understand this. They are wise men.\"\n>\"Years ago, the Great Ghost Dance promised our fathers salvation. It was so, but not as our fathers foresaw it. The Great Spirit has a deeper plan. He has given us much to aid us in our work. We must provide the rest. We will only see the land prosper if we work to aid it. The old ways are forever gone, but that is not bad. There are new ways now, but that too is not bad. We walk a path between the old and the new; a path of our own choosing, one that will lead us to greatness and the fulfillment of our dreams as long as we do not neglect or forsake the land.\"\n>\"I walk now in the shadows of the towers of steel and glass rather than the shadow of the trees. It is a stalker's path, sometimes a warrior's path. Always I strive to make it a path of honor and wisdom.\"\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe tribesman is a member of one of the local tribes, possibly metahuman, scattered throughout the wilderness.
