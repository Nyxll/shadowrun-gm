When the system is operating, any piece of data known to one member of the \"battle network\" is known to all. For example, if one soldier sees an advancing enemy unit, all others in the \"network\" instantly know that force's composition, direction, heading, and speed. Other members in the network can use this data as spotting information and call for indirect fire against that target, or maneuver to intercept or ambush those forces. Because all members of the BattleTac™ unit see all information simultaneously, the unit can move like a wellprogrammed machine and react quickly to changing battlefield conditions. The BattleTac™ system works in a manner similar to the telecommunication system described on p. xx. Use the ratings given for that system to represent signal security and encryption efficiency.

The attacking character must also modify the target number by one-half the cover modifier.

Gamemasters may need to determine the amount of cover protecting a target, especially when that cover is environmental and coincidental (characters fighting in the woods, an amusement park, and so on). The gamemaster should base the modifier on how much of the target is visible, using the Partial Cover Table below as a guideline.\nThe gamemaster should judge how much of the target can be seen in terms of an overall area.

Multiple rounds may be targeted at a single 1-meter area to increase the effectiveness of the covering/suppression fire. If the attack covers multiple areas, these areas must be directly adjacent to another covered area. If, during the time that the area is covered, a character enters that area, moves, and thereby exposes himself to the covering/suppression fire, or presents his body to fire within that area in any manner, he might be hit. If line of sight can be drawn from the attacker to any part of the target during the time the area is covered, the target is potentially vulnerable. To determine if the covering/suppression fire strikes the target character, resolve a Ranged Attack against the target by rolling a number of dice equal to the number of rounds fired at the area. The Target Number equals a base of 4 modified only by Cover and any Damage Modifier the attacker must add. Every 2 successes generated results in 1 round striking the target, up to a maximum of the number of rounds fired into the area.",

    "title": "INSTANT DEATH AND OVER-DAMAGE",
    "content": "As written, the SRII rules make it effectively impossible to kill an unwounded character with a single attack. In fact, an unwounded character can technically survive a nuclear blast at ground zero, because the nuke only does \"D\" damage with no Body Overflow. Though such a result may look like an oversight, it was a deliberate choice to avoid the potential disappointment of having a player character taken down by a single attack, especially an unexpected attack or one against which the character cannot defend himself. In certain situations, however, this choice becomes ludicrous. In these cases, apply the following rule. Normally, after a weapon's Damage Level has been staged up to \"D,\" additional successes are ignored. If the Power of the attack is greater than twice (2x) the Body Rating of the target, the gamemaster may invoke the Over-Damage rule. With this rule, every 2 additional successes translate into 1 additional point of damage applied against the Physical Condition Monitor (if the attack was Deadly Stun) or Body Overflow (if the attack was Deadly Physical). For example, using the OverDamage rule, assume a character with a Body of 3 is struck by a 7M attack. The attacker stages the damage for a final Damage Level of Deadly, with an additional 4 successes remaining in the attacker's favor. The character takes a Deadly wound and 2 points of Body Overflow, leaving him with 1 point remaining and ten minutes until he bleeds to death. If the attacker had achieved 2 additional successes, the poor character would be instantly dead. Use this rule cautiously: in addition to conveniently killing those nasty bad guys, this rule handily kills favorite player characters who might otherwise have narrowly survived to run the shadows another day.",

The firer may use these 10 rounds to make as many fullauto bursts of between 3 and 10 rounds per burst as he wishes, up to a maximum of 10 total rounds that Combat Phase.\n-Minigun-class weapons can fire up to 15 rounds per Combat Phase using the full-auto mode rules (pp. 92-93, SRII). The weapon always fires 15 rounds if those rounds are available.\n-Super machinegun-class weapons (new to this sourcebook) fire a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat Phase. They fire six-round bursts in burst-fire mode, and full-auto bursts of between 6 and 15 rounds per burst, up to a maximum of 15 rounds per Combat Phase. The Shadowrun Combat Turn does not limit the maximum number of rounds that a weapon can discharge within that turn. The cyclic or recycle rates of the various weapons are assumed to be high enough to support the rates of fire cited above. A modern-day submachine gun has a cyclic rate of 600 rounds per minute, or 10 rounds per second. Shadowrun weapons have lower cyclic rates in the interests of game balance, practicality, survivability, and sanity.",

    "content": "Smoke can be deployed using a grenade or other smoke-producing device. The amount of smoke produced is limited by the size of the device used. How long the smoke lasts depends on the environment. If the smoke is deployed in an area with no wind, the smoke lingers in the area of impact until the duration expires. If the smoke is deployed in an area with wind, the smoke cloud will stretch and thin out in the direction the wind is blowing. Gamemasters can use the Scatter diagram (p. 97, SRII) to determine wind direction. To determine wind speed and its effects on duration, roll one six-sided die. The result is the number of Combat Turns it takes for the center (the bulk) of the smoke to drift 1 meter in the direction of the wind. Next, divide the smoke's duration by the result of the roll. The result represents the smoke's new duration as it dissipates in the wind. If the characters involved are exchanging gunfire or attempting to observe something, the gamemaster must determine on a case-by-case basis whether the characters can see through an area of thinning smoke (Light Smoke per p. 89, SRII) or if the bulk of the smoke obstructs their actions (Heavy Smoke per p. 89, SRII).\nSMOKE TABLE\n\n| Type | Area of Effect | Duration (In minutes) | Additional Effects |\n| ------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------: |\n| Grenade | 10m radius | 2 | Obscures vision (p. 89, SRII) |\n| Mortar | 15m radius | 4 | Obscures vision (p. 89, SRII) |\n| Vehicle | 10m radius cloud or 10 x 5 x 4m ribbon | 4 | Obscures vision (p. 89, SRII) |\n| Thermal | | - | Contains hot particles, obscures thermographic vision (p. 89, SRII) |",

    "content": "White phosphorus is a chemical that burns at very high temperatures when exposed to air. Early smoke grenades spread a curtain of white phosphorus, which created smoke, caused secondary-effect casualties, and ignited combustible materials. Modern (2050) smoke grenades work on the same principle, but burn a less lethal substance to create smoke. Various suppliers still produce white phosphorus weapons, but their smoke-producing effects are secondary to their incendiary and damage effects. Grenades and mortar rounds designed to deliver white phosphorus have two Damage Codes, the first representing the small blast effect of the actual explosion and the second representing the lingering effect of the white phosphorus. The chemical affects all targets within the area of effect equally. The phosphorous burns continuously for 15 Combat Turns, inflicting the indicated damage every Combat Turn (resolved at the start of each turn during the first Combat Phase). Characters can resist this damage using Body dice only. Impact Armor reduces the Power of the attack. White phosphorus is difficult to extinguish because it re-ignites whenever exposed to air. Water diffuses white phosphorus; if an affected area or target can be immersed or doused with water, the chemical's effects end in 2 Combat Turns.",
