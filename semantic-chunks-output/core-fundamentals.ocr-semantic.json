Then listen, chummer, learn everything you can, cuz ignorance will kill ya faster than a fireball.\n-Ess EI EI, Snake shaman\n\nShadowrun Second Edition (SRII) is a revision of the original Shadowrun rules first published in 1989. Using extensive feedback from players and gamemasters, SRII has been revised and rewritten for greater clarity and to provide cleaner, faster play. Players and gamemasters familiar with the first edition rules will find the heart of the game unchanged and the changes consistent with the game's existing logic. The SRII rules contain new material, some clarifying existing material, and some revising and expanding the rules and information published in sourcebooks like *The Grimoire*, *Virtual Realities*, *Rigger Black Book*, *ShadowTech*, and others. These additions reflect continuing thought and design work on the system. The Sourcebook Updates section provides notes and rules modifications pertaining to each of the published sourcebooks/rules supplements for Shadowrun, bringing the information in those books into line with the SRII rules. SRII does NOT make other Shadowrun products obsolete.\n\n---",

Stronger, smarter, faster is the human of today.\n\nIn the world of 2053, the metroplexes are monsters casting long shadows. And it’s in the cracks between the giant corporate structures that shadowrunners find their home. When the megacorps want a job done but they don’t want to dirty their hands, it’s a **shadowrun** they need, and they turn to the runners who are the only ones who can do it. Though a shadowrunner’s existence is not listed in any governmental or corporate database, the demand for his or her services is high. She might be a **decker**, sliding like a whisper through the visualized databases of giant corporations, spiriting away the only thing of real value—information. Or perhaps he is a **street samurai**, an enforcer for hire whose combat skills and reflexes make him the ultimate urban predator. Or perhaps he or she is a **magician**, possessing an ancient gift, the ability to wield and shape the magical energies that now surrounds the Earth. And that’s exactly the kind of firepower you’ll need if you get hired to make a Shadowrun...\n\n---",

    "content": "The world of Shadowrun, known to denizens of the new age as the **Sixth World**, is a place of magic and high technology, a landscape of danger and mystery, a maze of noble sentiments and double-crosses. Those who play stand on the edge, in the shadow of adventure.\n\nWelcome.\n\n**Shadowrun** is a roleplaying game designed for two to eight players. Unlike most such games, however, it is open-ended, with no time limit, specified number of turns to play, or single goal to reach that ends the game. And unlike most games, there is no winner and no loser. The object is to have fun with the exercise of imagination. When this happens, everybody wins.\n\nFor those who have roleplaying game experience, some of the following will be familiar. Those readers may want to skip ahead to Game Concepts, p. 30, or turn to *And So It Came To Pass...* and delve into the history and background of the world of Shadowrun.\n\nFor those new to roleplaying, the following is an introduction. It may not answer all questions or even provide much enlightenment because the roleplaying game is more easily learned from experienced players than a book. So, absorb what you can, then seek out others who are already familiar with Shadowrun so you can learn from them by experiencing it.\n\n---",
