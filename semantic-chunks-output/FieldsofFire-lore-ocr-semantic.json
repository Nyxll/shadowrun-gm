If I'm not mistaken, he's posting these days from a Peruvian hospital (or some similar place). A few of his postings appear in the Field Pack section of this upload-which, oddly enough, seems to have been compiled backwards. The Field Pack equipment section is an older posting; you can tell by the dates. Who knows why it ended up second in the file sequence? I don't know if Matador will post comments on his own work, but it'll be more interesting if he does.) -Colonel Cobra (12:19:28/01-02-55)",

I think this material is of value to everyone, not just mercs. Pererya says a lot in here about how we should act and behave toward each other (shadowrunners take note!), so pay attention. Professionalism shouldn't be limited to self-proclaimed professionals. It's a code we should all follow.

She knows how their minds work, how they think when they are calm, how they react when they are afraid.

She knows how to reason with others, how to explain her own and her opponent's position, how to listen and make others listen.\nThe mercenary is always prepared.

You are not in control-you are a company man. MET 2000 does not allow its employees to bail out of a contract, and the organization has an arm long enough to reach those who do.\n> (Matador, you goronit, you hate MET 2000 because we skinned your hide last year. Admit it!) -MET 2000 Observer (04:20:19/01-13-55)\n> (If you believe that's what happened, you're even more of a corporate toad than I thought.) -Matador (13:51:10/01-14-55)\n\nNot every merc shares my point of view on this subject. In fact, a few thousand employees of MET 2000 would probably disagree with me. (By the way, don't blindly accept any published MET 2000 membership numbers. I have it on good authority that those numbers are grossly inflated.) I respect the choice of those who disagree with me. And for others who might find such indentured servitude desirable, I provide a short list of the better-known and financially respected international mercenary companies. Friends of mine have worked for these companies with what they consider desirable results.\nMET 2000 (Germany)\nBrightEdge (Morocco)\nTsunami (Japan/Far East)\n10,000 Daggers (Constantinople)\nCombat Inc.

    "content": "The League is a phenomenon that I can only describe as the international brotherhood of mercenaries. No formal organization, no meeting place, no dues, and no newsletter for the League exist. In fact, nothing exists to identify this group as a group. Yet all mercenaries are members of the League simply by virtue of their profession as soldiers of fortune.\nAll members of the League should treat each other with respect and fairness, as long as they deserve it. A fool who jeopardizes himself and others through idiotic posturing and ill-considered actions has lost his place in the brotherhood, and deserves only contempt.\nThe tradition of fair treatment especially applies to your opponent. Your opposite number took a job with the other side for the same reason you agreed to work for your side. Don't treat opposing mercenaries unfairly just because the conflict becomes ugly. Remember such simple niceties as respect and consideration, and others will show those qualities toward you.\n> (Honestly, the drek these mercs dream up to keep themselves off the emotional hook. \"I'm in the League so I don't have to suffer the incarceration and torture being inflicted on the regular troops I served with. Pass the tea please, will you?\" Makes me vomit.) -Mother Maker (02:18:32/01-15-55)",

    "title": "MAGICAL INTEGRATION",
    "content": "Magic is so prevalent these days that I don't bother to make a distinction between standard and \"mystical\" assets. My attitude, however, remains unique. Corporations, especially, foolishly insist on grouping paranatural assets together and thinking of them as separate from their security or military assets. Mercenaries use magic in every situation where it seems appropriate, but mostly to accomplish tasks as efficiently as possible. Magic is ideal for surveillance and recon work because it enables you to pick up a lot of information at low risk and low exposure. Magic also offers many advantages in anti-espionage work, securing your physical site, and protecting your own assets.\nMagic has very little offensive value, simply because too few mages are in the field to wage effective magical warfare. Special ops regularly use mages to great effect, but magic offers few advantages to other operations. Employers sometimes attach a magician to a field ops unit, but only if the field unit has a specific objective that can be achieved most efficiently using magic. I personally know of only one or two units that permanently include a magician. \n> (Again, what about the Tir secession from NAN? Seems like lots of combat magic went down there!) -Loodles (13:39:40/01-14-55)\n> (Read the battle reports again, Loodles. My read is that the Tir used invisibility to conceal their forces. It was 2036; if the CNC weren't concerned enough about such possibilities to guard against them, then they got what was coming to them. On the other hand, I suspect that all the tales of combat magic from those battles were somewhat exaggerated.) -Colonel Cobra (11:46:04/11-15-55)\n\nWhen a magician takes part in an operation, he should be deployed as a special weapons team and sent where needed. Currently, magicians primarily fill recon and defensive roles. I suspect those roles will someday change, but most likely not until long after I leave the business.",

Few nations or corps have or are willing to spend the vast financial resources needed for such a venture. As always, manpower is cheap but the tools of warfare are not. Subterfuge, espionage, and counterespionage have replaced armies of tanks as the tools for solving national problems.\nThis is good.\nSure, ultimately it means less work for me, but it also means fewer threats to life and limb for everyone else. I'd rather see the world's problems resolved with small skirmishes, police actions, and brushfire wars. Better that than the alternative.\nWhat does this mean for my profession? It means we must adapt. I believe that future battles will be fought by small units wielding incredibly sophisticated weapons capable of focusing more firepower than you or I can even imagine, and magic will also play an important part.\nI foresee that the soldier of the future will be part mage, part mercenary, and part metal. Mercs like us won't be part of that battlefield. We will still be part of the battlefield where the real people fight. We'll be where people bleed, and hurt, and fight for causes they believe in. We'll be standing next to them, waiting for the charge. Maybe I'll see you there.\n> (Don't count on it.) -Smiley (21:17:17/01-04-55)",
