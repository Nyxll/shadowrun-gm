There are only a few points to consider. A dual being, shackled to the flesh, can only move at speeds and ways dictated by its physical form. An astrally projecting character can break off combat with such an opponent by moving out of its reach, dodging through a wall, or by some other similar tactic.\n\nWhen both opponents can move with equal freedom, how-ever, an Astral Evasion Test is needed to resolve any attempts to break off combat and/or evade pursuit. Both participants roll dice, using Astral Quickness for normal movement, or the characters' Magic Ratings for fast movement. (Normal movement allows the character to break off, while still remaining in the general area. Fast movement takes the character a great distance in no time at all.) If one of the participants chooses to let the other escape, no test is needed. Spirits always use their Force Ratings.\n\nThe target number for this test is the opponent's Astral Quickness, Magic Rating, or Force, as appropriate.\n\nThe opponent with the greater number of successes decides what happens. At normal movement rates, the character can move away from the opponent the distance his astral projection speed would allow. At fast movement, the character can evade the opponent completely, leaving the area. Alternatively, the winner can maintain combat range and can attack.\n\n---",

Odds are that this will be longer than the magician is able to maintain astral projection. The magician can, however, leave off the search at some point to take a rest. At the time the magician resumes the search, he must make an Intelligence or Magic (whichever is higher) Test against a target number equal to the number of hours, or part thereof, that has passed since he left off tracking. As long as he scores at least 1 success, the search continues. If he scores no successes, the trail is lost.\n\n---",
