You never knew if your partner was going to suddenly grow fangs.\n-Pat Mifflin, retired police officer\n\nToday, in 2053, the world is radically different from that of our great-grandfathers. Where once powerful nations dominated the globe, threatening each other with sudden nuclear annihilation, many smaller, autonomous nations exist, and corporations have taken over the superpowers' once-immense authority. Our science and technology, too, set us apart, with current levels making previous advances look like a child's experiments with a science kit. But that is not all that divides our age irrevocably from the past, for magic has emerged again on Earth and we live in an Awakened world.\n\n---",

Alarmed at the state of social and political affairs, the corporations feared to trust their interests to indifferent or, in their eyes, incompetent governments.

As the tide of civil disobedience and urban violence began to engulf every nation on the globe, the corporations began transferring their paramilitary assets wherever needed. The stage was set.",

    "title": "RESOURCE RUSH",
    "content": "With their new freedom, the corporations of North America increased their exploitation of the continent's resources with a vengeance. In what the media dubbed \"the Resource Rush,\" corporate coalitions demanded and were granted access to oil, mineral, and land resources on federal lands. In the years 2002-8, the government invoked the right of eminent domain again and again to bring property under its control, only to license its exploitation to a corporate sponsor. Taking the brunt of this land-grab were the Indian reservations and federal parklands.\n\nConservationists and Indian-rights groups expressed their shock and disgust, though corporate influence and paramilitary power made it dangerous to object. Angry and frustrated, the more radical elements founded the Sovereign American Indian Movement (SAIM), whose roots traced back to the Indian-rights struggles of the twentieth century.\n\nThe growing tensions and hatred finally erupted in 2009. On May 5, United Oil Industries announced that it had acquired the right to exploit the petrochemical resources in one-quarter of the remaining federal parks and one-tenth of the Indian lands, which the government had just confiscated. The SAIM reacted immediately. A small band entered the U.S. Air Force's Shiloh Launch Facility in northwest Montana, capturing a missile silo. To this day, no one knows how the raiders managed to bypass the security patrols, but once inside the missile silo, they met up with John Redbourne, a USAF major and a full-blood Dakota Sioux. After knocking his partner unconscious, Redbourne used the man's keys and codes to unlock the launch fail-safes.\n\n---",

    "content": "Issuing a demand for the return of all Indian land, the Shiloh raiders threatened to launch the facility's missiles. Ten days of tense negotiations ended when a black-garbed Delta Team invaded the silo. During the struggle, which resulted in the death of all the occupying Indians, a single Lone Eagle intercontinental ballistic missile carrying four MIRVed five-megaton warheads launched.\n\nNORAD command in Cheyenne Mountain watched helplessly as the missile headed for the Russian Republic. All their auto-destruct signals went unheeded, and the military had no interceptors in position to down the bird. Though denying responsibility for the launch, President Jesse Garrety informed Moscow of the targets of each of the missile's multiple warheads, hoping to avert a full-scale retaliation by giving the Russians enough warning to use their semi-secret ballistic defenses to stop the missile.\n\nMoscow was understandably skeptical of Washington's claims that the Lone Eagle launching was an isolated accident and not a trick for making a surgical strike against selected Russian targets. They put their forces on full alert and ordered citizens of the Commonwealth of Independent States to shelters. Meanwhile, in the United States, the public was unaware that it was perilously close to nuclear war.\n\nPresident Garrety waited anxiously, and as later revealed in the celebrated \"back-room tapes,\" he alternately wept, ranted, and prayed. A short time later, Russian President Nikolai Chelenko tersely informed Garrety that the warheads had been stopped. A privately conducted stress analysis of Chelenko's voice later indicated only a 79 percent probability that he spoke the truth, but neither seismic nor space-based sensors recorded any nuclear explosions at that time. Explosion or not, there was definitely fallout from the incident.\n\n---",

    "content": "When the American public learned of the Lone Eagle crisis, the outcry was enormous. Goaded by corporate propagandists, the people began to blame SAIM, and by implication, all Native Americans. This fit well with the larger plans of the megacorporations, principally United Oil Industries, which was not satisfied with the pace of its mineral-asset acquisition. By 2010, the corporations had pressured the government to pass the Re-Education and Relocation Act, originally introduced late in 2009. This new law called for the confinement of anyone connected in any way to SAIM. Abuses of the law were rampant because of the general hatred of Indians. Thousands of innocent Native Americans were sent to concentration camps, euphemistically called \"re-education centers.\" Among those shipped to the Abilene camp was a man named Daniel Coleman, future Prophet of the Great Ghost Dance and the first war shaman of the Native American Nations. History remembers him as Daniel Howling Coyote.\n\nIn a governmental economy measure, Congress soon contracted out management of the re-education camps to the corporations. As the camps gradually dropped out of the media spotlight, overcrowding, poor sanitation, and insufficient medical care began to plague the inmates. Was this a deliberate plan of genocide, as Coleman would one day claim? In one of the great ironies of history, however, the isolation of many tribes in the re-education camps spared them from the scourge that hit the world in 2010.\n\n---",

In the worst epidemic since the Black Plague, a significant percentage of the world's people were dead or dying by the end of 2010. Most fatalities were in outlying areas where medical care was unavailable or in high-population centers where supplies of medicines and interim vaccines were insufficient. China, India, many African nations, and many densely populated Third World cities suffered disproportionately because their medical delivery systems could not provide adequate symptomatic relief.\n\nTragic as the VITAS plague was, it was only the beginning of unprecedented chaos. Beginning with the violent dissolution of the Mexican government in January 2011, more governments fell in the next five years than in any similar span in history. Famine stalked the world, adding to the already-lengthy rolls of the dead. Massive civilian protests led to raids on European nuclear power plants, three of which suffered meltdowns. Radiation fallout was extensive and damaging.\n\n---",

I was scared, though, what with the spooky way them Injuns was acting. When the others started firing, I did, too. But the Injuns just kept walking. And that Coleman fella was kinda like glowing. I know the scientists say it was just a trick of the light, some kind of reflection from the lightning. I still swear I hit him clean two or three times, but he just kept on walking.\nWhen they got to the gate, which had blown open in the wind, they just waltzed right on out. We didn't go after them that night 'cause of the storm. Next morning, we couldn't find a trace. It was really weird.\n-Testimony given before the Abilene Official Investigating Commission, by Harry Wood, a guard at the Abilene Re-education Center on December 24, 2011\n\nOn the heels of VITAS came the frightening phenomenon later named Unexplained Genetic Expression, or UGE. All over the world, mutant and changeling children were being born to \"normal\" parents. Newsweek dubbed these UGE children \"elves and dwarfs,\" and it seemed that the Apocalypse had finally arrived. The year 2011 is now remembered as the Year of Chaos.\n\nWith miracles and calamities being reported in every nation, religions rose and died. Prophets appeared, proclaiming the end of the world. One of these emerged from the despair of a re-education camp. On December 24, at the same moment that hundreds of Japanese witnessed the first appearance of the great dragon Ryumyo as they sped past Mount Fuji on a bullet train, the Prophet of the Great Ghost Dance, Daniel Howling Coyote, led his followers out of the Abilene Re-Education Center.\n\nBy then, there was no question: magic had returned to the world.\n\n---",

Where were these signs and events? It is true that the world faced trials, disasters, and great change, but it is not a new world. It's still good, old Mother Earth, even if she has entered a new phase.\n\nA better model of the change is the historical shift from B.C. to A.D. No one alive at the time knew it had happened.

His words were strong, too. He spoke of a new Ghost Dance—a Great Ghost Dance. This time, he said, the magic would work. Unlike the dance our ancestors performed, this one would shatter the oppressive yoke of the white man. He told us that the old prophets had been partly right. Their vision had been clouded, and they had not seen the time for the dance. The world was not yet ready then, but now the time had come. His eyes were bright when he spoke those words, and I believed him. In the morning, he was gone from our hidden camp, but he remained in our hearts.",

The assassins of Chelenko, Schon, and Rodale were ultimately killed in violent confrontations. William Springer, the men identified as Garrety's assassin, was never captured.\n\nWilliam Jarman, the new U.S. president, issued the now infamous Executive Order 17-321 immediately upon taking office. One month later, Congress ratified it with the Resolution Act of 2016. The corrupt government had sanctioned Jarman's plan to resolve \"the Indian question\": total extermination of all Native American tribes.\n\nWhile the government huddled with the megacorporations to plan their strategy, Howling Coyote's people had quietly begun their own solution to the \"Indian question.\" It is now known that the Great Ghost Dance began in 2017, as men and women of the tribes all across the continent performed the ritual that Howling Coyote had taught them. They sang his songs and chanted his chants. Their power grew.\n\nWhen the government moved to implement the Resolution Action of 2016, several months of freak weather and other uncanny disturbances disrupted military bases and supply dumps assigned to the plan. With each new delay, the president sacked another general, but refused to commit his forces piecemeal. By August 17, 2017, the government had finally managed to assemble its troops, and the operation began to roll.\n\nThat morning, at 10:32 A.M. Pacific Standard Time, Mount Hood, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and Mount Adams all erupted in cataclysmic fury. Mother Earth had announced whose side she was on, and even the most skeptical became believers.\n\n---",
