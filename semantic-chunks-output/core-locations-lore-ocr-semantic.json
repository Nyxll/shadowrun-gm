    "content": "# THE MODERN NORTHWEST\n\n> When the politicians gave away the damn country to the Indians, I didn't know who to kill first, the politicians or the Indians.\n> -Humanis Policlub member\n\nThe northwestern quarter of North America is bordered by the **Pacific Ocean** on the west and **mountain ranges** that divide the coast from the rest of the continent on the east. In between is a diverse assortment of lesser features, including plateaus, river systems, valleys, and smaller mountain ranges. Indeed, the Northwest offers almost every type of environment found elsewhere on the continent. Glaciers and deserts, temperate rainforests and badlands, all exist within the area.\n\nSince the **Treaty of Denver in 2018**, much has changed in the western half of North America. Under the protection of the **Native American Nations (NAN)**, much of the land has been returned to its earlier, natural state. The lowered population and the influx of the **Awakened** has resulted in a landscape vastly different from the shrinking wilderness of the late 20th century. Tall trees stand unmolested by loggers, sheltering strong populations of both natural and paranatural animals. Towns and villages are vanishing under the new growth as the land renews itself.\n\nPolitically, the Northwest is no less changed. Several **sovereign nations** now exist there, with little remaining of the former jurisdictions of the United States and Canadian governments. Today the dominant powers of the region are the various states of the Native American Nations and the elven realm of **Tir Tairngire**. In and among these large political entities are smaller independent states, most notably, the independent Native American nation of **Tsimshian**.",

    "content": "The Treaty of Denver stipulated that the **Seattle-Everett-Tacoma metroplex** was to remain part of the United States of America as the **City-State of Seattle**. The Sovereign Tribal Council accepted this demand, apparently as much because of the Seattle area's importance as a port as for the difficulties involved in returning the area to its pristine condition. When the United Canadian and American States were split by the secession of the Confederated American States, Seattle remained with the **UCAS**.\n\nAs the last, true city in the Northwest, the Seattle-Everett-Tacoma sprawl has become the principal concentration of UCAS governmental power in the region. This urban complex remains an important center of commerce and a vital center for trade with members of NAN, Tir Tairngire, and the nations of the Pacific Rim. It is a lonely city, its former neighboring states having shrunk in size, been abandoned, or been relinquished to Native American, Awakened, or corporate landholders. Though the city-state remains an official part of the UCAS, these ties grow more tenuous by the year as Seattle's local government finds the attractions of independence more and more seductive.",

When **Tir Tairngire** was admitted to the **United Nations** two years later, its sovereignty was established beyond a doubt.\n\nMuch of Tir Tairngire's original population was native to the Northwest. Metahumans, mostly **elves** and **dwarves**, migrated from their homes to this new promised land, whose rulers offered a home to metahumans from any nation. This influx of the Awakened strengthened the claim of **High Prince Lugh Surehand**, Tir Tairngire's ruler, that his was the realm of magic.\n\nThe High Prince is an **absolute monarch**, but he is advised by the **Council of Princes**, whose members are all absolute rulers of smaller domains within the realm. There are $15$ seats in the Council, most of them held by elves. Two members are dwarfs and two are dragons. One sasquatch and one ork also have seats.\n\nThe borders of Tir Tairgire are **closed**. Visas are issued occasionally, with favoritism shown toward metahumans, but the realm's boundaries and airspace are heavily patrolled and guarded by technology, magic, and, it is rumored, dragons. Few succeed in crossing illegally. Most who try are dumped near their point of entry, with little or no memory of their experiences and no desire to return.

There is no limit to the number of terms a governor can serve. The current governor, now in her fourth term, is the **Honorable Marilyn Schultz**.\n\nThe governor is advised by a **bicameral council**, composed of the **Cabinet** and the **Congress**. Cabinet members serve a six-year term and form an immediate-action body. Congressmen serve two-year terms. They promulgate laws with the approval of the council and the governor, and serve as a review and ratification board for gubernatorial and special executive orders. All members of the council, except the non-voting Salish-Shidhe Council representative to the Cabinet, are elected.\n\nAll registered voters are subject to a city tax. Travel passes, transit taxes, transient worker taxes, business licensing fees, and donations make up the rest of the city's income base. The city uses these taxes to contract for essential services with independent corporations. Some of the primary services and their contractors are:\n\n* **Police Services:** Lone Star Security Services\n* **Fire Control:** Franklin Associates, Inc.\n* **Sanitation:** Various district contractors\n* **Public Works Maintenance:** Shiawase Envirotech\n* **Public Database:** Renraku Computer Systems\n* **Grid-Guide System:** Sony Tech\n* **Power:** Gaeatronics (Salish-Shidhe Council), Shiawase Atomics",

In practice, the city-state is defended by the **Metroplex Guard**, the bulk of which are recruited and trained locally, though the unit is officially part of the UCAS military. Seattle also benefits from its location in the heart of the Salish-Shidhe Council lands, counting on the Council and the NAN states to preserve stability in the region.\n\nThe Guard is a mechanized infantry force of **three battalions** and an attached air defense company. Its soldiers are a mixture of full-time professionals and part-time reservists. They are equipped with antiquated vehicles and weapons that are outclassed by the various corporate security and hireling police forces. Staff and field officers, who are drawn from among UCAS officers, former mercenaries, and political appointees, rotate through the three battalions of the Seattle Guard, though the commanding colonel is a regular UCAS officer. This system results in uneven troop quality and morale, a problem aggravated by the Guard's part-time nature.\n\n* **First Battalion** maintains $15$ Ares Citymasters, two of which are modified as urban assault vehicles and a third as air defense.\n* **Second Battalion** operates with $15$ standard Citymasters.\n* **Third Battalion** is air mobile, with ten modified Federated Boeing Commuter tilt-rotors and a pair of Ares Dragons.\n\nThe Guard can be activated by either the governor or by executive order of the city council, though such action must be ratified by the city-state Congress within $48$ hours. Should the Congress disapprove of activation, the law provides for strict sanctions against those responsible for the abuse. A full call-up of UCAS forces would activate the Guard and place the commanding colonel under direct military orders.",

The system has the additional benefit of minimal power costs, as the cost of power drawn from the system is included in the motorist's use license. Previous reports in other travel guides notwithstanding, Seattle's first-class, high-speed lanes are well-insulated and their power connections safe. Near the grid, there are power-recharging stations at many commercial establishments and all public parking facilities.\n\nPublic roads are well-maintained and full of electric cars, bikes, and buses. **Petrochem vehicles** are also common in the area, but strict anti-pollution standards are in effect, with such vehicles reserved for important business or occasions when high performance is required.\n\nSeattle's famed **monorail**, once limited to runs between Seattle Center and the downtown district, has recently been refurbished and expanded. It now runs on a ring track and serves the Renraku Arcology and other residential buildings. Visitors may experience some delay in receiving a travel pass, as the monorail is popular with commuters and is often filled to capacity with regular travelers.\n\nThe **Renraku Arcology**, like other corporate structures, maintains its own landing pads for intracity and city-airport service of rotor and tilt-rotor aircraft. Unlike the others, Renraku offers three public pads with full storage, refueling, and repair facilities. Charges are reasonable and service is swift and reliable.",

Members of the ork community who reside there offer tours of the small areas of old Seattle on display since the last century, along with the expanding tunnels and quaint village life of the inhabitants. A liability waiver is required.\n* The latest major addition to Seattle's growing business district is the **Renraku Arcology**. Even though incomplete, this structure is overwhelming. It contains private homes for a small town. Its public mall on the first five levels, the extensive aquarium and algae-farming facility in the over-the-Sound extension, and the lively **Club Quarter** on the north face all offer an unforgettable experience.
