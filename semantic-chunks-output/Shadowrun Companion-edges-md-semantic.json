Edges and Flaws enable players to modify and flesh out their characters by providing them with specific advantages (Edges) and disadvantages (Flaws). Unlike the character-creation variations described earlier in this section, Edges and Flaws do not represent an 'across-the-board' system of altering player characters; each individual player selects specific Edges and Flaws for his or her character, or may decline to use this option at all. This allows Edges and Flaws to be used with any of the variant character-creation systems or with the standard system provided in the *Shadowrun* rulebook.",

For example, a player might select Ambidexterity (2 points), Color Blind (-1 point), and Combat Monster (-1 point) for his character. Players can purchase Edges and Flaws in the same manner using the point-based character-creation system, or gamemasters may allow their players to use Building Points when selecting Edges and Flaws. In this case, a player can spend Building Points to buy Edges or increase the number of Building Points he has available by the point value of any Flaws he takes. For example, a player who takes the Flaw of Blind (-6 points) can add 6 Building Points to his allowance.",

Depending on the type of campaign the gamemaster runs and the desired backgrounds of his players' characters, an assumed lack of formal education might not fit the group's gaming style. The gamemaster can handle this several ways, the easiest of which is simply to not allow education-based Edges and Flaws to be used in the game (Illiterate, Uneducated, High School Education, Technical School Education, College Education). A lack of formal education does not mean that a character is stupid or illiterate, only that he or she does not hold a graduation certificate or other degree. A character may be self-taught: he may have completed all the necessary coursework for a certificate or degree but still owe the educational institution money.",
