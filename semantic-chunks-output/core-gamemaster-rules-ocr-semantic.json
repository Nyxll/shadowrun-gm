If players and the gamemaster do not agree with the working of a particular rule, or more important, how it feels, they are free to change it.

The gamemaster, meanwhile, will want to know whether the player characters saw that all-important clue or whether they inadvertently kicked it under the trash.\n\nFor many of these situations, gamemasters will have to rely on their own judgment to decide which skills are needed for the situation, to determine the target numbers and situation modifiers, and to interpret what a \"success\" means.

Or smell the chromed ork hiding under an invisibility spell.\n\nTo determine what a character is aware of in such situations, the gamemaster tests the character's **perception**. He uses the character's Intelligence Rating for the number of dice to roll; the target number will depend on the circumstances.\n\nAn individual making a Perception Test should roll the dice as described above. The gamemaster may want to make one Perception Test for the entire team, but this should not be done when surprise is possible (as described on p. 86 of Combat). For a group Perception Test, find the average Intelligence Rating for the team and roll that many dice plus an additional die for each member of the team.\n\nA Perception Test can be made for any situation that involves one of the five senses; sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste. Set the base Target Number at 4 and use the Perception Test Modifiers Table to determine appropriate modifiers. The table is not meant to cover every situation, but merely to offer some guidelines.\n\nSome things, like the Concealability of guns, have specific numbers assigned to them, as listed in the Equipment Table in the Gear section of the rules, p. 254. The Perception Test should be made against that number.\n\nA single success indicates that someone has noticed something.

    "title": "GAME LETHALITY",
    "content": "Face it, not everyone likes the same thing in a game. One of the biggest points of contention is how lethal a combat system should be, especially for a dark, gritty game like Shadowrun. Some players and gamemasters want a \"realistic\" system, where any punk with a gun is a threat. Others prefer a combat style like those found in pulp-fiction or action films, where the major criteria of success is the number of rounds fired. Others like it somewhere in the middle.\n\nTo that end (and to keep everybody happy) the design of the Shadowrun system allows the gamemaster to adjust combat lethality. As written, the game is pretty deadly. A punk with a gun and decent skill is definitely a threat. Gamemasters and players who like that style should use the rules as written. For a less-lethal game, increase all armor's Ballistic Armor Rating by 50 percent (round up). For an even less lethal system, double the Ballistic Armor Ratings. In all instances, the rating of impact armor should remain the same. The gamemaster can also make other adjustments.\n\nMelee combat, as written, is fairly survivable. To make it more lethal, increase the Power Ratings of the attacks by 50 percent. For really deadly combat, double the calculated Power. (We do not advise this. Who wants to deal with a troll that can hit with a Power of 24+?)\n\nIf magic seems too powerful, double the base Drain target number from one-half Force to Force. This adjustment does not make magic any less deadly, but it will give magicians second thoughts about the power of the spells they want to cast. If the magic in the game is really too powerful, then use Force as the base Drain target number, and halve the Spell Resistance target numbers.\n\nMatrix combat can be balanced by adjusting Security Ratings and IC Ratings.\n\nRemember, though, that none of these options is more right than any other-it's all a question of taste. As always, players and gamemasters should agree on any modifications to the rules before beginning play.\n\n---",

Players can never be absolutely certain of the capabilities of the opposition; a chance always exists that the power will work slightly differently in this particular critter. Uncertainty is a wonderful dramatic tool. Because elementals and nature spirits may be summoned, their powers should remain as consistent as possible.]",

All elven authorities and many paranatural specialists deny that a banshee is an elf.\n**Similar Species:** The vampire (p. 231) and the wendigo (p. 232) share certain close similarities with this creature.\n**Habitat:** The banshee prefers desolate places near human habitations.\n**Magic Capability:** Many innate abilities, including evidence of active magic capability among some specimens.\n**Habits:** Nocturnal. The banshee is solitary and reclusive except when hunting. Unlike the vampire, it appears to survive completely on Essence derived from its terrified victims. The creature wails, instilling fear to the point of blind panic in its prey, which will flee in mindless terror. The banshee pursues until its victim is physically exhausted, then closes for the kill. The final attack is, apparently, a form of assault, which leaves its target an apparent victim of cardiac arrest. The banshee rarely shows any restraint, almost always draining a victim in the initial attack.\n**Range:** Worldwide\n**Commentary:** Paranaturalist Charles Forte has advanced the hypothesis that the banshee is the typical expression of HMHVV (Human-Metahuman Vampiric Virus) in elves.\n**Powers:** Enhanced Senses (Low-Light Vision; Smell; Hearing), Essence Drain, Fear, Immunity (Age, Pathogens, Toxins), Mist Form, Regeneration\n**Weaknesses:** Allergy (Sunlight, Severe), Essence Loss, Vulnerability (Wood, Silver)",

Its tail measures .7 meters, and its typical weight is 80 kilograms. The barghest resembles an oversized mastiff of pure white or pure black. Its fur is very short and lies flat on its body, which sometimes gives the impression of a naked hide. Its ears are sharply pointed and set high on its head. A protruding spine runs along the back. Even in the absence of reflected light, the barghest's eyes shine red and its teeth glow slightly in the dark because of luminescent bacteria in its saliva. Its skull has 42 teeth. The female barghest has eight mammae.\n**Similar Species:** At night, the barghest is often confused with the common hellhound (not included in this selection), especially in its black variation, but even low light reveals the distinctive wolf-like outline of the hellhound that distinguishes it easily from the barghest.\n**Habitat:** Wilderness ...",
