Get yourselves a decent headware comm setup: multi-channel, with signal compression/decompression for burst transmissions and hot-wire encryption/decryption to keep the corpers from listening in. A subvocal microphone and subdermal speakers are another must, if you want to keep Mr. Public from overhearing your nattering. Stay away from those fraggin' headset microphone combinations—any old joker can grab onto those and yank you around. Not too inconspicuous, either—a bad move in our line of work.\n\nThe best option is a pure cybernetic rig a cybercomm link that works pretty much like telepathy.",

A drek-load of new cybereye gear hits the market all the time, some of which is pretty handy. If you see two versions of something, go for the name brand or the more expensive piece; better to pay a little more for quality than go cheap and have it fail at the worst moment. When in doubt, ask around. Somebody somewhere probably uses it and can give you the clean scan.",
