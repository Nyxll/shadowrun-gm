You take a job from Mr. Johnson, do your homework, go on the run and get paid when you're finished (assuming you live). You blow your hard-earned nuyen on some nifty toys that extend your lifespan while shortening your opposition's, and as you're buying them through your fixer, you let her know you're available again. She puts out feelers and sets up a meet when she finds something promising. Repeat cycle until further notice.",

Without those shady characters to give runners an income and something to do at 02:38 on a Wednesday night, the cycle stops. Joe Runner, desperate and credless, knocks over a Stuffer Shack for groceries and 'rent' money to pay the local gangers. At 02:40 Joe Runner gets capped by the overly nervous clerk with the Mossberg behind the counter, or by a random customer with Shiawase's May 2055 batch of wired flexes who never paid attention to the recall, Joe-boy ends up cremated and dumped into a nearby lake, to become an integral part of the hard rain that eats away layers of paint on our cars and homes.",

My personal experience has given me every reason to see this inspiring piece of work as typical of Johnsons in general, even though the details may differ from Johnson to Johnson or corp to corp-so everybody read to the end of the paragraph, 'kay? Stuff like this could save your hoop, or at least get you an extra five percent in advance. And if you ever deal with Mr. Ager, you'll know exactly what to expect.",

Within three hours of putting this thing online, it had garnered nearly 800 comments. The file expanded to 14,000% of its original size because so many people had so much to add. That made for a fragging BIG post, and we just can't spare the room right now. So I did some judicious editing. All the comments that appeared within the first thirty minutes of posting I've left untouched, as word hadn't spread to every fragging bithead in the world until after an hour or so went by. The rest, I moved to a new SIG under Ager E-Pamphlet: Open Forum. If you want to say anything, say it there. But don't try to edit this file, unless you're dying to experience some bleeding-edge IC that our SS friends like to call 'Cascade Ork.' You've been warned.",
