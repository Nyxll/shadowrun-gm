    "content": "Most experienced **Shadowrun** gamemasters have faced the problem of balancing the amount of Karma and nuyen that player characters earn during a campaign. The problem of too much or too little nuyen or Karma arises because different player characters may have radically different needs. On one hand, characters reliant on technology need nuyen to maintain their cyberdecks and implants and to buy all the latest tech toys. On the other hand, using magic generally requires large amounts of Karma, and characters who use magic often become 'Karma vacuums,' never having enough Karma to accomplish what they want to do. A few characters hover in the middle, requiring both Karma and nuyen to remain effective in their role on the team. Consequently, the gamemaster must carefully dispense cash and Karma so that players have enough for their needs but not enough to unbalance the campaign.",

Such opportunities represent 'lucky breaks' that come a character's way—someone paying off an old favor, a sudden windfall, an easy score, winning the lottery, and so on. Gamemasters should determine the amount of money/resources a character receives in exchange for Karma based on the average levels of nuyen characters possess in the campaign. For example, characters in a relatively down-scale campaign might receive 100 nuyen for each Good Karma Point they cash in. In a more upscale campaign, a single Good Karma Point might be worth 1,000 nuyen. For random, infrequent windfalls, gamemasters can roll dice to determine how much money a character receives. For example, a gamemaster might determine the amount of a windfall by rolling 2D6 and multiplying the result by 10. In any case, Karma Points that are cashed in for nuyen or other assets are permanently gone, in the same way as if the character had spent the points to buy a new skill. Additionally, individual gamemasters should set their own limits on how frequently characters can cash in Karma and how much Karma they can exchange at any one time. Because the workings of Luck and Fate are unpredictable and mysterious, feel free to alter these limits throughout the course of the campaign, or set new limits for each exchange.",
