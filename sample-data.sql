(
  'Initiative',
  'Initiative determines the order in which characters act during a Combat Turn. Each character rolls Initiative Dice (usually 1d6 + Reaction) at the start of combat. The result determines when they act in each Combat Phase. Characters with higher Initiative scores act first. Initiative is rolled at the beginning of each Combat Turn.',

  'Combat Pool',
  'The Combat Pool represents a character''s ability to perform exceptional feats in combat. It equals the character''s Intelligence + Willpower. Combat Pool dice can be allocated to improve attack rolls, defense rolls, or other combat actions. Allocated dice are rolled along with the base dice pool and count toward successes. Combat Pool refreshes at the start of each Combat Turn.',

  'Target Numbers (TNs) represent the difficulty of a task. To succeed at a test, you must roll equal to or higher than the Target Number on your dice. Each die that meets or exceeds the TN counts as one success. The base TN for most actions is 4, but this can be modified by circumstances, range, visibility, and other factors.',

The stages are typically: Critical Failure (no successes), Failure (some successes but not enough), Success (minimum required successes), and Excellent Success (extra successes beyond the minimum). The number of net successes determines which stage is achieved.',
