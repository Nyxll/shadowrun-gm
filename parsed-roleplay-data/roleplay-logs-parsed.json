I rolled his Stealth correctly at 7 dice (based on his Stealth skill of 7), but I see the confusion: I didn’t roll Perception separately in the tailing scenario since Stealth was the active skill opposed by the target’s Perception. However, if a Perception roll was needed, it should’ve been 11 dice, not just referenced passively. I’ll clarify that below and correct any missteps.",

You rolled Computer 6 (Hacking) and scored 4 successes, slipping past defenses undetected. You’re now inside the maintenance network, with options to dig deeper, plant a virus, or pull intel. The enhanced Matrix rules should spice this up—let’s get cracking. --- ### Hacking Session Begins Manticore’s deck hums as he jacked into the port, his MPCP (Master Persona Control Program) at 8 and Masking at 6 keeping him slick. The host’s a Green-4 system initially, but with enhanced rules, it might scale up or throw new threats. What specific enhancements are we using? For now, I’ll assume: - Standard Green-4 host: Security Tally 4, IC Rating 4, System 6. - Enhanced rules might add faster response times, new IC types (e.g., Black Hammer, Crash), or higher stakes. Here’s your move: you want to root around, find critical data, or weaken the HQ’s defenses. What’s the target—vault security, guard schedules, or something else? - Action: Hack deeper into the host. - Stats: Computer 6, Hacking Pool 18, Electronics 5. - Gear: Cyberdeck (MPCP 8), Programs (Analyze 6, Deception 6, Attack 6). - Intent: Gather intel on the vault or sabotage security. Let’s roll with standard rules first, and you jump in with the enhanced tweaks: - Hacking Test: Computer 6 + Hacking Pool 6 (max for this test) vs. TN 4 (Green-4 host). - Roll: → 8 successes. - Result: You’re in deep, past the initial firewall. The host’s system shows vault schematics, a Rating 7 maglock, and a patrol drone schedule (every 30 minutes). No IC yet, but the Security Tally inches to 5—time’s short before countermeasures kick in. Now, throw in those enhanced rules. Are there new ICs, like a Rating 5 Tar Baby or Blaster? Do responses escalate faster? Let me know, and I’ll adjust mid-hack. --- ### Next Steps You’ve got the foothold. Options: - Pull Data: Grab vault codes, guard shifts, or drone weaknesses. - Plant Virus: Slow down security or crash the drones. - Push Deeper: Hit the Red-6 host for core systems, but that’s riskier. What’s Manticore’s next move, and what do those enhanced Matrix rules change? I’m ready to roll—give me the details, and we’ll make this hack epic. Human: Here are the enhanced Matrix rules from the Google Drive for our Shadowrun 2nd Edition game, specifically tailored for a more dynamic and challenging hacking experience. These rules build on the core SR2 Matrix system but add depth, new threats, and increased strategic options. I'll apply these to Manticore's current hacking session at the sewer jackpoint near Neo-Tokyo Dynamics HQ. --- ### Enhanced Matrix Rules Overview 1. Host Security Escalation: - All hosts now have a Dynamic Security Tally that increases faster based on hacker actions. Each successful hack adds 1 to the Security Tally,",
